3.0,"Super cute! However, I was expecting it to be a tad longer as it says it is a dress. But i can wear this with my leggings and a cardigan and a cute scarf and it still looks great!!"
3.0,"This dress doesn't look nothing like the picture it's a very pail light pink and the material is like a stiff hard cotton which means you have to iron it ,but when she put it on it looks nice on her"
3.0,"I only received nine,not 10"
3.0,This is made of cotton and not stretch material and you can tell it will collect all the lent.
3.0,"unlined, but has pockets and is well-fitting according to the sizes posted here. I like the style."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful, nice fit. The material however is much thinner than I expected. I ordered this same dress in the blue/white color, and I thought the material would be the same as that one."
3.0,Didn't expect it to be too small but it's cute.
3.0,So cute. Love the fabric. But at least a size or two smaller than other common brands like Carters.
3.0,Bought a blk one. I got Xxl because Chinese sizes always run two to three sizes smaller fits like a long shirt.  Nothing like in pics.
3.0,"I have a giant Irish head and usually search for glasses that fit.  These however, are comically large.  Double check the measurements of your globe before ordering."
3.0,Se par√≥ despu√©s de 2 semanas de uso
3.0,Love the design but made cheaply and moon and tree were disconnected when I got it. We fixed it and it looked really nice but it is cheap
3.0,"They look nice- but don‚Äôt quite hang perfectly straight. Based on the price, though, they are worth it."
3.0,Their cute but a little pricey for the quality.
3.0,too thin and not very strong
3.0,Very small. Barely fit my 4 year old
3.0,Does not fit well around the neck
3.0,"I like it, it is warm. Just a little to small though."
3.0,"Nice cut, but it runs small and is very tight in the chest.  I am a D cup and ut is uncomfortably tight. Also, the hunter green is more of a turquoise. Maybe if you are imaginative it could be considered jade. Definitely not hunter green."
3.0,The straps on the bottom is too large
3.0,"The socks fits well and felt good.  I wore the blue ones for day's drive out of town and there was a noticeable difference in my leg stiffness.  However, the black pair had a very weak spot where the sock part meets the heel part that already looks like a hole and seems like would easily become one.  Another reviewer posted a picture of this but I decided to take a chance that it was an isolated defect but it turned out the ones I had looked the same.  Because they are not inexpensive, I decided to return these.  The return was very easy and went well."
3.0,"This is an adorable little necklace. I bought two as gifts. One I ended up not giving because the chain was all knotted up when it came, and because it is a really delicate chain I couldn't get the knot out. I ordered some necklaces from another company and they came in boxes so there were no knots, versus these necklaces that were in teeny tiny pouches so they were completely bunched up."
3.0,"Just average, but fine for a quick costume"
3.0,"The bag is high quality, but the design is not for me.  There is a button that connects the handles together and it is inconvenient.  Would love to have a magnet or something there in place... altogether, the design makes it so that unpacking and packing is timely."
3.0,I have just tried these anti glare glasses one time so I can't say how well they work. I used them for local driving and not on a major highway where there would be many cars. They seemed to work for this one time but I don't really know for sure.
3.0,Arrived with a wire poking our of the fabric. Tried on just for sizing and the top was tight. Returned.
3.0,Ordered my regular size and this bralette is very skimpy.  The strap ripped first time putting it on and when worn it does not keep the girls in.  Needs to be a little beefier.
3.0,"I love the fabric of these pajamas and the drawstring waist, but they seem to run small rather than true to size.  I would suggest sizing up for comfort"
3.0,"This is a comfortable, attractive, lightweight backpack. Nice color but part of the seams are a little crooked."
3.0,Rather small. They seem to get lost when worn by a small female. We returned the product and received a prompt refund.
3.0,"I was disappointed, I did not give this as a gift like I intended to, box was crushed and had funny smell to it."
3.0,Looks like cheap plastic on your shoes and is very very hard to take out. Tried them on both adidas superstar and chucks.
3.0,Weird material and looks nothing like tie dye
3.0,The bag was way too small for the price. I like it because you can tell it's strong and will last a while but I use it as a crossbody bag.
3.0,Only wore them once and one of the earrings broke!!  Lost the post ...will try to fix it myself.
3.0,I ordered a pink and white cable knit set which I really love. They shrink a lot in the dryer but then fit perfectly as expected. I then ordered a larger pack of cable knit and received solid.
3.0,I'm being generous w/ 3 stars. Nicely made but the fit is way off. Do not have time for returns. This product left me know choice.
3.0,The 3x was a little small but ok.
3.0,"The fit was as expected, except for the sleeves.  They were a bit short.  Also, some messy stitching in a few places, like it was bunched up.  And, as another user mentioned, if you button it, the fabric pattern doesn't match.  But it is comfortable and good to wear around the house or out in the yard."
3.0,It‚Äôs nice enough
3.0,"i found that the only way this bag LOOKS good is to fill it. - otherwise its like a limp dishrag -- i used it for a few weeks, until i just got my new vitalio vera bag today.......:)"
3.0,"I'm about 125-130lbs, 5'5&#34;, 36D, athletic, and I bought this in a Medium. I was really looking forward to wearing it because of its cool design and how supportive it looked. It covers the girls pretty well and holds them in, but the back straps are TIGHT. They dig into my back right at the shoulder blades and beneath my arms to the point where I think wearing it for a long period of time would become very uncomfortable, plus it makes my back look very unflattering."
3.0,Not noshow
3.0,"The shirt came if perfect timing for my child‚Äôs coco themed party, however I would recommend ordering a size up because they run somewhat small, other than that it‚Äôs a nice shirt, it‚Äôs been washed a handful of times and the image is still one the t shirt just fine"
3.0,it took 4 weeks or more to actually get it but it eventually came i had already returned it by then and they gave me the return and let me keep the shirt they were very kind good customer service but i wouldnt recommend it
3.0,It is what I expected. I just didn't expect the main stone to fall off as I opened the package. I assume the glue holding just wasn't enough. So I re-glued.
3.0,These are decent rings. They could have done a little better glueing the stones in but other than that they should be perfect for my teen.
3.0,"Wierd fit on top. I wear Small/size 6, but this Small fit a lil' snug - not a real issue because it's soft & comfy.  The wierd part is the gaping lace trim between the straps and the underarm seam. Not sure I'll keep the set - I sew but it'd require odd darts to fix it. üòï"
3.0,It's cool that it was cheaper than the other one I was looking at but the paint I. The middle of the dinosaur is already missing paint and starting to peel after one wash
3.0,"This dress is super cute. I felt like I needed just a bit more material in the bust area. The seam at the waist and bust needed to be just a tad lower. I have a longer torso, I'm 5'9, and I just couldn't get the bust to fit right. The dress wasn't quite tight enough to hold things in place with out a bra and with a bra the dress was either up to high and my bra fell below the bust line of the dress, which bothered me, and if adjusted lower the edge of my bra stuck out a little. I probably could get it to work with a very low cup bra but that's just too fussy for me. Like I said cute dress, just not the right fit for me."
3.0,"I ordered the large stone, and while the color was pretty, the shape was in almost a bell shape and VERY large, like 3 inches long and the shape made it very awkward looking when worn. Protruded off the chest in a very wonky fashion. Otherwise, it seemed to be good quality."
3.0,"I loved the dress. The quality was wonderful. The bottom fit great, but the top bust area was where I had an issue. I am in between a size 14 and 16 right now for tops, so it probably does fit true to size, but it didn't work for me though I can fit most XL items."
3.0,"dress is ok, for me it is too long, i am 5'3, 128lbs, it is super long for me, have to return it."
3.0,Cooling packs are useless. Had to buy separate decent ones.<br />Best itself is ok and decent value
3.0,"Although these shorts are well made and I like material of the short itself, I found the front of the shorts to be just a tad too short for me.  I am also not crazy about the high waist which is made from a spandex like material and feels a just a bit too constricting.<br /><br />Size wise, I purchased a small and at 5‚Äô7‚Äù 125 lbs, they fit me well so I would say they are true to size. There are also 2 waist pockets, a small one in the front that would your keys and not much more (see photo) but unlike the one in the back it does not zipper or fold over so items could potentially fall out. I found the inner briefs to be comfortable and sized proportionate to the shorts.  They are not see through, even in white so that‚Äôs another plus but overall, although I‚Äôm sad to say this, these shorts just weren‚Äôt for me."
3.0,Too long on calf really for it to fit well as I am shorter. Soft material
3.0,They fit a little odd but work fine
3.0,They were too small but I have size 14 feet so this is my fault.
3.0,"The slippers were decently comfy, and fit great. The elastic on the back heel really helped keeping your foot from sliding off. Nothing really bad to say about the initial impression of the slippers! After a while however, it‚Äôs gotta be washed for sure. I hand washed them in warm water because the fluffy fleece part had been matted down from wear, and the bottom of the shoe goes without saying why. I air dried them.  And noticed that end of my toes were hanging off the front. So overall, I have mixed emotions on this one lol.<br /><br />My advice is to just make sure you wash them in COLD water and air dry them for sure. Or I guess go a size larger and then wash themü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3.0,"When these arrived, I tried them on immediately and LOVED the way they look on me! My only issue is that they were scratched when I took them out of the package."
3.0,"Nice for the price, but bigger than expected"
3.0,"I like it, but it falls off of my eat constantly. If I sneeze, it slips off of the top of my ear and yanks on my earlobe. It is cool, though. I also wish that it had slightly more detail, as people keep mistaking it for one of those hands free Bluetooth headsets. It was cheap though, so I can't complain too much."
3.0,The length of the shirt is short. It doesn't look like the picture.
3.0,Not as much padding as expected may be ok on very short rides.
3.0,"The bottles are very cute and my daughter is so excited about them, but there were several pieces of broken glass in the bag and some of the bottles are busted which could be a cutting hazard (not to mention a problem if you need all the bottles for a project)"
3.0,Socks kept falling down throughout the day.
3.0,The product was very cute but it runs super small so I had to return. For reference Im 5‚Äô1 and 120 lbs and got the small. I wanted to size up but I didn‚Äôt see size medium available anymore. Oh well.
3.0,"I love these, the only thing I don't like is that when they came, one of them worked and the other one did not. I can't even get the back off to see what kind of batteries they take."
3.0,nice cuff link and i like the color
3.0,I purchased this and 2 other models. This waller wasn't the weakest and Def not the strongest. It did however come with a driver and body screws. Maybe you can actually change the elastic when it wears out? I kept for a back up.
3.0,Waist runs really small
3.0,The top is cute but runs small.  I got a XL and it was still too small.  I normally wear a medium.
3.0,"This costume is incredibly cute. I bought it for my daughter. It‚Äôs very small but fits her well. She loves it and it looks cute on. I think it runs small. The belt, arm bands and boot covers barely fit her and she‚Äôs only 10 years old. The material is nice quality.  My biggest complaint is that it arrived over a week later than expected and she missed wearing it to an event. We ordered in plenty of time it just ran very late. So I ended up having to buy a second costume for her."
3.0,the pink one is adorable and its fun jewelry. But it is on all the kids and adults this year! a must.
3.0,Not big enough at least for my face.  They are gorgeous though.
3.0,All polyester
3.0,This one does not glow in the dark however some of the others do. Still looks good
3.0,it's small.  I would purchase it for kids though.
3.0,It was not the color I chose. I ended up with a royal blue velvet long sleeve shirt. Disappointed overall but makes for a comfortable sleep shift.
3.0,"I wear size men's U.S. size 10.5 shoes and the large was too small to be fully comfortable.  My biggest problem is that they are so wide at the toes that when walking the slippers would brush together in such a way that I was worried I would trip over my own paws!  They're cute and warm, but I got rid of mine."
3.0,Pretty descent outfit for the price paid. It was a little long but otherwise not a bad product for the price paid
3.0,Thought it was different material. Too casual looking.
3.0,My daughter is 16 months and I bought the 12-18 month. The shirt fits perfect and room to grow but the romper is way too small. It didn‚Äôt specify on how to wash so I had washed it so it wouldn‚Äôt shrink. Kind of sad because it‚Äôs soo cute!!
3.0,Thicker than what I wanted; but I guess that's required for the RFID blocking capability.
3.0,"I love this dress bc it is flowy and comfortable. A bit small in the breast area. I bought an XL and wear a 36c and it is snug. but comfy for around the house, pool, beach"
3.0,I kept it but it really didnt fit all that great. definitely a bit tight in the arms but fit in the waist. very low cut in the chest though.
3.0,Rash Guard has a really cool design and came as described. I ordered a large though and it fits like a shemedium.
3.0,love this it wear so comfortable
3.0,It‚Äôs very soft but doesn‚Äôt have inside ties so it opens up when I‚Äôm walking.
3.0,"Love the softness, color and style. Order bigger if you have boobs...fades way to quick."
3.0,"It is cute enough but definitely not what I expected. The sleeves are weird. Would be better if I paid about $10 less. It is over priced for what I got. Bottoms fit well, sleeves very tight. I am going to tailor themself to fit better."
3.0,No fit to me
3.0,Nice flowy shirt. Looks great on. Color is beautiful. Fast shipping
3.0,"This was a dress I ordered as an option for attending a wedding. I liked that the color was true to the picture, and the material had a slight fuzz on the inside, making it heavy enough to drape well and prevent it from being see through. The reason I returned it was because the ""slit"" had a round top/ start instead of a pointy top/ start. I felt it made it look like a cutout instead of a slit. I am 5'4"", athletic and 128 lbs, size 2 or 3 in pants, size 0 or 1 in dresses. This dress would need 4"" or higher heel for me to wear to keep it from dragging and tripping me- or would need to be taken up. Sexy, blue, form-flattering, but not what I ended up wearing."
3.0,"These are soft and comfortable, but very thin and don't feel like they are going to last very long. They're not the sturdiest and I don't wear the for working out as much as being cozy around the house, because they just don't feel like they are up to it. Three stars because I like them as lounge pants but had hoped for slightly better quality!"
3.0,Dress was ok but fit extremely small.
3.0,"Nice and thin ,but the side had visible scratches(possibly from a vise)."
3.0,I bought this to replace a cross I thought I had lost. It was a little thicker than my other one but it fit the requirement. Then I went to take it off and good thing my sink drain was closed because the cross came untied from the roping- now I‚Äôm concerned that I will lose this one as well.
3.0,"Decent chains. A few of mine came broken which isn't a huge deal, more of just an annoyance that I have to go and fix brand new chains. Also they are covered in an oily residue that smells really bad so I also have to clean them. Again, not a huge deal, but annoying."
3.0,"Ordered this for someone that normally wears a medium and ordered a large so it will be loose, but not sure it is even going to be big enough for them to wear at all."
3.0,It‚Äôs runs small. Buy a size larger.
3.0,will see how they hold up - my grandson seems to be hard on shoes
3.0,"Comfortable, but runs super big! I won't even wear it, it's that big"
3.0,"Received as gift. Recipient loves the fit and style, but it arrived with a snag in the fabric...disappointing. Fabric also seems a bit thin."
3.0,"They‚Äôre the right size but not nearly as pink as the picture. And since that‚Äôs what I bought them for in the first place, I‚Äôm kinda bummed out. Still cute for the price so I‚Äôll find things to wear them with."
3.0,Pretty cute but bigger than I expected - my fault.  Also too heavy for me to wear.  However I am keeping them and will gift them to someone.
3.0,"5‚Äô2‚Äù 130lbs, usually between a small and a medium (6-8 US sizes). After reading some reviews I ordered a medium. The skirt is slightly large, but not so much that i‚Äôll Send it back. It is a bit longer than expected too; goes almost to my knees. If you have shorter legs, expect it to be that long. I can hem it up an inch and it will be fine, but others may not have that ability."
3.0,The necklace is nicely made for the low cost.
3.0,I wore this during a moderate cycling workout on my indoor bike. After 20 minutes it did not take in any sweat and it was as if I did not wear a headband at all. Not recommended if you want to use it for cooling as well as preventing from having sweat run into your eyes.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt last long kept falling off
3.0,The mask itself is pretty thin compared to the picture. I probably would have chosen something different.
3.0,Very pretty just very heavy!  It kinda hurts my bellybutton if I wear it very long.
3.0,"This is a fun costume, and it mostly works. The one issue I have is that the fan to keep it inflated is right neat the top to the costume, which is at your waist. The fan blows right at your left buttcheek, and you kind of have to hold it away from you to get the costume to inflate. Once well-inflated, it mostly stays inflated, but a better positioned fan would help out.<br /><br />I do like that the fan can be powered by a power bank, as well as the included battery pack."
3.0,I thought I would be swearing more than I do if I dont do a high activity then Im barely see sweat like on a normal walk.
3.0,Cute but falling apart already.
3.0,Cute dress way too small
3.0,"I was hoping for a mix of metals and colors but received just a few colors and very similar metals. All are pastels. The pink, mint, yellow and peach are all on gold. All of the light blue are on silver. I was hoping for more of the colors shown in the photo and with not all of them having the exact same metal tone. Guess I‚Äôll keep looking."
3.0,The material is poor quality and I can already tell that when I wash it it‚Äôs going to fall apart pretty quickly.
3.0,"The band is more ""sparkly"" in real life than in the photo. That might be great if you are a teenage girl but I have not been a teenager for &lt;mumble-mumble> years now. That said, the band itself seems to be well made. It attaches easily to the Fitbit and it can be adjusted for a perfect fit.<br /><br />One note on changing bands: The band comes out easily when you press the peg, but getting another in is a little tricky until you have done it a few times. You need to put the band in at an angle. To better understand, do a search for videos on changing a Versa band. There are several out there that show you better than I can explain it."
3.0,"First one I ordered the chain broke, sent it back and now the pendant looks weird. Pale and fake stained looking. Disappointed."
3.0,I ordered a 4x I like them bigger they send me a med. Had to send it back but my husband is buying another one for meüòÅ
3.0,Size up for an oversize fit. Love the color and light weight feel.
3.0,Did not like the way the strings feel on my back.
3.0,"Nice looking watch, great product! For those that don't realize this watch needs to be wound up every few days, just a few twists an good to go! Would Definitely recommend this watch to all"
3.0,"Flimsy, cheap feel"
3.0,Pretty cheap looking and took over a month to arrive.
3.0,"This shirt has nice colors, quality fabric, but is very long."
3.0,They fit a little tight and also thought they would be longer looking at the picture.... They're not... Very short.
3.0,The clip that you have to unscrew and screw will eventually get loose and you will loose your key trust me but the other clip works perfect just be cautious
3.0,Cute and comfy. Definitely seems more like a size small rather than the size large I bought.
3.0,If you are a  diabetic these sock might not be for you! And if you have poor sercklation! Good blood sercklation is what makes this work!
3.0,"I ordered the medium because it said to order your normal size.  Don't!  It was uncomfortably small.  Terrible sizing advice from the seller.  The skirt waist measured the 12"" they promised, but there was not enough stretch in it.  Now I have to pay for return shipping.  I am super disappointed with the fit.  Everything else was nice; fabric, color, style were as expected.  Get your act together, seller, and give us good information."
3.0,"The clasps broke not even a week of having this bag. The bag itself is sturdy, and very cute. The chain seems to be good, but not long enough to wear as a crossbody. Replaced the lobster clasps with sturdier clips and the bag is much better now."
3.0,Good quality and nice colors to match any outfit.
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt fit wide arms very well and I find the inside flap always gets in my way.
3.0,Smaller than I expected. Had a difficult time trying to get the picture inserted.
3.0,"I'm 6'1&quot; 180lbs I wear a 7.25 fitted hat. The band fits well but there is way to much excess beanie on the top of the hat. I can pull the hat down past my eyes so I cannot see and although I only tested this for about an hour I can see that this won't be great for snowboarding, jogging or other physical activities.<br /><br />The sound quality is kinda cheap but it gets the job done and it loud and clear for the most part. The low end of the frequency distorts a bit but the high end is decent.<br /><br />I'm thinking about pulling the device out of the hat and putting it in another hat. I'd say overall for the money it's an ok buy. I will get my use from it."
3.0,"I loved it , it's just too thick."
3.0,its not that it wasnt cool but the one i got was not what i had ordered which is the one pictured here
3.0,"These are cute, but a little large in the waste area"
3.0,Burgundy color not as expected. It is VERY red in person. Like I opened the package and got smacked in the eyeballs by the color red. I really like the fit of it though.
3.0,The top is big for a size 10 and the bottoms are fine
3.0,"Great looking watch, good feel, but the clasp design is such that when you bend your hand / wrist towards your elbow it presses on the clasp and the watch opens.<br />Big design flaw for an active guy / someone who drinks and loses their nice things"
3.0,"I love the idea of these socks, they‚Äôre perfect for slip on shoes, but they are inconsistent on sizing and overall could be a bit bigger."
3.0,"Metal, but much smaller than I had anticipated. Not sure how useful these will be as the entry holes are too small for the cord I was planning to use."
3.0,This closes really easy until I put it in my ear and try to close it. I tried so many times that my ear is sore. I finally gave up. I guess this jewelry isn‚Äôt for single people who don‚Äôt have someone to put it in for them. Its cute though. Wish I could wear it.
3.0,Strap in comfortable but the sole is not thick enough to absorb running and long walks.
3.0,"Good, comfortable product."
3.0,Wristlet strap broke quickly.
3.0,"Good quality, but very very small."
3.0,it was smaller than its picture
3.0,The costume is hysterical and yet confusing. There is no way for an individual inside the costume to breathe. There are no air vents and would be difficult for someone with claustrophobia. Also it was impossible to figure out how to wear the costume because where the head was supposed to be was a tiny rectangular flap. I had to cut the flap off to make room for my head to have visual through the clear plastic opening.
3.0,Smaller than you think it is.
3.0,Were not tight enough to meet my needs.
3.0,My teenager loved it. She has had it for a few weeks now and it still looks.<br />UPDATE: It split in  half after 3.5 months of use.
3.0,"Nice fabric and seems really comfy but it fit me like a tent! Maybe it would have worked with a belt? But even then, didn't want to try that. I'm 5'6 and 145 and I have some curves and this just fit me horribly."
3.0,"Good price and light weight and keep the foot warm, but a little discomfort to wear all day, since it is too tight and narrow in the shoe front part. I would suggested get a size bigger to feel comfortable."
3.0,They work on my glasses with fat plastic temples but not on my pair with thin wire temples . Better for holding glasses on your face than for hanging them around your neck
3.0,The size was way off<br />I ordered for my 4 year old grandson and the shirt would have fit a much older child<br />Octonauts is a toddler type program not really for older Preteen children
3.0,came in on time and pretty good quality but not recommended for taller people and the neck closer/ hood felt a bit small for faces
3.0,good quality but sleeves run small - i think it is cut for junior sizing
3.0,The shirt is great. I would order from them again
3.0,This is also to small will return and see if u have larger
3.0,the grey ones i wanted were way to short. the black were the right size
3.0,Nice size. Quality not so good. Some pit holes and dark marks. Ok If you plan on painting it a solid color.
3.0,The mediums look a little small. My daughter is 5'3'' and 130lbs.  and it's a smudge small.
3.0,Nice but runs small. Returned.
3.0,Too big. Fits larger . Go at least one to two sizes down
3.0,Super cute! But a lot of writing on a very small keychain. The person I gave it to couldn‚Äôt even read it
3.0,"Yes, they work as a watch band, but are much 'fussier' to put on. The material feels 'lighter' than the other off brands. Considering buying some others as don't think much of these."
3.0,if you're tall and skinny this size will rise on you in the lower leg area. go w/ a smaller size...trust me you'll have space in the waist stillüòâ
3.0,The material is great however the fit is odd....I didn‚Äôt like it at all.
3.0,"This dress looked just like it does in the pictures, unfortunately it just didn't look right on me because my shoulders are on the wide side. Super cute otherwise!"
3.0,"The gloves look fine, but the size is misleading.  I have a very small hand.  I ordered a medium size and I could barely get my hand into the glove.  I think the size should be reviewed."
3.0,It looked better in pictures than the real thing. It is really thin. Not exactly what I expected but it is pretty and will work for spring weather.
3.0,"So cheap and plasticky, but you're getting what you're paying for.  Mirror lens scratches easily and screws become loose quickly, but again.  So cheap.  More cost-effective than buying one pair of expensive glasses that is still likely to break."
3.0,Good product for the price. Longer than expected shipping time which effected my rating no problem w the quality for the $.
3.0,"Bought my size, they fit as expected but there was no tummy control or smoothing at all."
3.0,"This camo women's super slim long sleeve shirt, fits very small. I understand that it's as slim shirt, but I got a XL and it fits more like a medium.  My 13 year old daughter could barely wear it.  So it's her's now.  It's made of breathable and comfortable material so it's comfortable to wear all day long."
3.0,"Although I do like this scarf the colors are not true to the picture. There's no blue/mint in the scarf, it's white, black, & gray. I wanted it for the pop of color which unfortunately isn't present in the scarf that was delivered to me."
3.0,"Arrived as promised.  I was so excited to receive this sweater however, the lace around the neck is itchy and it's very sheer. I returned it."
3.0,Ordered these for my husband.  He runs most every day.  He said they were ok but probably would not buy again.
3.0,Almost too small to be of much use.
3.0,I love all the pockets and the material but the waist is very tight.
3.0,"I like this bonnet, thought it would be a good idea to try to prevent split ends. If you have very smooth and fine hair like me, you're better off getting a silk pillowcase instead. slides right off my head as I toss and turn"
3.0,"Puesto parec√≠a una embarazada,mucho frunce con la goma."
3.0,"I new this was a unisex watch, put it is just not flattering on me at all.. I will continue to wear it because I need a black watch."
3.0,"This is not what what I expected for $32. It‚Äôs fine for a casual, day at the beach dress but it‚Äôs not as dressy as I was looking for. I thought I‚Äôd be receiving more of a mustard or golden yellow but it is YELLOW, yellow. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered a size down. It still fits very big. Disappointed with this purchase."
3.0,I wanted to love these pants but the cuff on the bottom is huge.  Looks all wrong.
3.0,"Smaller than anticipated, kid of cheap looking"
3.0,"These are really nice. Sleeves fit a little looser than I would prefer. Based on other reviews, I ordered a 3x since I am usually a 14. I ordered it planning to wear it with leggings and it was still just a little too big. These hold up better if you hang them to dry."
3.0,stone fell off first day but really fast delivery
3.0,It seems to be fully polyester and it makes me sweat at the waist band. It is really shiny fabric.
3.0,I bought this as a gift I have not yet given. It arrived encased in a plastic bag which I have not opened. From what I can see it looks very nice and as it has an adjustable strap I trust it will fit.<br /><br />I am writing this 'review' because it's been requested twice.
3.0,Grandson said they werent comfortable
3.0,great vision!!
3.0,Runs really small.. the bottom of the top is just cut all the way around without any stitching. Looks really cheap!
3.0,The legs on these are not straight but tapered. I normally wear a 4 but ordered 6 and it fits fine. I put them through washer and dryer. Good news was that it didn't shrink. Not so good news was that the fabric is now stiff and completely lost the initial softness when it first came out of the bag. The main thing that turns me off from buying another one is that the button above zipper felt flimsy and doesn't seem like it'll last long.
3.0,The color is disappointing.  I was expecting and blue with white or ivory large flowers and what I received is a blue with deep gold flowers.  The fabric is a large weave.  I will use it but it definitely does not look as good as the photo.
3.0,"It‚Äôs just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù to me now. At first I was excited to have this cheaper version of a Fj√§llr√§ven K√•nken kind of bag. I needed something that would be nice for daily doings with my kid, like a diaper bag kind of thing for a small child, whatever that would be.<br /><br />It‚Äôs very thin material, stitches seem to want to come undone as there is some thread coming out here and there. I usually have the top straps snapped together because if I don‚Äôt it just flops back and sticks way out (see picture). I noticed the K√•nken bags have nice stiff straps that stay straight up.<br /><br />It does hold things nicely, I take it to the library when I go with my son. There is plenty of room for a few books plus our belongings."
3.0,"They are warm, I'll give them that, but the quality seems to show itself when holes started to appear at the tips of my fingers. My hands aren't huge or anything either... so i'm not stretching these things out.<br /><br />Also this store ships from China, something I wasn't aware of initially... worth noting though."
3.0,Larger than anticipated. I can't understand why it even has a wristlet strap.  This bag is large enough to hold an i-Pad.
3.0,I would give this product four stars if one of the pairs hadn't been chipped and unusable.... I contacted the company and they seemed pretty nice and easy to work with but unfortunatly my plugs were shipped through amazon and I really dont know how to contact amazon and it would cost more than the plug is worth to return it for a new one so I gave up. Other than that they are pretty nice.
3.0,They work but look uncomfortably right on my kids sausage feet
3.0,Seams came apart on first wearing.
3.0,"The Dress, it is beautiful, however i didn't not appreciate how it came unpackaged in just a clear zippered bag."
3.0,"Seller would be wise to indicate size of bracelet in description.  It is 4 inches from end to end including clasp.  I purchased two, for two cousins being baptized together.  One girl is 4.5 months old and small for her age.  This bracelet will fit her. The other girl is 10 months old and is a bit above average for her age. This bracelet will not fit her, not even close, so I am returning it.  I would have given the bracelet another star because it is cute (although not spectacular), but Amazon now charges return shipping on items that don't fit, which they deduct from your refund, so the cost of this return adds another 20% (unless, I suppose, you're a Prime member)."
3.0,This looks gorgeous on the model! It is somewhat sheer and you need a slip. It also fits tightly in the bust and seems to accentuate that area. The fabric feels cheap.
3.0,Regular calidad
3.0,Fit was as expected. I'm 5'2&#34; 128 lbs and a small fit well. They're very soft whereas I prefer more spandex! I should have read the description/material. They're ok to wear on the weekend. I don't think they'll hold up for working out or running.
3.0,This is very cheaply made but you get what you pay for.
3.0,Okay fit for a small crossbody
3.0,Its like a tshirt material with plenty of stretch. Maybe a different color won't be as see through.
3.0,Shrunk after one wash. I would go a size up. Dress was cute and got a few compliments. I loved the jean like material.
3.0,I wouldn't recommend this if you have a long torso. Not made for tall women. Very nice pattern and material.
3.0,"Basically as described but a lot smaller than expected, i have very small hands and they are tight on my hands. The cuffs are very long and since they are smaller than expected, this makes it uncomfortable on the wrist."
3.0,Beautiful dress but it runs REALLY REALLY small.
3.0,Didn't care for the material the dress was made of and the fit was a bit snug and uncomfortable...though I went a size up to avoid it being too tight
3.0,Cute but SO HARD TO GET UNDONE.
3.0,"Ordered XL for 13 yr old daughter<br />She was devastated she couldn't get over booty.<br />She wears women's XL, size 16-18 and is 5'8&#34;.<br />I kept it bcuz my 12 yr old granddaughter might like it and can grow into it.<br />If not, it goes into community  swimsuit baskets that we store suits and due to kids all the time who are playing with triplets and they don't bring their swimsuits can swim (pool inside)"
3.0,The dress is see through.
3.0,"The fact that the backstrap is fixed and cannot be unfastened makes for a subpar fit especially since the curving lip on the heel, which is unnecessary to begin with makes it difficult to slip into these otherwise well-designed sandals."
3.0,"the pants runs small on waist size, also the pants meterial could be better they are just fine."
3.0,I ordered a large based on the reviews... Probably could've gone with a medium. I'm 135lb and 5'9&#34;. The back is very sheer and it's kind of awkward to wear a tank underneath since the front has a built in tank. Would be nice if the built in tank was a full tank and not just the front. I've still worn it and the yellow color is beautiful.
3.0,Great quality but way too small.
3.0,"The only thing that disappointed me was the feathers were all bent and matted together. I'll try,<br />when I get to it, to wet them down to see if they will look a little natural."
3.0,Def runs small and I am not a fan of the material but the style is nice and the print it cute.
3.0,Waaaaay to padded
3.0,The color is not as bright but cute
3.0,Nq
3.0,"My fault for not looking, but this fabric is not good for a shirt, super cheap more like a bathing suit"
3.0,Not bad just way too big
3.0,Not sweatshirt fabric which for San Antonio works fine. Very comfy but too big to wear this year. Got medium because small is usually too small.
3.0,The product is really nice and soft and I loved the colour and style but since I have to use for workout I was hoping it would feel more dry even after sweating like some other products do.
3.0,"They fit well, hold everything in place and comfortable, but if you sweat profusely like I do the the inserts are an issue. They don‚Äôt dry very quickly, in fact take hours to dry which is a big problem for me as I walk multiple dogs for long periods of time."
3.0,"For the money, it's pretty good quality. I liked that it had a clasp, but it's almost impossible to clasp it by yourself. It takes two hands. Very clumbsy."
3.0,Color was a bit gaudy for the material.
3.0,Igot this dress last mintues for an event. I couldn't wear it because it had a huge stain on the front of it.
3.0,"The large is huggs like a soft, well made body suite. I ordered the gray looking for a dark gray, but this is very light (picture against my dark gray swets for reference.) It is a good quality. Light weight but not see through. Nice style. Just not for me."
3.0,"Well, it's blue. And shiny. It's a decent size. Large enough, but not too big!!! It's just a bit too flashy/shiny for my taste. However, if you're a fan of big blue shiny things you'd like it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. The opinions are my own, and I was not compensated for my review."
3.0,Love them but the buttons fell off after the first time wearing them.
3.0,Nice Quality and pockets are great
3.0,This bra seems to run a little small which makes it very hard to take off.
3.0,Wish it were a tad bit bigger
3.0,Supposed to be a small amount of spandex in this dress I was looking for more of a cotton feel. They don't seem to have a cotton field more of a spandex feel
3.0,Not a good fit on me
3.0,Comfortable and light weight but easily after one workout several pulls
3.0,The color was not what I expected.  The grey was &#34;muddy&#34;  was hoping for a brighter grey.  The na<br />vy worked fine and I 'm wearing it for my grandson's wedding in June.  I plan to shorten it to tea leingth.
3.0,"Decent jacket, fitting was a bit smaller than expected, quality is decent."
3.0,The pants fit wierd. They were short in the legs and kept slipping down. I'm going to use them for pj pants.  I'm 250 and 5'7
3.0,It is smaller than I thought even though it shows the measurements and the lining already tore.  But it was nice while it lasted.
3.0,"These are cute, but they run small. They are tight on a size 7.5M US foot (38 European).  This means the seams at the toes are under pressure, so they get uncomfortable.  They would be better for a smaller foot."
3.0,"You definitely need to size up. I typically wear a medium or large depending on the brand, and I ordered a large. Had I known these would be as tightly fitting as they are, I probably would have gone up to an XL"
3.0,little big on my head
3.0,was nice to have on honeymoon not the greatest quality
3.0,It was gigantic on me and I ordered true to size. It had no shape and the material was not a coat... it was the material of a thick shirt.
3.0,Not really true to size
3.0,These earrings are really cute but unfortunately I cannot wear them. They are very small and unfortunately could not get them around my ear lobe enough to close them. I had my ears pierced years ago and these earrings did not work with the placement of my earring holes. These might be better to wear for a cartilage piercing on the ear.
3.0,"Way too small. Medium fits like an extra small and large fits like a small. We needed a medium. They are cute but run way too small. We really liked these and needed them for sports but after trying two sizes, we were quite disappointed."
3.0,Feather is not smooth.  It was O.K
3.0,Biggervthan expected
3.0,it's a bit tight maybe with time it will loosen up a bit.
3.0,"Cute, but a bit big!  I guess I expected the pumpkins to be a little smaller!  If you are purchasing these for younger girls, you may want to find something smaller."
3.0,The glasses are seriously adorable and look exactly like the picture. Sadly they are a little flimsy because they are made of plastic. Almost reminds me of a Halloween costume asscesory. It came quickly though and for the price I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I'm going to see tomorrow if it's possible to turn these into to perscription sunglasses. So we will see.
3.0,The quality of the boot is excellent. It is not for people like myself with wide feet. I would suggest a fitting chart to include width of a persons feet.  Had to return it.
3.0,"I liked the quality of the outside fabric and memory foam, but they run a size small."
3.0,Not long enough not a true Tunis length
3.0,"I'm VERY frustrated with this watch.  I like the watch a lot, don't get me wrong.  However, I received this watch on the first of December and the battery is already going.  It lasted 5 months.  I know I can't expect much when buying a watch this inexpensive, but I had hoped it would last at least a year.  I'm very disappointed."
3.0,"Material was oddly stiff and collar was way bigger than expected, made me feel like it was a women's shirt"
3.0,A LITTLE BULCKY
3.0,"Seems slightly thicker than 18g. Quite larger than expected overall, but still very pretty."
3.0,"The watch band should be larger, not everyone has a 7in wrist."
3.0,its nice but the straps are falling off and i always have to stitch them up but its big enough to fit all my school stuff
3.0,"This top is SUPER cute, however, it is way way way too small and is not actual size ...I ordered a women's 2xl and when it arrived, it was so small, I gave it to my 19 year old daughter who wears a small 5-7 in juniors and it fits her perfectly...she loves it !!! The pattern is beautiful and it came very fast after I ordered it but if I were to order it again, I would at the VERY least go to a size 5xl..I wear a 14 in women's but this top is not going to fit..I think it's chinese sizing"
3.0,"These can not be for a male adult. They look to be sized for a small child as they are very tight on my face. They are around an inch narrower than my current glasses. The optics seem ok, but I doubt I could wear these for any amount of time."
3.0,I wore this dress for a photoshoot. It looked great on!! The only thing is that it was very hard to put on. The dress did not go over my shoulders easy.
3.0,"Cute dress, picked the wrong size but still ok to wear."
3.0,buen producto para su precio
3.0,"This suit is flattering and does come in a cute ziplock bag. The bodice was a bit long for me, so it may run a bit large if you're short. The color is not accurate. It is not navy. It is black with turquoise dots."
3.0,"As others have mentioned the fit of these expensive masks is poor.  The bridge of the nose area is not bendable enough nor does it keep its' shape.  The mask tends to slip down on the nose even when the straps are kept very tight allowing exhaled air to pass upward into the eyes and to fog glasses.  As others have mentioned, the masks also shrink on washing making them too small."
3.0,look to be decent boots actual boot differs from pic slightly around the toe area.
3.0,I got this for my brother as a gag gift but it didn't turn out to really look like the mask at all. It was very wide and just looked goofy! But it was still a funny gift.
3.0,Material does not feel that good
3.0,"Not baggy enough, color too light, material too thin."
3.0,Exactly how it looks and fits great!
3.0,Size 2XL and 3XL is not US Medium.  It's good material but zipper are cheap quality.
3.0,"The color is beautiful, but it is more thin than I expected. You can see through it clearly when you hold it up. It's not suuuper expensive, but for the price I was expecting that it was a bit more thick. I'm worried that if it snagged, It would be torn through. The packaging was cute though and the size in nice. I don't think other similarly priced options would be better. I'd probably buy again if I were looking for a particular color. Just be aware when you're buying that it's transparent."
3.0,"I ordered the silver cap, 2.25"" inch tassels. I'm not sure how many I was supposed to get but I got 43, 3 colors of 3 tassels, which doesn't help with making earrings. These are super pretty and seem to made well."
3.0,"Nice quality, fits small."
3.0,It was too small in the chest of the dress and it too icky for my daughter.
3.0,Collar wasn't sharply tailored as expected
3.0,Had to return.  My boyfriend usually wears a Lrg and lives in fox shirts but this one was too small. Disappointed that they dont have it in xl now that I bought a matchimg hat!
3.0,Bad fit. Too large.
3.0,"The fabric feels good, no need to iron but it's not true to size like previous orders. Guess I should have ordered  in Large instead of Medium."
3.0,"Cute design, but it lost color very quickly. It‚Äôs discolored from only several weeks of wear. It snags very easy. It‚Äôs very thin and not durable enough for everyday wear."
3.0,"Nicely made, nice material and comfortable.  Only reason for 3 stars is that there is only 1 pocket!  I would prefer a few.  If it had more pockets, would be 5 stars."
3.0,"This seems like a nice polishing cloth, but I really don't notice much difference before and after."
3.0,"This dress is 97% Polyester! Keep that in mind if you are planning to wear this in the spring or summertime. Every time I stood up, I felt like the dress was stuck to the back of my legs.<br /><br />Not to mention, the gaping hole underneath the bow in the chest area forced me to need a tank top underneath (see other reviews for similar photos) which completely changed the look of the dress.<br /><br />I would be able to go out in public in this outfit if I needed to, but would not recommend it to anyone else due to the poor construction."
3.0,"The embroidery of the dog came with threads sticking out, and the material of the hat is very thin. But for the price, it's about as expected."
3.0,Made some what small
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and about 165. Purchased large and I‚Äôd try a medium.<br /><br />I‚Äôm usually a large in pj bottoms bc I‚Äôm curvy at the bottom but with a smaller waist but like to be comfy. This fits weird for my shape. The drawstring helps but it‚Äôs still an awkward fit for the bottoms. The top is really large and long<br />The material is not stretchy so for nursing I have to bring in one side before feeding on the other.
3.0,It fits good just tht I can't raise my arms. It tightens under the arms and back when I do tht.<br />I'm slightly muscular so tht may also be a reason for tht.  I think these shirts and sizes are for small slim guys. Not fat or tht of a muscular build.
3.0,Well done shirt... but it showed a week and a half late... so I had to give my mom this as a late mother's day present... and I paid extra to get it here early... but overall amazing shirt
3.0,They didn't fit shoes even by the measurements in the description.
3.0,"I like the purse in general because it has many pockets and you can hold many  things in there. The ID and credit card slots are a great asset as well.  However, the smell is horrific.  I wore it to church and everyone including myself felt as though it had a fishy smell.  I smelled it straight from the package but hoped after a few days the smell would dissipate...it didn't."
3.0,Can‚Äôt see much through it but can‚Äôt wait for the witnesses to describe what they saw on the news in my area
3.0,"If you like elephants, this one's for you.  So cute.  I had a terrible time trying to hook the clasp, so I tried to slip it over my hand<br />and one of the links let go and the bracelet went flying, but it was easy to repair myself.  If I can finally get it hooked, I'd be very<br />happy to wear it."
3.0,not as great of quality as I expected.
3.0,I feel for the price it just feels weak.  Worried it could break/rip.
3.0,It‚Äôs cute. Not as nice as pictured.
3.0,Wore it a few times and the heart in the middle is faded off and the silver has faded off the ring
3.0,I like the feel of them. I feel like they should come in different sizes since they were quite small for my breast size. I don't understand how you're supposed to keep them in place. There's no sticky adhesive to keep them stuck to your boob. I bought some tape to keep them in place. Well because of the substance that these are made out of the whole outside lining of the gel inserts came off with the sticky adhesive and started to just fall apart and chunks so now I have chunks of gel clumps.
3.0,The shirts are nice fit well but have a bad smell to them.
3.0,it's kinda heavy not as light and airy I was expecting.  and it runs big.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:12b8ae5ad1e5e6cccf2bec97035506ff]] My package was late and then on top of that it‚Äôs ripped at the zipper
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, however it is see through even with nude body suit.  Normally a sz M but got a large after reviews because of my boob size.  The large was too big, slit was a little too high, but still a very comfy material and like I said, pretty dress."
3.0,I gave 3 stars because you cannot adjust the straps.  Nice red color.
3.0,"This mask was a bit big for my head/face, and had super limited visibility. I might use it for other things, but it was not an appropriate accessory for leaving the house/Halloween costuming for me due to mask falling down and obscured vision."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress but it was a little weird.<br />The top fit was super cute and totally comfortable! On the bottom, the right side is longer than the left side, but just slightly so it looks like it‚Äôs sewn off  centered and it probably shouldn‚Äôt have pockets bc they bulge out and make you look wide at the hips.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, fit-athletic build and ordered a size medium.<br />I would have kept it if the pockets weren‚Äôt bulgy and I wish the length was the same around the bottom."
3.0,"I know it's supposed to be off the shoulder and slouch, but it falls off my body basically.  still cute with a belt."
3.0,I just felt &#34;ok&#34; about these sunglasses. They were too big for my face and I returned them. They felt well-made though!
3.0,"This box really looks nice. However, I did not note the published size if it was shown. Therefore, I expected the box to be larger than it actually is. That is my only complaint. Please note: It is really a nice box."
3.0,Looked ok but fit a little tight
3.0,"I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 120 lbs,  and Amazon suggested I would wear a size M so I bought a medium but I am sending it back as it is extremely large. To me it feels like an XL. It is soft and comfortable but the length hit my knees. lol. The neck opening also strangely large opening and the neck strings were weirdly long."
3.0,Nice fit but the material is a bit too thin.  I would wear a body suit underneath.
3.0,I ordered size 24 but I need a 23.
3.0,I had to buy feathers to fix it so that I looked presentable. I wouldn't suggest unless you plan on spending more money for feathers to fix it.
3.0,"This dress is very nice, the material feels very soft and it fit me really well. Honestly it would have gotten 5 Stars had it not been for the fact that they sewed the side of the dress to the second button. I went ahead and unstitched it now I have to go back and sew the second button back on. So that was a bit disappointing. I ordered a Small, I'm 5'5&#34; and 145 lb"
3.0,"A fine wallet, good construction, but must agree with other reviewers -- it arrives with a very unpleasant smell. I've had mine for two weeks now, and the odor is still very noticeable. I will not be purchasing another product from this line, for that reason."
3.0,"Cute, but it came with pieces of tiny metal sticking out hurting me. I had to sit and pull them all out."
3.0,A little bit too small.
3.0,Didn't like material and fit
3.0,Too short for 12 yr old. Material very soft.
3.0,They won't remain intact if it's not  wash by hand. It shrink in the  washer.
3.0,"The necklace is cute. but its super long.  I guess I should have expected that, but here is a heads up for you!"
3.0,"The Zipper was broke when I got it. I cannot close it. Overall I like the purse. You think it‚Äôs leather online. It looks like leather, but it‚Äôs not. That doesn‚Äôt bother me."
3.0,Very narrow and long.
3.0,"This wasn't for me, I know it was a ""hot"" item but I found my jewelry getting stuck on it and my bag would get attached to it.  In addition the strings were way too long and looked odd IMO."
3.0,"Wish I can have it bigger. Love it, but too small. So not a standard side (I am side 6)"
3.0,Broke after 2 weeks x.x
3.0,Cute design but not enough room for my butt and I'm normal build
3.0,"Sadly, the fabric is more ‚Äúyarn-like‚Äù than a soft material. That and the fact that the colors are not muted at all and there‚Äôs a very bright sea foam stripe that I didn‚Äôt expect."
3.0,The image led me to believe it was a wrap style of sunglasses even though it didn‚Äôt state wrap. The product I received is more square & flat in nature.<br />Neg.  This allows light to come from the sides causing issues.<br />Pos. They are light as described and comfortable to wear.
3.0,These aren't the best but also aren't the worst. Good value for the price. Fit as expected...but the legs kept riding up most of the day. I annoyingly had to adjust them throughout the day.
3.0,"I am a 38D.  On me, this shirt made me look like my mom.  Stay away from it if your are large chested it will just over emphasize that. Refund was super easy though.  If you are younger, skinnier and smaller chested I bet you'd look awesome in it!"
3.0,"These just did not fit the way my other Alegrias (Palomas) did, so I sent them back.  They were cute."
3.0,"Pretty thick, hard to breathe through"
3.0,Nice material but it is tighter than I hoped it would be since I went up 2 sizes.
3.0,"This item runs SMALL  I ware a medium usually, but ordered a large as it is a cotton T. SO tight before was :(  The T is what i wanted and expected otherwise, but i have to return"
3.0,These are very beautiful. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because they were actually bigger and heavier than I needed. But I will find a use for them.
3.0,My kid hates how tight it is and she gets stuck in it when trying to get it off. I'd suggest sizing up.
3.0,Very Small But Ok..
3.0,"It was a nice product, but was larger than expected. Gave it to my granddaughter to clip on her backpack. Other than size, I did like it."
3.0,"Good leather actually. Cheap sole. Fit is a little small, go half size bigger. They look good. I needed to only wear a boot while performing a specific aspect of my job, so I didn't need $200.00 boots. In summary, if you need high quality boots, these are not them. If you need a boot once in awhile for yard work or to clean out your garage these are fine."
3.0,Some of the graphic on the shoe was missing. But comes from China so sending back and getting another pair would take weeks.
3.0,"The bag is smaller than I hoped.  Made a few adjustments for security reasons, i.e., took the tassel off since it was attached the the zipper that opened the purse; replaced the standard &#34;single&#34; handle, since the latch holding the handle to the purse snaps off easily...if a robber ran by and grabbed my purse, they would be able to steal my purse with ease...I'm now using the over the shoulder strap (much more secure), which was included with purchase.  Otherwise, not a bad purchase, just need a bigger hobo bag to suit my needs."
3.0,Cute and soft material.
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt so bad
3.0,This thing is almost sheer! And buy one size up for arm room.
3.0,It cleaned most of the shoes except for 2 black marks on my zebra‚Äôs but if you ask me its no different from just water and dish soap. Oxi clean cleans better than this. Not to mention the annoying bubble gum smell it left on my shoes. Dont waste your money just buy some oxi clean it works better.
3.0,Cute idea but very cheaply made.
3.0,"Fit good but smelled horrible, I have to take it to the cleaners."
3.0,I bought 2 sizes up because of the other reviews I read. I normally wear a medium I bought an extra large and it fits great. I was disappointed that it says dry clean recommended. I normally buy clothes that I can throw in the wash. But overall very pleased.
3.0,"the nose cuff extends pretty long up your nose and the one I put on really good had fell out but still cute, I guess its just not for me."
3.0,"The material looks very cheap. I got 2x and I usually wear an XL and it swallowed me, people recommend going down on size i would go 1-2 sizes down. Its is very comfortable."
3.0,Thought it was gray and black but now i got it is black and white was disappointed anyways nice.
3.0,"It is pretty and when I first put it on, I love it. But then if I move at all, it gets all twisted up and it shortens up the strands and feels like it is choking me."
3.0,Bra top too large and no way to tighten it. Pants fit well at waist and abdomen but legs too tight.
3.0,They don't stay up. Nothing on the waist to help keep them from rolling either. I may use them to sleep in but all day wear is a hard pass. I have lipedema and they just don't compress enough to stay up.
3.0,I love the material but the shirt and pants run small.
3.0,The sleeves and torso were way shorter than expected.
3.0,"Pretty shirt but the Elastic in the sleeves started to let loose, and now there are little elastic ‚Äústrings‚Äù hanging off everywhere all over on the sleeves . Only wore for about 4 nights of work , and never put in the dryer, only hand washed /hung to dry.<br />The front is sheer and you can pull the string in middle to reveal more chest if you want or not- but that area (the bust) material is also very small- and didn‚Äôt even fully cover my bust (I‚Äôm only a 36 B), and I got a size L.<br /><br />Would be beautiful for a one time wear, but be aware, that if you‚Äôre large chested, order a size UP from your normal size. The sleeves are also a bit tight and constricting."
3.0,I can rate the fitting since I was sent a Small. I did not like the material. I thought it would be heavier.
3.0,"This purse looked so perfect for my needs, and probably would have been if both inside zippers wasn't broke. I never even tried to use or fix, just wrapped it back up and shipped back.  The rest of the purse was as pictured."
3.0,Not a big hat person. There is nothing wrong with it just not sure it's for me. Not sure if it will stay on while driving my convertible or on the boat.
3.0,I personally loved this shirt. I would serious recommend it. The lace is a bit too large
3.0,Thinner than I expected.
3.0,"This is so cute but very big, and I‚Äôm 6 months pregnant. Cute style tho"
3.0,"First of all, thanks to those advising to order a size smaller than normal; I did and the fit is close to perfect and tan color near impossible to find in alternative products. However, as mentioned by some reviewers. the material is much lighter than sweat pants; closer to the weight of pajama bottoms. The result is somewhat &#34;revealing&#34; and I would not wear in public...however, for around the house, they are fine (but don't turn down the heat too much!)."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f004d8174aad21cddb55762d2e058afd]] In general ok, but not that thickness"
3.0,"Look pretty cool at first but the gold on the dragons starts coming off in a few days, and I‚Äôve had two of the bracelets break already"
3.0,"Good price but a little flimsy when the wind blew hard. Also, make sure to really let it dry out before you close it or it will rust."
3.0,"Worked ok for a while, then after less than a year dead.  When they did work they would occasionally cut out with my phone in a pouch at my waist.  Sound was ok/ what I would expect for inexpensive earbuds."
3.0,This does not sit on my head as expected. The horns are not movable. They end up sitting directly on top instead of near the temple.
3.0,I like the product but one pair was missing a nose piece
3.0,"Based on the pictures, I expected a loose, flows, lightweight shirt. This is a thicker material and like workout clothing. I'm only keeping it because returning would be a pain."
3.0,"They were very cute and soft. My daughter loved them, but after wearing them for a week, the stitching came out of the strap. I'm returning."
3.0,"A little cheaper made than i expected, but cute."
3.0,This was a very cute tshirt but too thin for me.  Could almost see right thru it.  The design was nice and it fit true to size.  I wish it was thicker material.
3.0,"The size is perfect. Comfortable, but give it 3 stars for the price. Look at a store for less money. 28 dollars. But it had orderered<br />New review: doesn't stay up well as a strapless and doesn't have much push up at all. I'm in all my brass 40b and the cup are too big and doesn't support."
3.0,Super baggy and thin material. I expected material to be slightly thicker than what showed up. Length was ok. I did end up returning them due to fit as a smaller pair wouldn‚Äôt have been long enough
3.0,The dress fit snugly. I was able to put on without a bra (DDD) which is rare. However the waist on the wrap was absolutely too small. I bought a size 12 and the wrap waist was more for a size 4.
3.0,I ordered those twice over a course of two or three years.  And the screw on the end pieces/hinge  keeps getting loose and tries to pop out.  I have to screw it back in continually but it won't hold.  The temple on the right side tend to go loose.  For all of my eyeglasses from this product and supplier.<br /><br />Those are nice glasses and the lens quality is good even it they are plastic.  But I am very annoyed having to screw back in the screws and also from having lost them and the temples totally separate.  I sadly will move on and order a different product from another supplier.
3.0,The material seems very nice and the color is beautiful. Can't say much more than that as I ordered a medium and received a small. I'm giving it to my 13yr old and will try this again.
3.0,The finish is nice and the engraving is nice but the face of the watch has a cheap look to it.
3.0,The body of the jacket fits fine but the arms are slimmer than they should be compared to the rest of the jacket.
3.0,It cute but smaller than I thought the pearl j got was cream and you can‚Äôt even see it so I‚Äôm a little bit upset
3.0,Cheap material but matches the price
3.0,"Very happy with the quality, but the color is totally different then photographed. I ordered the red and it is much darker then it appears on the listing. I would say it's closer to maroon versus bright red.  The hat is well knit, but overall it a 3 bc of the color."
3.0,Much smaller than expected across shoulders and in the front where the opening should meet.
3.0,The ring is cute but much smaller than expected. It is also pretty cheap looking and would not like to wear it as a promise ring. It was delivered on time and had great service. It also comes in a nice box. I will be returning this item.
3.0,It said that it runs small but that is incorrect it actually runs a little big I would recommend ordering a size smaller
3.0,it is very sexy and nice
3.0,There was makeup stains on the dress when I got it. I gave a 3 star since the makeup. But the dress was too dressy for the occasion. Will be returning.
3.0,Lace at bust was sewn crooked.  But very pretty dress.  I am 5'7 and old school...meaning it was a little to short to wear to church.
3.0,My daughter is 13 and wears a 14 slim usually and most brands are big. These fit more like a 10 or smaller.
3.0,As you can see in the pictures you have to lay the collar down in order for it to look decent. If you try and have it up it just looks super weird. I‚Äôm not sure if my husband will wear this in public but at least he will be nice and warm at home!
3.0,"I bought an extra Large thinking would be roomie.  It is tight, fits more like a medium."
3.0,"Love the shirt but not purple as shown in picture, more maroon/red.  Will buy again in different colors."
3.0,The paint is already chipping off and only had the keychain for about 3 days. Could‚Äôve been better for the price
3.0,"The product is dandy. The folks at Amazon apparently think the TWO hats I purchased should be bent, folded, spindled and crammed into the smallest box possible to minimize their 'Prime' benefit cost at the cost of the product itself. Neither of the brims is ever going to be correct (180 degree bends in brim wires never fully come out) and the massive dimple in the front of the crest still has not relaxed out of my sons hat. It's my mistake though. The Grimm web store was the same price, but charged shipping....now I know why."
3.0,"For the price, it did it‚Äôs job. I would only recommend it to someone who will use it solely for traveling. I first used it in March 2017 for a trip and just had my passport, ID and credit card‚Äî just what I needed.  When we came back, I never switched wallets back and this became my everyday wallet. By August the seams started ripping and by the end of October it was completely thrashed. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again, but I‚Äôm not sorry that I bought it."
3.0,It‚Äôs ok the zipper is kind of uncomfortable.
3.0,It fit perfect in the top but the legs were more like capri style on me. I ordered a medium and I am 5'6&#34; with a medium chest. I will be sending back to try a large.
3.0,I usually wear small but ordered medium and its a good thing because they are very snug.
3.0,The zipper part is kind of ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and the whole area right there is baggy looking almost. They fit great on the butt and legs though!! And the length is great with boots
3.0,I thought these would be thicker. They are super thin. I usually wear two on each foot to add thickness.
3.0,"Love the fit, love the feel, love the color BUT wash before you wear! The dye tends to bleed on to skin and my armpits were pink for a few days. üò•"
3.0,I got a size up and it doesn‚Äôt stretch and it was way too tight in the chest. Cute pattern though.
3.0,"definately warm- I had to wear heavy socks, somewhat larger than I expected. Nice look-appears well constructed.-"
3.0,The first one I got tore after 3 days. Replacement is holding up well.  Like the designs. Comfortable to wear.
3.0,"They expect you to be short waisted and ginormous boobs apparently. It was off in size. The toros was small for me and the boobs were too big. But it seems to be a pretty flattering suit regardless. Worth the price but if I was bigger on the bottom, I don't think it would've fit."
3.0,I love the color. The fabric is super thin.
3.0,"These shoes were a reasonable price compared to most places. They did come with a sticker inside right on the designer name that was a pain to peel off and left some left over sticker and some small marks/scuffs on both shoes. I considered returning them, but most places were sold out before Christmas of this shoe in my size and I figured with suede they will probably get marked up anyway at some point. Fit true to size."
3.0,This product isn‚Äôt as soft as the Sherpa jackets in store. I actually refuse to wear it in public. The zipper is very cheap. It‚Äôs already broken.
3.0,Cute but fit was not great. Too small in body area but very large arm holes. Sent it back.
3.0,"Ordered a medium - for reference I‚Äôm typically a 6-8 so I knew that going up to a large wouldn‚Äôt be flattering on me. I am very curvy up top as a 36DDD and I have a bit of extra fat on my upper arms, so needless to say the top half of the dress is a little tight on me and didn‚Äôt quite have the desired effect. The red is a very nice color and is true as pictured and the skirt is definitely modest enough which is nice. I wore it a couple of times before I decided it just wasn‚Äôt working for me because of how uncomfortable and unflattering it is on top. If your chest is on the smaller side then I think it would be very cute, but if you‚Äôre busty on top or have wider arms then it‚Äôs not the most comfortable or flattering option."
3.0,Too big for me  the wine v<br />Colored oned.are jumigis
3.0,"Image painted on. Kinda cheap looking. But, for the price... it'll get you by. More like a display piece than for heavy use"
3.0,"I am quite pleased with this top. The size is perfect for me, not too clingy but nicely drapey. It feels comfortable and it looks attractive. I think it will wash easily too.<br />I purchased the scoop neck tunic and I feel it would be good for date nights with my husband and possibly for work with leggings.<br /><br />I had to change my 5 star review.  WARNING, wash before wearing. I did not and something in it severely irritated my skin and I broke out in a rash. It was only on the back of my neck so I'm suspecting the tag. Too late to return so I will do more checking and see if I can use the shirt. Also, the stitching on the wrist started coming out while wearing the first time."
3.0,Cute but color changes quickly
3.0,Larger than expected. Maybe a little more pricey than I'd like for the quality. Good costume accessory.
3.0,Tryna get info before purchasing
3.0,Slightly too big wish you had a smaller size
3.0,The dress was beautiful but sadly too small. My daughter is a true size 8 and the top was far too small!
3.0,"This shirt fit as expected and is a decent quality fabric. The graphic is cute, too. I‚Äôm returning it, however, because I‚Äôm concerned how long the design will last. The shirt came in a plastic bag and some of the lettering was sticking together (maybe it was pacakaged before the design was fully set?), resulting in an orange stain on some of the white lettering (see images). It‚Äôs not super noticeable but since other spots of the shirt seem to not have the design adhered the best, I‚Äôm doubtful the design would last very long."
3.0,I am a 42f size bra and I was looking for a comfort bra to wear around the home. I usually get 2x size for my lounge around sports bra but this one is not the typical sizing. I would size up 1-2 sizes. It is unfortunate the padding doesn't come out. As for someone with such large breasts padding doesn't look or fit right.
3.0,Strap broke but oftherwise it is just what I needed it fit my credit card drivers license passport and money with a little extra room to spare to fit my phone.
3.0,This fit my proportions but it didn't sit on my body well.  I was always trying to pull or tug it into place.
3.0,Sorry didn't work out
3.0,"It‚Äôs an ok top. I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs still way too big, but if you‚Äôre looking for an overly large top then this would be perfect. Not particularly my favorite."
3.0,Nice skirt but it runs too small. I weight 115 and the small did not fit so I had to return it and ordered medium instead.
3.0,Im 150 lbs and I could have used a small BUT the sleeves were too short for my liking. I ordered a medium. I wore a corset over it.
3.0,Shirts run very big.
3.0,I had to give it to my daughter because it was way too small.  I didn't like that it was very thin.  I bought it in the winter time but it is definitely a spring and maybe even a summer night type of deal. My daughter loves it!
3.0,"Tiny size aside, the backlight is a joke."
3.0,A bit cheap.
3.0,A bit too tight and the shape around the arms on the back is nothing like the picture
3.0,Product is okay. Goes up about two inches above the elbow which is fine but it doesn't stay up if I need to lower my arm. I don't have small arms so that's not the reason for the glove not staying up. Seems it does not have top support to keep the glove up.
3.0,"I was so excited to get these shoes for my son. However, when I got them they were not grey and black like pictured, they are sparkly metallic thread and black. Super frustrated they are not more clear about this in the description. But they fit well and he loves them so not worth a return."
3.0,I really like these pants however these are a little bit shorter than the other pairs that I purchased from you.  Why is that?
3.0,The angel wing rather large
3.0,"They are very comfortable and I like the way they look, but when the sun hits me as I drive they don't protect me."
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt happy my grandson bought these but it was for a joke. Like using a mouth piece in football. Heat water soften wax put in mouth yes and look like you have gold teeth.
3.0,"The price is right for a tie my fiance will only wear once.  The silk was somewhat cheap feeling, and color was not as vibrant as online (the compouter settings could be a factor, though).  Ok purchase."
3.0,Display need to be brighter.
3.0,Was not thick enough to be safe
3.0,The piece was nice but ran small
3.0,"I love, love WallFlower jeans. I have large calves and a small waist, and other styles of their jeans fit me very well. These on the other hand...not so much. The waist is just enough too large for me that they try to slide down all the time. I feel like I have to adjust and pull on them a lot. I do love the color of these jeans, and they fit well enough that I am going to keep them."
3.0,The stripes to not match at the seams. This results in a cheap appearance.
3.0,It is really cute but not really big. No place for bills. But still recommended it for a young adult.
3.0,"The pretty nice, and feel comfortable but it will hurt in the back of your ankle."
3.0,"I'm a perfectionist, so I may have rated &#34;harshly&#34; my only problems with this is the green coloring was thick on some and thinner on others, also on all of them (4) the green was on some of the metal off of the leaf, finally, one pin had a section of metal (the decorative wire stuff) missing, I guess from an error in the casting process, other than all that, I am extremely happy"
3.0,"The ears themselves are just fine.  Easy to hear with them on as well.  My only complaint was that when I opened the shipping box, the ears were not in their package, as if someone removed them from their packaging and then threw the ears and the opened package in the shipping box."
3.0,The fabric and style of the piece was fine for the price. What I was disappointed with is that I ordered the Navy color for a wedding and what I received was a very faded dark blue. Will not work at all for the intended purpose. Gave it to my daughter to wear for every day. Also very short in length which is ok for us because we are too.
3.0,Good quality stickers and a very bright colors. I was just unpleasantly surprised how small they were.
3.0,The elastic gives too much which means that eventually they won‚Äôt continue to fit the same because of the the insecurity of the elastic around the waist
3.0,Don't remember.
3.0,"They are cute, but the colors are a little to pale and they are very tiny."
3.0,"They fit my frames perfectly. Much better than the Revant replacements I had been using. The optical quality is okay. I think Revant had a slight edge in that area. The Revant lenses also had better polarization. The polarization on these are passable. The lenses are thicker than the Revant lenses, which is another point for Seek. I'll add to this later to see how these wear out compared to the Revants.<br /><br />EDIT: They were good for about 10 months before the wear on the lens became visually annoying. The finish on the lens isn't very hard. For the money, I'm happy enough with them. They're still better than the Revants I had before."
3.0,I really liked the look of these but two of them fell apart. They weren't expensive so I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Good for the price, but if u looking for a prayer shawl tht will wrap you all over, Please get a much bigger size"
3.0,Great quality headpiece was big! My daughter love it
3.0,Hard to operate when older.
3.0,"Love the dress and color and how soft it is, but this color is very sweet through, even with spanx or proper under garments."
3.0,It‚Äôs a little bigger than I expected but I was looking for a cardigan that had pockets and this was it. Great price!<br />BTW- It doesn‚Äôt shrink like most so that‚Äôs a plus.
3.0,I go the size based on the comments and the top portion was too large for me.
3.0,"I always have trouble looking for quality no-show socks that I don't have to continuously pull up and put back into place. These did that for me, but only for a couple of hours of wear on the first day. After about four hours I would have the same issues with them, namely that the silicon on the back would start curling outward and ultimately lose grip on my heel. I would try to wear them again after I washed them, but I would just have more of the same problems. I am a US shoe size 8.5, so perhaps they may be better suited for smaller feet. It is possible they have stretched out and ultimately would no longer fit my feet, but I am still disappointed these did not work out for me."
3.0,"This was purchased for someone with serious sensitivity to direct sunlight. It works very well, and seems to be quite well made. The problem is it was bought as a 5xl, and fits like a 1x or 2x at best. I myself wear a 2x and could barely fit in this. The product is great, but unfortunately the sizing is a major issue."
3.0,Cute suit but the butt shows my kid's crack.
3.0,I like all the different compartments. Wish it was smaller but I didn't pay enough attention to size.
3.0,Bought these hoping they would relieve the pressure off my heels from my plantar fasciitis. They felt a lot like how crocs fit. I need more of a heel. They didn‚Äôt help with my plantar fasciitis.
3.0,"Its okay, worn it a few times and realize that its a bit tighter than most, will set aside for someone else to enjoy."
3.0,Cute and the price was perfect!
3.0,"The hat and gloves were of decent quality. I ordered a small child‚Äôs size. The gloves were sized appropriately, but the hat was adult size."
3.0,Not enough support for my wife.
3.0,"Colors are wrong.<br />I received a sliver with pink stone, rather then black with red ruby."
3.0,"I‚Äôve been using this for a few weeks now, and the paint is starting to rub off of the rings and the middle part of the keychain. So now I see the brass and the steel used to make it. I‚Äôm not particularly impressed by how chintzy the paint job is, and I‚Äôd expect this thing to look nice for at least a year given how expensive it was."
3.0,This works for what it‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs great for the outside. Nice and warm too.
3.0,The size and style are great! But the top zipper broke .
3.0,"Although this swimsuit is Cute, the top doesn't cover like the main picture. Your chest will either be popping out the bottom like in the other pictures, or spilling out the top. The bottoms fit great. I'll be returning since this is not the look I was going for. If you're wanting to show some major under boob this is for you!"
3.0,The title says it all. Good quality but too small. I bought it for my son. He's half Russian. He loves it.
3.0,Material is very thin. No tag on the tshirt. Beware.....an XL fits like a medium
3.0,"The socks were listed as &#34;full crew&#34;, however, they are 1/2 crew.  Very short cuff. The cuff is a little higher than an ankle cuff but far shorter than a full crew.  I don't know if the ones delivered were sent in error or if this is their version of &#34;full crew&#34;.  We kept them since the nuisance or returning them wasn't worth the time and  effort. the actual foot length of the sock was good."
3.0,"I'm only 5 foot and this still came 4 inches from the floor when around my waist. It smelled which could just be a fluke thing and was very rough looking. It did add fluff to my dress, but just wasn't long enough and the strings to tie it around you were pretty short. Did arrive ahead of time though so that's good!"
3.0,"Much too large.  I wanted a normal necklace length.  (You asked for a bunch of words, but I had nothing more to say.)"
3.0,"Kinda cheap looking, but as described"
3.0,"I am a large in US sizes and my friend is a MEDIUM with a small ribcage, it didn't fit ME at all and barely fit her."
3.0,Expected these to be dull but they are shiny metal
3.0,When you squat you can see your under wear size large
3.0,"Not very comfortable at all hard insole, look nice from a far, but would not by again."
3.0,gorgeous to look at. becomes a little uncomfortable after a few hours of use.
3.0,The fabric pils really easily. It is nice and warm though!
3.0,This was not the product I ordered I ordered the fruit of the loom two pack cotton  boxers. The item I receive fits a little smaller than the other ones that I ordered. If they shrink when I wash them I am going to look to return them  because they will not fit if they shrink it all. Very disappointing that I did not get what I ordered.
3.0,"Not compression at all. I am 5'6"" 170 I ordered a medium not tight at all. Super soft and comfortable."
3.0,Purchased as a gag gift. Hilarious.
3.0,"Love the design and the color, the fabric is a little thin and there is no liner, which is unusual for a bathing suit. It was a little big for my toddler, but fingers crossed it will fit her next year."
3.0,Bib was very cute but extremely thin. Even one drop of milk or drool will definitely soak through which sucks. I guess its more just for show.
3.0,"Small in the chest (I am 34/32DD) with some side boob. I guess this is for low hanging breasts. The rest of my body fits pretty well (5'1, 119 pounds). Differently does not fits like the one in the picture.  I will keep it as it is tight and supports my breast. (Size M)"
3.0,"These pajamas appear to run a little shorter in the legs and this was after sizing up.  I bought these for my grandsons.  When I saw them on the boys last week, the color had already faded somewhat.  The pattern was very cute, but the wearing of the pjs were not as good as others purchased in the past."
3.0,"These shoes are great, u can wear therm 3 or 4 times and then they start looking used and worn out"
3.0,"I purchased this skirt because it paired perfectly with this two-toned bodysuit. I only wore it once for a professional photoshoot I did and the zipper burst mid-shoot. I didn‚Äôt even feel it until someone at the shoot mentioned it. The material is thick and hip hugging, but I was VERY disappointed in the zipper not staying in place. I will be returning for a replacement because this skirt is TOO cute not to have."
3.0,"Too big, opted for a deuter better engineering on dynamic support"
3.0,I bought this for my son for his zookeeper day at school. He loves the hat except it stabs at him in the head and ends up hurting him. I guess you get what you paid for.
3.0,"It's thin material, which makes it breathable, and I LOVE that! The piece begins the ears is a bit uncomfortable,  but can be adjusted to feel better. Started fraying after one wash though"
3.0,Size small is more medium.
3.0,Comfortable slippers.  My feet are narrow so they don't fit as well as I would like but for slippers they are fine.
3.0,Not what I expected.  Back of frame is open exposing back side of photo
3.0,It wasn‚Äôt quite as long in length as I expected but still super cute.
3.0,"This dress was extra long (I'm 5'4"") and had an abundance of fabric at the waist.  My mom is a seamstress and took it in in the waist and cut off 6 inches to make it look right on me.  Before she took in the waist I looked quite pregnant, and am not.  If you need the extra fabric or are pregnant, this would be great! The bust fits well.  I will surely not be putting it in the dryer for fear of the chest area shrinking."
3.0,"its pretty, but not very comfotable"
3.0,"dressy thin material for church/party, but my bra caused it to look terrible on me as it was tight at chest; loose atop boobs, loose under boobs."
3.0,"Love the dress, ordered one size up according to THEIR size chart and it's still too tight in the chest and waist. Oh well, maybe I'll lose some weight by spring when it's wearable again."
3.0,"I‚Äôve never seen joggers made from leggings type material. Usually they‚Äôre thick and like sweats. But these are like baggy leggings. Not really my favorite. It looks like I don‚Äôt know what size leggings I wear and ordered them way too big. They‚Äôre super thin unlike joggers I‚Äôve ever worn before. So to the naked eye you wouldn‚Äôt even think they were joggers. They are comfortable though. I wore them around the house because that‚Äôs really the only place I was comfortable wearing them. I just had a baby 10 weeks ago and I‚Äôve skimmed almost completely back to my prepregnancy weight as I am a very avid gym goer. I go every day. And these just made me feel like I had lost a whole lot of weight. Which I have but it looked like my legs and stomach was really flabby under them. They are squat proof though so that‚Äôs a plus. I used a piece of white card paper to see if you could see it through the joggers and you can‚Äôt even with the flash on. So they pass the test for that. If you like a looser legging fit, these are for you. Otherwise, size down and they may do better for you than they did for me."
3.0,It is kinda big but I shrank up after washing and drying. It's more grey and the sleeves are bright yellow and black.
3.0,"These shoes are well-consructed, comfortable, and definitely waterproof.  I like looking at them and wearing them.  I DO NOT like putting them on or taking them off.  The term ‚Äúslip on‚Äù is totally a misnomer.  The opening at the top of the shoe might accommodate the foot of an Asian woman acquainted with the ancient practice of foot binding.  However, I have a size 14 foot, and it‚Äôs necessary for me to cross one leg over the opposite knee and sort of aim my toes at the hole.  Even in that situation, one of the pull-on tab or the other gets jammed down into the shoe itself and has to be dug out with a finger.  And, while the shoe is advertised as a pull on and makes no claim to being a pull off, the shoes fit so snugly that it‚Äôs virtually impossible to stand up and pull one foot out of a shoe by holding down the back of that shoe with the other foot, as you can do with almost any other slip on shoe.  You gotta sit down and tug!!  So I‚Äôm keeping the shoes for the reasons stated in the first sentence of this review, but, if the slip-on feature is important, look elsewhere."
3.0,Smaller than I expected bit still cute. The tail pokes that thru the fabric needed a good sanding. Good for open weave cloth only
3.0,"I love this top looks great fits great feels soft and silky,  the only issue i had was with static I was constantly sparking"
3.0,The underwire comes out. Less than 3 wears and the wire was poking me.
3.0,"The shirt looks cute, however, the opening for the neck is too wide for me. Can't really return it because I already removed the tag."
3.0,Poor quality. Material rolls up.
3.0,"its very small, i love the design, and its deff steel boned.... i think maybe its small because i have fat on my stomach, thats the point right? if buying a corset for weight loss, its supposed to be tight lol. but i can breath in this the top is opened from my chubbiness but other then that its a good corset."
3.0,"A tough item to rate! It's not at all comfortable, had to be bent quite a bit to fit properly on my neck, and close to impossible to fasten with the fastener provided. I finally gave up on that and now just use a safety pin to fasten it.. Yet I love how it looks, and have always gotten compliments the few times I've worn it. I can only wear it to events no longer than a couple hours  or it chafes too much and I need to take it off.<br /><br />So one star for comfort and ease of use, and fives stars for how it loojs and the compliments I get - average of three."
3.0,Skin tight. I wear an xl. ordered a 2x thinking play it safe. It was skin tight
3.0,"The dress itself is beautiful, a little short but I‚Äôm also 6ft tall so it‚Äôs to be expected. However, the arms are WAY to tight and constricting which makes the dress uncomfortable. I‚Äôm 6ft and 185 pounds so order up if you want a comfortable fit."
3.0,"The material is as expected. The sleeves and length were too long, not as pictured. I had to chop 3 inches from the length which got rid of the scallop trim. Order 2 sizes smaller than normal."
3.0,I am returning these. The abdominal section fits oddly. I wondered if it was backwards so I tried it on that way and it was the same. It has shorts in the top area. Comfortable in the legs. But the fit is very odd.
3.0,"I‚Äôm 55 and weigh 125‚Ä¶ Are usually wear a small or an extra small. I ordered a small and the sleeves are a bit short‚Ä¶ Fits well other than that, maybe a tad tight in the shoulders. It‚Äôs cute and for $39 I‚Äôm keeping it. Looks a little cheap but it is LOL"
3.0,The dress is light weight very cute it runs really big the bottom is extremely wide iam 53 160 i needed a small
3.0,These are nice for the cost. The earrings are shiny and the backs stay on okay. I rated 3 stars because I have found the same quality and style from Claires for cheaper. The shipping was fast.
3.0,"It was a very nice watch band at first, it looked like leather, but then when it got wet it broke down the material quickly"
3.0,"I liked the feature set, but using it was a bit of a challenge at first.  Like other stated, the manual was not helpful.  It seems to be built tough however it stopped working on my first outing with it, restarting every minute or so."
3.0,"These are very cute packing cubes, and decent quality. Super useful for separating each persons clothes in our family of 5. I didn't really find them to be compression at all. You just stuff and zip. The laundry bag was too small in proportion for what can be packed in the cubes. For instance, I could get 3 days worth of clothing in the cubes, but not even 2 days of laundry in the bag. The Shoe bag was also small. It really only fit flip flops for the family. Also, the bag sizes are odd. The big one is too large, the small one is too small. I know I'm sounding like Goldilocks here, but I think the set would be better if it had two of the medium large bags, and three of the medium bags. I would not purchase again, and I will be looking for a more suitable family set."
3.0,Really made nicely. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and long waisted. So way too short so waistline was not right for me. Darn it!
3.0,Super soft but too small for my 7 year old to wear as a mask for school
3.0,The quality and style of these shoes is great if you can get your feet in them! I ordered the recommended size and ended up giving them away because they weren't anywhere close to fitting me.
3.0,"These slippers seemed very comfy, but a size 13 did not fit my size 12 feet. They were way too small. Order 3 sizes up and you may have better luck than I did."
3.0,NICE BUT NOT WHAT I WANTED.
3.0,"I got this for my wife for Christmas and we are only a little bit past Christmas now and it is already broken. My wife has had wallets like this before and always has a good amount of stuff in her wallet but actually had less in this wallet then she had in her last wallet which gave her no issues at all. I was very disappointed when she came home to show me the bottom of it ripped, I realize you don't want to over fill it but it shouldn't be ripping that easy, Like I said she had less in this one then her last one which is actually still working fine and will probably have to go back to that one.<br /><br />As for the look of the wallet, I think it looked really good and she loved the design of it. I have no issues with the way everything looks on it.<br /><br />I don't think I would go back to this brand, it could of been that I got one that wasn't up to par but after how quickly it broke I am disappointed."
3.0,I wore them once and decided to go buy my usual lucky brand gray boots.  I thought I'd try them at that cost but I assume you pay for the comfort level you get.
3.0,"I love the size, the color, the material, and that it folds up. I love the cell phone pocket on the front strap. I'm disappointed at an aspect of the design.  When I wear the sling from left shoulder to right hip, the zippers are on the &#34;bottom&#34; side when I slide the pack around. Makes getting things out of the bag without taking it off super awkward and uncomfortable, not too mention, things will fall out.  It's not my natural instinct to wear the sling on the other shoulder, but I might have to in order for it to function they way I want it to.  Concerned the water bottle will fall out if I do it that way."
3.0,Pretty great for the price
3.0,"I know this is listed as a petite but even at 5'3'"" it was too short for me.  Nice fabric though."
3.0,Way too big . I ordered a medium and it is so long on me it fits like a big large .
3.0,"This is super cute but it's not sized for American women.  It's extremely small. I purposely ordered 2x larger than normal,but it was still too small.  Disappointing."
3.0,"Ordered this for my Fitbit Versa 2, only the link band fit, the other one that folds over didn‚Äôt. Where the band actually attaches to the face of the watch was too big. The seller did respond to my email but the return process was too complicated.<br />Now I can only use One wristband and have had it for a little over a month, and the rose gold color is rubbing off at the clasp. I do not wear it in the shower and haven‚Äôt been working out so it hasn‚Äôt been getting wet. A little disappointed."
3.0,Socks are super cute and colorful but they stretch a lot and kinda makes the socks look different but still are comfy and pop out any outfit üòÅ
3.0,I wear ex-large but i guess when coming from other countries i must be a 2-3x......I gave it to my daughter who wears small.
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but the first time I wore it the top long jacket part came apart at the back shoulder seam, it sorta looks like it shredded! I‚Äôm not sure if I can fix it by sewing because the material is very thin!"
3.0,"Blouse was longer than expected, but nice blouse nonetheless."
3.0,Cute but very small in size
3.0,The fit on this dress was way off. I ordered a large ( I wear size 10-12 in dresses) and I was swimming in it. I should say that I am on the petite side so maybe if I were tall with bigger breasts it would fit better. The front is plunging! The print is beautiful and the quality was good for the price.
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt look quite as fluffy as it does in the picture. Not bad for the price though.
3.0,When I got mine it was sliver not black
3.0,I like the pattern and color. I usually wear a 2 x and its baggy after reading comments I went up 2 sizes and still fits more like a tshirt than a sweater. may give to my mother it is a better fit for her and she wears a large...this is a 4x.
3.0,I buy several long sleeves shirts and they are great.But the short sleeves quality is very poor.
3.0,"I actually love the glasses, the only thing is I thought they would have been a little more larger than what I received they are kind of small, but you can't beat the price"
3.0,"It fits the watch but very difficult to take off,  and is a large band for someone with a thick wrist"
3.0,"Faceted bead necklace, 18"" in length, arrived promptly and has good sparkle. Good for a pendant, especially pendants with a bit of dark pink/rose. On a red string, with simple silvertone hooking clasp (don't know if it is sterling silver).  Update: Lost the necklace on the third or fourth wearing, just disappeared from my neck. I suspect the simple hook clasp came undone. Reduced review to 3 stars. Will need to restring the beads with a closed clasp design next time."
3.0,Looks similar to the ring but it's much thinner.. I'm not really that happy with it but my husband likes it an wears it proudly
3.0,"Bummed I had to return this. The top is actually very cute and exactly like pictured and I would have kept it had it not been too tight. Nice cotton top but it definitely runs small. If you are small but busty then get a Medium. I thought I would be ok with the small since it's a very loose top but this rides up a lot because of the cinched shoulders and there is very little space in the armpit area, and since this is cotton I knew after 1 or 2 washes it would shrink."
3.0,"I'll be honest - I fell in love with the blue color when I saw this product. It's this bright, but deep blue that you just don't see much to be honest. I was a bit on the fence about the style (I'm hardly the most fashion forward person on the best of days and these aren't the best of days), but sometimes you need to stretch out of your comfort zone. I am usually a size 12/14 or a Large, but when I saw this product and looked at the dimensions, I thought I might want to try the medium. I didn't want to look like a whale caught in a net.<br /><br />The blue on the sweater when it came was definitely not quite the pretty blue on the website. It definitely looks a LOT cheaper in person. I knit and crochet, and if I had to use comparisons, it's like this product was made with a house brand yarn or Red Heart (no offense Red Heart, your products have gotten better over the years) than a custom spun die-lot yarn. Just - cheap, from the color to the feel of the yarn.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a loose-fit sweater, so I wasn't shocked at how big it was. Okay, I still was to an extent, but that was me, not the product. When I tried the product on, I immediately knew I would have to wear something underneath this, be it a camisole, a tank or a t-shirt. Not only does it show a rather lot, and I'm no Instagram Zoomer who can get away with it, but my body got cold just thinking about wearing this with nothing else on underneath.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm still playing around with wearing this garment, trying to see if the style is something that feels like me. I don't ever feel as effortless as the women modeling this, lemme tell you - when I do wear this, I feel like I'm wearing Mommy's sweater or just threw on my last available sweater that doesn't fit anymore and was bought super cheap on a whim.<br /><br />Obviously, your mileage may vary on whether this style is for you; I do think the color doesn't come off quite as nice as the model shows and also the sweater feels made out of cheaper materials. But if those aren't concerns for you AND you are super hip, you may love this."
3.0,"Bought XL, bit too small for 14 shoe size. Very thin material. Seem to be well made."
3.0,The pearls look like bumps instead of buttons.
3.0,The picture makes it look slim fit. The shoulders and arms fit right then the trunk is kind of big.
3.0,I like the idea of purchasing 1 handbag and getting many with it. But these bags were a bit disappointing. Not sturdy enough very flimsy. Cute for a night out but not long term.
3.0,"Nice, but too small...order 2 sizes larger."
3.0,"I love the colors but hate the chain it came with.  Also, the earrings are really heavy and although they don‚Äôt hurt, they do look like they‚Äôre pulling down your earlobe a little."
3.0,"The shirt fits well, I just wish the print was of better quality. In my opinion, it looks cheap. I still wear it but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again."
3.0,It‚Äôs ok..
3.0,"I‚Äôm 64 yrs old and it was too tight on top and the length was shorter than I expected, hit me just under my knees. Would probably be cute on me 20 yrs ago. The fabric could have been thicker too."
3.0,Love the fabric thickness and color but the lapel when zipped lays odd since I have a bigger bust. It's not a big deterrent but I constantly am readjusting it so it doesnt look like bunched up fabric around my neck. Washed it before wearing and the dye still bled onto my white shirt. But I think with subsequent washings it should be ok.
3.0,ok but bunchy on sides most likely a night gown not a dress.
3.0,Cute but for weird in the bust
3.0,This dress runs big. I put it on without knowing there was a side zipper until I took it off. It hung a bit strange in the back - no ‚Äústructure‚Äù just a straight down and bulky - maybe bc it was too big?  The front was cute and the V neck flattering but the material was itchy and I didn‚Äôt like where the buttons in the front gaped at the bottom.  Not see through just thin material.
3.0,nice dress just too much room in the waste area for me
3.0,"This purse is the perfect size, its just not the bright red i was looking for. I have 5 red wine purses with no shoes to match and bright red shoes with no purse to match üòîüòÖüôÑ im very unhappy about this. I wanted this purse in grey too, but it sold out. Im going to have to return this! C"
3.0,"This necklace is pretty, however, it looks Nothing like the pic shown at all"
3.0,This shirt has nice design but does run small & the material is pretty thin.
3.0,Not as nice as the picture but I kept it
3.0,"Art work not even close to picture online as far as clarity, color, or distinction."
3.0,Pretty ring. I thought stone would be lighter. Stone is darker than pictured here.
3.0,The ones I received do not look as good as the ones shown in the picture.  Also my ears are allergic to the earrings.
3.0,Smaller then I thought but fits
3.0,This necklace is beautiful and dreamy. It fits my average neck perfectly and hangs just above my collarbone. I love the color of it and the small jewels in the charms and along the top chain. I get a ton of compliments when wearing it. It‚Äôs major flaw however is that the two chains easily twist together and I find that I am constantly trying to unravel them but end up getting frustrating and leaving it twisted.
3.0,Runs kinda small but its good material
3.0,"I don't think I would buy these again. I wear size 5.5-6, but these dig into the back of my heel. I finally just decided to stretch them out, which has worked. They show with my work flats, which is super annoying, but I don't think they would show with any of my other shoes. They don't slip in the back."
3.0,"we love these.  They keep my daughter from slipping on the hardwood floors as she runs with abandon throughout our house.  My only complaint is that the insole on one of them came out after just one wearing and is now wrinkled and uncomfortable for her.  I just pulled it out and have hopes to glue it back in but for the price of these, I expected them to stay in one piece for longer."
3.0,"Not worth the money, just so-so."
3.0,"I know this is shown in the picture, but it is really, really black, and probably less transparent than the picture.  When you wear it, it looks more like a Halloween prop than a bug net.  Or like you're going to rob something.<br /><br />It is easily big enough to get over your head, but not large enough to fit over like a wide-brimmed cowboy hat or straw hat.  Reasonably heavy-duty."
3.0,Good for price but cheap
3.0,Cute shoes and great gold/platinum color. They keep my daughter feet warm and actually stay on. Three stars for cheap material and bow is wonky.
3.0,"I am an avid cyclist so I know how jerseys should fit.  I am 5'1"" and weigh 95 pounds.  In a good quality jersey, I need an extra small, though depending on the brand and cut, I can wear a small.  I like my jerseys form fitting but not skin tight.  After reading other reviews, I ordered the small.  It fit perfectly EXCEPT it was way too long in the torso - maybe as much as 6 inches.  The rear pockets were so low that they sat on my butt.  Unfortunately, it is going back tomorrow.  Loved the design and the colors were vivid.  Unless you have a very long torso, this jersey is not for you. Disappointed."
3.0,"very loose fabric, had to fix constantly throughout the day."
3.0,The bling fell out within hours. Really sad too because it was beautiful!<br /><br />Update: customer service saw my review and offered immediately to provide warranty service. They were easy to communicate with and are making the issue right. I‚Äôll let you know how the replacement works
3.0,After a passage of time color changed and become very ugly hehe my bb doesn‚Äôt like it anymore
3.0,"These are nice, but they are not substantial at all.  They are very light weight and dainty.  I like them, I just wish they were a little bigger."
3.0,Nice shirt but runs small and very slim
3.0,Nice  shirt but ran big.
3.0,"I wear a 34DDD, size 12 in most things, and the XL (size 12-14) fit alright. It was a little loose but not so much that I couldn't have worn it. i didn't try on the bottoms but they looked too big for me. I might have tried going down a size and see how that fit but I ended up finding another swimsuit I liked better anyway. The colors are just like the picture, very lovely and it was comfortable to wear, but I wasn't in love with it. Also the cut of the top piece is different in person than in the picture with much less plunge. Overall I got a weird feeling from it, like it was too loose all around although I had all the straps as tight as they'd go. It's not a bad swimsuit just also not amazing for me, and maybe other people will have better luck."
3.0,"They were shorter than I expected but I did order the 5 inch, so this was my bad"
3.0,"This is 2&#34; wide  x 2.75&#34; deep x 1.25&#34; high.  It's very small. Otherwise it is an OK box, as advertised. The color is true.  There was a partially torn off sticker on the bottom that probably said &#34;Made in China.&#34;"
3.0,"In some lights, this shirt looks slightly green. In others, slightly blue or grey. Certainly not as vividly green as the product images show. Despite this, an okay shirt for the price."
3.0,This sweater was bigger and bulkier than I was expecting.
3.0,product is not sufficient for winter. You need lots of layers to keep your baby warm
3.0,I have a large hat sized head and a lot of hair‚Ä¶ the hat is great‚Ä¶ but SUPER LARGE‚Ä¶
3.0,"This sweater is awful!!  Terrible fabric, it snagged within moments of putting it on, has a really odd odor. I really regret this purchase. I wont even be donating this item, I will be throwing it in the trash!! Waste of money!!"
3.0,Fits good. Fairly light weight material and not very well made. Design however looks really good
3.0,Very comfortable and nice but 2 buttons fell off with first wash on gentle cycle and hung dry.
3.0,Material is kinda stiff and not the nicest to touch.
3.0,"I didn't get this product for free or at discounted price for my &#34;honest&#34; review, I just bought it....and sent it back very same day.  The fair price for that pair of sunglasses shouldn't be more than $15 or $10. There is nothing new or exciting about them, feels more like a fisher price kids toy.<br />Pros: light, interchangeable lenses, nice hard case<br />Cons: cheap material, sweat and nose rubber pads are loose, poor quality lenses."
3.0,Cheap clear rubber
3.0,"The item itself was nice. I ordered 2; 1 for me and 1 for my friend, to be worn as toe rings. When they came in, I noticed that 1 was considerably smaller than the other. 1 package said it was a toe ring (the smaller of the 2) and the other package said it was a midi ring. There is no way the &#34;toe ring&#34; would fit an adult toe. I ended up keeping the midi ring for me and gave the &#34;toe ring&#34; to my teenage daughter who has tiny toes."
3.0,"Quality of skirt seems nice. Unfortunately the size was way too small. I am a size small in virtually every brand, but the small of this skirt did not fit."
3.0,"Great flannel shirt, but not fleece lined as advertised."
3.0,Really unhappy with the thin material it was made out of. It looks cool but for a large it is small.
3.0,Cute but VERY  tight fit. only for petite body types
3.0,This product is very cute but the shoes don't fit bc the elastic is too loose and therefore they slip up and down when walking. Cute shoe though.
3.0,they slide down throughout the day
3.0,"6'0"" - 185lbs - Athletic Male<br /><br />I ordered a size down as recommended but find the material to be too thin to even be considered a compression top. Doesn't seem to compress at all, just conforms to your body.  Although it doesn't compress as the reason I bought them, it does look and feel good!"
3.0,Fit size 8 5ft 3 148 lbs but not impressed with shipping at all it cost more for COD than it did for the actual item extremely disappointed
3.0,"I ordered based on the reviews and decided to get a large but I should've gotten a medium to have a more snug fit. My shoulders are narrow and my chest is a 36B so the top is a little full. It's still wearable, I just have to tuck it in really good to have a good look from the front."
3.0,It's a talking piece as in &#34; what the hell have got now? A wrist clock&#34; it does keep time all dials work but none glow in the dark and the strap does not fit well. It's stamped leather but I doubt it
3.0,It was too long for the sizes.
3.0,It's a bit tight in the shoulders.
3.0,Very snug for an XL otherwise nice coat.
3.0,advertised to be easy on and off but way too small for husband and he has small foot for a man
3.0,I feel it is too thin and not good for everyday wear.
3.0,"The watch was beautiful, but it was already ON and clicking.. Watch is still beautiful, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs New, giving as gift.. hope they can‚Äôt tell lol"
3.0,It‚Äôs as advertised. For you he first hour wearing it was very snug as I desired. I liked that it came up about five inches above my belly button.<br />Once I got in the car and then after it started to roll down. I tried numerous times to bring it up to where I thought it originally was but just kept rolling down to my belt line.  I‚Äôll update if I do discover that it was something I was doing to cause this. I‚Äôll give it another try.
3.0,"This bracelet seems to be decently built, although my main issue with it is that it does not fit a 42mm super ocean due to the end links being too short.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller when it arrived because I saw that the end links were hollow, and the photo showed a solid one, they replied and said that this is what their inventory showed was correct. I decided to keep it as my super ocean needs a band, however I won't use this as I don't trust it to stay on with the short end links. This may fit a 36mm but I don't have one to test it on."
3.0,"Long gray dress, stretchy, cheaply made, even the cut out design is cheap, it just looks like someone used scissors.<br />Cannot recommend"
3.0,"I like the size and look of the pack.  It's now my go to travel bag.  But, within the first few hours of using it the Velcro cam off the small pocket on the back.  Also the strap is a ridiculous length.  If you're a very tall heavy person it may work for you.  Otherwise it's annoying."
3.0,Got this for my daughter's ceremony and it fits nothing like the picture but we are pushed for time so she will make it work.
3.0,"Fits pretty much as expected. If you‚Äôre between sizes, def size up. If you want a looser fit, size up as well!<br />It‚Äôs also not a soft tee. Very stiff."
3.0,"Love the quality , SMALL !!!!"
3.0,Nice lenses and fit perfectly. 3 only because Doesn't have the word &#34;polarized&#34; on the lens as shown in the picture. Comes in a nice soft case. I would absolutely recommend for replacement lenses in the future.
3.0,"Bought these for gifts and although they are nice, the zippers aren't very sturdy."
3.0,Earrings appears larger than the actual size. I was very disappointed. Retuned them for that reason only. Love the look of them but would like them much larger.
3.0,"I bought this purse thinking the patent leather would make it easier to keep clean.  So far, it hasn't been a problem, but the finish is such a heavy, plasticky coating that if it really is genuine leather under neath, it almost seems a waste.  Because of the heavy coating, the purse is very stiff, including the handles, and I have not yet been able to get the detachable shoulder-strap to unkink.  The purse's hardware is much more yellow gold-tone than it appears to be in the photos.  Think 1980s brass furniture.  It is real metal, though, and not gold painted plastic.<br /><br />It's a good size bag and holds a lot of stuff.  One thing I hadn't noticed from the pictures is that it has only one main compartment instead of two equal sized compartments divided by a  thin, zippered compartment.  The zippered compartment that cuts through the middle of the main compartment ends a couple inches above the bottom of the purse.  What this means is that you can't really designate one section as being for A, B, C items and the other section for X, Y, Z items because things will roll back and forth along the bottom of the bag and you never know which side to look in when you're trying to find something.  You'll definitely want to get a makeup pouch for any beauty and grooming products you carry in your purse or you'll never be able to find them.<br /><br />It does have two open, pocket slots for your cellphone and... (ipod, sunglasses, keys?) as well as a side zippered compartment and the abovementioned zippered pouch.  I didn't dislike it enough to return it, but it isn't as nice as I was expecting it to be based on the photos and what I spent on it.  I doubt it will last as my primary purse very long- not because I don't think it will hold up, but because I will probably feel compelled to buy something better pretty soon.."
3.0,These were very cute but too large for what I like.
3.0,"This suit runs a size to small, I wear a large and that is what I bought and it was super tight and the top did not hold much at all with the pads in the suit, took them out and it was better."
3.0,Product is comfortable but it does NOT hold you in it stretched out after first use.<br /><br />If you are a person with a lot to compress and you need a good body shaper to hold you in this is not the one at all!!<br /><br />But very comfortable
3.0,"These are my second shorts, they are super comfortable and great price but the second ones does not match my order .. don‚Äôt understand how that can happen.."
3.0,The top did not cover me as all. I had to end up buying another white top just so I could still use the bottoms. They were small too but the top..even if you were a B cup it would cover your nipples.
3.0,Looked pretty good but eye holes were in a weird position and the mask positions itself oddly on your face. Also the elastic string wears down and breaks fast.
3.0,Fit more like underwear in crotch area.  Open in the middle.
3.0,"Overall, this is a beautifully well made costume. Especially for the price!  I ordered a Medium. The skirt and belt fit perfectly. The bra cups fit more like a small. I wear a USA bra size between a 32c/d. So, if anyone else is around this size, order a large. The belt might be a little on the big size but that‚Äôs easier to modify than the bra. I also ended up adding hooks to the neck and belt closure areas(for my safety due to costume mishaps). The velcro is not that sturdy and was mostly unstitched.  All pretty minor adjustments in the bellydance world ;)  Other than all of that, this is the second costume I‚Äôve ordered from Royal Smeela. I think they are both gorgeous. I will order more in the future."
3.0,Me gusta como luce lo plateado con negro
3.0,Cute and quickly shipped. Not near enough support and really wish it had adjustable straps.  The front sits way too low.
3.0,They hurt the bottom of my feet.  Trying to adjust in time.
3.0,Nice swimsuit but bottom is to small top is good I got s xl
3.0,"Eh, the fabric is cheap and kind of clinging, but I obviously bought this as my starter mumu, and for that, it certainly does the job. Comfortable for lying around the apartment binge watching netflix. Probably not warm enough to make it through the winter though."
3.0,Beautiful watch. I get lots of compliments on how it looks unique. The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is because it doesn't keep the right time. I have to resetting the clock so often that I don't bother anymore. I just use the digital time.
3.0,Arrived on time made in China soso quality
3.0,"When it delivered for my baby, Right show one was so dirty."
3.0,"I ended up giving it to a friend,. It was too small on me."
3.0,they are ok. they fit fine. they are oddly tight around the ankle however. i have never experienced this with socks before.
3.0,Love how they look
3.0,Super cute and colors are great buy runs about 2 sizes small.
3.0,"Bought this as a gift for my pregnant sister, she wanted trendier pregnancy clothing and I thought this would fit the bill! I expected it to be more oversized based on the picture. Also, the midline where the pockets are is at an unflattering spot in my opinion."
3.0,Like it but the color is too yellowish
3.0,"This should have been a flattering, casual dress but it was sort of ‚Äúsack-like‚Äù, even with a tie. Runs large."
3.0,"Great jeans, washed well and ordered a size up after looking at measurements and what was said about the jeans. Love that they have no spandex in them, like jeans back in the 70's."
3.0,Super cute but too tight and unflattering. Orderd a large.
3.0,I love the design but the fabric is way cheaper than it looks in the picture. I also feel like it was overpriced for the quality.
3.0,"It came very well packaged and in perfect condition. It is the first time I buy this brand of watch. It looks very nice in photos, but it's very large and very heavy, even for a man's hand. Hope it works well. Next time I'd rather buy f√≥ssil."
3.0,I got three blue earings and missing a white one.
3.0,Not crazy about it as tye combination. Started wearing thr ling sleeve shirt under my scrubs. Havent worn the short sleeve one yet
3.0,Need to order up a 1/2 size or so
3.0,"I really loved these glasses at first, mainly because they are lightweight and wide. Unfortunately one of the nose pieces fell off about two weeks after I got them and I couldn't find it to try to glue it back on. I was really trying to take care of them by keeping them in the provided case when I wasn't wearing them but it wasn't enough lol."
3.0,I took a larger size and these run too small.
3.0,"The socks were ok but all the pictures of Danny‚Äôs face were in half and badly matched on the seams. There was not one full photo of his face. Bought this for a child that loves him. He was happy but as a gift giver, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I‚Äôm surprised that any type of quality control would even pass this.  I‚Äôm wondering if these are the rejects being sold here."
3.0,On the small size. The quality is ok.
3.0,Ordered for a project for my 5th grader. Shipped fast.  He had a ton of fun wearing the mustaches.
3.0,"Bought these for my 9 year old son because they looked like they were silver. We received them and they were lavender! There is no indication of color in the description online but on the box it says &#34;lilac.&#34; I probably would not have bought these if it stated the color was lilac. Luckily, my son could care less and is happy with his new cleats. That's all that matters."
3.0,Nice leather and good for any gentleman.
3.0,The photo on the website shows a much different type of filter pocket opening.  The one that is actually in the mask only opens on one side and you have to fold the filter almost in half and then try to wiggle it around inside the pocket to get it to flatten out.  Still usable but not very easy to use.  The metal nose piece and chin piece fit well but the pocket opening prevented me from giving this a higher star rating.
3.0,"It works well, it's kinda poorly built, plus the the breath fogging. But other than that it's my day to day."
3.0,It is way shorter than anticipated and the color is more orange than red..
3.0,"These earrings are a nice value (3 pack) but one of them arrived broken, plus they were a tad too big for my taste. If you don't mind big statement earrings, then I would say you would probably like these! They are pretty and unique."
3.0,"The style of this purse is great. It would hold all my things, but it has an odor that didn't go away for me even after 4-5 days of airing it out. I returned it due the odor issue. The smell reminded me of petroleum blend."
3.0,Nothing special. Very cheaply made. Soft though.
3.0,The skirt was advertised as with slit. I thought the split would be small at the back of skirt. It literally had rips and slits all over the whole skirt with frayed bottom hem.
3.0,As stated in the topic.
3.0,The shirt is ok. Thin flannel. I'm a 10-12 and this shirt was a tad tight around the hips.
3.0,"I love the scarf, but I ordered grey and it is definitely more of a green color."
3.0,"It is very quiet.  But there is no documentation for this specific product that I can find.  After much searching it appears to be a direct copy of the Watterott Silent Step Stick, which has some documentation."
3.0,"The colors are nice, but the material is very thin."
3.0,This is a cute top for layering but you have to wear something over it. The arm holes go down past the bottom of my bra.
3.0,Service was gray bye It does not fit. Maybe I should send it back but I thought I could get some stretchy elastic in LinkedIn it and re-string it.
3.0,Just started to use this new belt but the buckle is slightly defective. the prong keeps somehow pushing through (not being stopped by the groove it should rest in) making it impossible to get in the belt hole when you try to put on. This is like my third belt from this company and I‚Äôve never had this issue. With some effort I can push the prong back in place but it just keeps happening.
3.0,"It is brown color, not pink"
3.0,Clamp was not really secure.
3.0,I didn't expect anything too nice when I ordered this since it wasn't expensive but figured it would work. It was actually pretty sturdy and not flimsy and cheap feeling like I expected. That was a nice surprise. I did end up switching the chain out for one I already had but not because it looked bad or anything like that. I just have sensitive skin and can only wear certain materials. The only part I was disappointed with was the writing on the ring. The color blends in too much with the gold and it's pretty faded. Unless you look up close you can't really see it. :(
3.0,Fit well.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 130lbs.  The snaps on the waist piece to the stockings sucks.  It‚Äôs not what I expected and I ended up not being able to snap it.
3.0,The shirts are small. If you wear a large I'd would get and charge or even an xxlarge
3.0,"A little confusing. There's not front or back, so there's no real space for a butt. The material is a little questionable because it's thick, but it looks decent. Really long, but tiny waist. I'm 5'2'' 115 lbs, wears small."
3.0,Quality is not bad - they are a bit chunkier / less fine than they look in the photo but they are pretty nice.  My hands /fingers are small - my ring size ranges from 5 - 6 and these were WAY too big for me. The larger ones were several sizes too large so unfortunately i had to return them. Good value though if they fit you!
3.0,"Looks cute, and fits ... kinda. When I bend over my boobs fall out. I usually wear an 36D and I got a large... which was the right size according to the size chart."
3.0,size did not hold up after washing
3.0,Very cute dress the top is big not a good fit
3.0,"I really wanted to like this bra and would have except that the tips of the wire pinch or dig in at the outer ends.  The cups fit, the center lies flat on my chest, the shoulder straps tighten enough (usually they don't, even when new), and the band is comfortable. The seam on the cup doesn't bother me.  The fabric feels good."
3.0,"I really liked this bag. The perfect size, plenty of pockets, and I really liked not having a separate wallet. I‚Äôve had this bag for 2 years and 3 months and the tab that holds the strap broke and now I need to find a new bag."
3.0,"These do fit as expected, but they're not consistent. The length is just shy of my ankle, so they feel a bit short. One pair, the waistband fits great. The other, it's like the waistband was not seen with elastic at all and is very difficult to get on. I like these, but I wish they fit the same."
3.0,"The dress itself is beautiful especially for the price. It definitely runs smaller than your recommended size and the color is different than pictured. I ordered purple and the color that came is more of an iris. The fabric is stretchy but I am going to try a bigger size to see if it's a touch more flattering. Otherwise, I'll have to return this one."
3.0,returned  the item
3.0,But it was too big
3.0,"My husband wanted some fun dotted black socks, there are too much, and cheap as he says. he would rather dress socks like this with smaller dots and more of them."
3.0,"The foot fits very well, a little tight around the leg to the point it leaves a mark."
3.0,I was hoping it would be bigger and a little heavier.
3.0,"I bought a large and it was slightly too big. I tend to buy a size up. The medium would have been too tight for sure, but slightly to large for me."
3.0,"This dress had so much potential!  The detail on the hem looked adorable online and this skater style always looks cute in my daughter. Well, this dress is the exception. The material is, well, weird. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but it feels weird. Not cottony, not exactly polyester either. On top of that the fit was off. Not super flattering; made a very thin girl look a little thick in the waist. Anyway, cute for the money but not the perfect dress."
3.0,"Gave it 4 stars for flattering only because of the sheerness, so it wasn‚Äôt very flattering to my backside :)<br /><br />The dress fit perfectly and was extremely comfortable. I bought it for a vacation in CA and it would have been great. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 135, 34DD. There was enough stretch to fit my bust but then cinch my waist to shape me.<br /><br />I got the gradient orange because I have a ton of black and navy dresses. I wanted a summery color. However, it was too sheer on the bottom half for me so I returned it."
3.0,Flip flops to small.  Sent back.  I didn't like them either.  The plastic piece in between the toes was to hard.  Very uncomfortable.
3.0,"Its very comfortable and I have worn it for two days now to work. The only issue I have with it is that it rolls down whenever I bend down. If the waist cincher was higher up until under the breast line I believe it will be perfect because it will definitely smooth out the entire torso. It pushes my fat up top sort of popping out like a muffin top. But, I wear loose shirts so I hide it well. It doesn't really lift my buttocks, I am assuming because my buttocks are firm or the elastic to push up isn't thick enough to do the job. What I like about the product is that it is thigh length and helps prevent my inner thighs from touching each other and makes me look more smooth around my buttocks and thighs. I don't have much cellulite though. If you do have lots of cellulite this might work because the product is sort of thick and might be able to smooth them out. I think this is a great work out pair of shorts. It stretches well and hides under your clothes well if you go to the gym. Overall, I like the product and keeping it for casual work day wear and work out wear. I wouldn't wear this for a night out of town under sexy tight clothing. It will push your fat up top, which will let everyone know you are wearing something; unless you really dont have any belly fat and want to wear it to look smoother then this will be perfect."
3.0,I liked it but the gold has a little bit of a cheap plating look to it.
3.0,"When it first arrived, there was a strong smell from the material (like something from the dye/coloring or material being new) so I had to &#34;air&#34; it out first before really using it, but otherwise it seemed to be in good condition. (FYI, the material's not real &#34;soft&#34; and warm, like a wool or cotton shawl.)"
3.0,"The watch itself looks pretty nice. The light color around the face almost makes it looks like fine diamonds. It looks like a dressy watch. But I could not get the watch to close. The pin that holds the opposite band was down too far so that it could not thread. I looked on the web to see if I could correct this but I could not. If mine were not defective, this would be a nice watch, although listed price is way too high for what you get."
3.0,The cut of the bottom exposes underwear easily. She only wears it at home when practicing.
3.0,Was no where near the push up explained. And the cups were a bit too big.
3.0,"I like the shoes, they are super cute but the bow fell off the first time my daughter wore them. Not impressed.."
3.0,Strong cute simple
3.0,The straps are an issue I thought being wider it would help but unfortunately no
3.0,"Editing my review. I put on the second pair of capri leggings this morning and new in the pack, the crotch had a hole in it where the seem wasn't sewn together right"
3.0,"I like the length, and the sleeve length. Like the looser fit. The fabric was not as soft as I expected. Looks very much like a uniform to me. Good for wearing around the house, very casual"
3.0,"Material is thin, the scrunched part looks odd and it just looks more like a gown than a dress. I would not wear this out because of that. My 9 year old said it looks like a gown a fancy person would wear."
3.0,Simply put : This watch was cumbersome!
3.0,"The dress is cute but it was too tight across my chest I had to return for a larger size, but even that one lost its shape because it was too big. The dress does not stretch so keep in mind."
3.0,"Nice apron and is very colorful. Ties are a bit short. As a larger sized person, I had to add ribbon to the ties to fit properly."
3.0,Socks fit just right. Material is on the thin side but might be appropriate for the summer.
3.0,"Got this for my daughter's 7th birthday. It's very pretty, the stone was a bit crooked but no big deal for $16.<br />Had it for 3 days before she bit it and it crushed her finger until her dad cut it off her. Obviously that was partly her fault, but it definitely unhappy with how easily it was crushed."
3.0,"I am 5'2"" and 110 pounds. I bought the small short sleeve dress and it is way too large on me. It is too long and way too wide. However it is a nice dress so if they gave the option for an extra small I would purchase it. Just be cautious on the size you purchase."
3.0,"These were flat, no curve to face.<br />Fit small. Kinda cute tho."
3.0,"Like most people said, they were too thick for my ears even after 30 years of piercings.  However, I used my gas stove and two pairs of pliers to stretch the ends thinner and recurve so I didn't have to return them.  They are now acc4ptable and still pretty, with a longer front dangle..."
3.0,I loved this dress but it was too big on me I am usually a 14-16 in dress so I decided to go with the 1x and it was too big on me. So I am returning it and getting a smaller size like a medium. It is so stretchy and comfortable so I suggest you get a smaller size unless you like loose dress but in my opinion I think it would look nice tight.
3.0,The lobster claw broke and we lost the charm a few days later..
3.0,"I love the style, the price, the material .... but it is too small!!"
3.0,Love the dress but return it because of the sizing issue.
3.0,"The shirt is a pretty, but extremely small. I would recommend sizing up at least 2 sizes."
3.0,"Glasses were dope for the price, but mine arrived scuffed up on the lens. This is for a costume, but their second function was to aid in slayin hot trim. Hopefully the scuffs insinuate a rugged masculinity."
3.0,I love the dress but I think I ordered a size too big! I‚Äôm keeping the dress but making it shorter and some other stuff. It‚Äôs really comfortable and good if you have curves
3.0,"I bought this to use for a Alice in wonderland dress. It however fit a bit short. Size wise it was on point, but for the length is it shorter than the photo shows (mid thigh/higher). I washed it and hung up I did not dry just to be on the safe side, but it did the job. Will use for pjs."
3.0,"Very nice, but too small for adult ears"
3.0,I thought it was going to be a bit longer. It is warm material and itchy. Not what I expected.
3.0,"Cute...but the fastener balls don't stay on.  Additionally, I noticed some irritation when wearing these, so metal may not be very high quality"
3.0,"I have always loved these Crocs, this is my 3rd pair. But when I put this pair in the sun to dry, they split at the seams and got all warped. This has never happened to me before!"
3.0,"It is a cute mask, but my child does not like it. Although he is big for his age, my child is only 2 almost 3 and this is very snug on him. It is difficult to get over his head. He prefers the masks that go around your ears."
3.0,I wish they had bigger sizes for necklaces and bigger jewelry
3.0,Would have liked to have known that it was a floppy mask.
3.0,The necklace was amazing but the first time I wore it one of the gold tips fell off somewhere.  Now I can't wear it again.  So it turned out to be a one time wear purchase:(  contacted seller but not response yet.
3.0,Ordered an XXL when I normally wear an XL. The XXL fit like a Large. Very warm if you can figure out the correct size.
3.0,Smaller than the size indicated.
3.0,I bought this for every day wearing for work but what I don't like about it is when ever I wash my hands the ring stays wet underneath and stays wet.
3.0,"Denim hat well made adjustable to fit ,<br />Would be better if it were embroidered logo or patch , logo is an iron on decal ,so it won‚Äôt last long ...should of stated that in description I wouldn‚Äôt of bought it ...<br />Would cost me more to return it ..."
3.0,The heart print is very plastic
3.0,"The watch looks beautiful, however when I received it one of the gold number marks was off. It's just floating around inside the watch and I have no way of fixing it. I'll need to ask for a replacement.<br />----<br />UPDATE:<br />I contacted the seller and they were more than helpful. They've given me a refund and I plan on ordering another one..hopefully this one won't be damaged as I really do love the look of the watch!"
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about these shirts. They are thin and light weight. They are stretchy and very comfy. They hang at just the right length. The colors are perfect. But there is a seam that goes up the middle of the back. I'm not really sure why it's there. I think it would look better without it. And then there is the sleeves. They too are the right length and are just as stretchy. However I think they would be better if they were a bit loose, sort of like the bottom of the shirt. Now with all that said, I have hand washed the gray one three times and laid it flat to dry and now there are holes forming. It is now past the return date, so I guess I'm out of luck. Will I buy this again, probably not. When I buy something, I want it to last more than a couple weeks. Did I like it while it lasted, yes."
3.0,To causual
3.0,This band is so adorable! But so small! By the end of the day it hurt my wrist. If you have super small wrists go for it but if not find something that has a size!
3.0,"Made cheap for the money, just ok!!!"
3.0,I reordered the XXXL.<br />I normally wear a L-XL so I ordered the 2X based on reviews but it's still way too small. Fits like a L. I'll update my review if the 3X works out!
3.0,"The color I got (apricot) looked very different than the picture. The picture makes it look like a very light pink, but in person looks like a yellowy tan. The holes also have a darker color around them that makes them appear like burn holes, which is fine, but not what I expected. The fit is good, I usually wear small/medium and got a large to get an oversized look. It comes down past my bum and the sleeves end just a couple inches above my elbow, overall loose. It‚Äôs not that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the shirt to anyone, but I‚Äôd take the product image with a grain of salt bc what you get will definitely look different."
3.0,"I didn‚Äôt like the mesh, which went up higher and was more see-through than I expected, so I returned. If you don‚Äôt mind that, they‚Äôre good."
3.0,"I don't know how to feel about the buttons, but it is well made. A size 6t is is a 2T. Disappointed."
3.0,I think I‚Äôm used to VS activewear and it‚Äôs tighter. These slide down all the time and I find myself not wanting to wear them. Otherwise they fit fine and are made well.
3.0,I loved the material. I hated the super thin zipper pull. The dress fits on the smaller side.
3.0,"I really like the color and style of these leggings. I love the pockets as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they ride down all day. I cannot workout in these comfortably. They fit well everywhere else but for some reason, they can‚Äôt stay up at the waist."
3.0,Its cheap and up close it looks the part. also everything looks pink not red as you might imagine. As long as you arnt the one wearing them they look great.
3.0,they slip off my head.  ?  maybe my heads too big haha
3.0,"First one was perfect, but I stained it.<br />Second one I purchased also fits well but is somewhat misshapen."
3.0,"I was  happy to receive this in a very timely manner as I had read the comments and thought this would be perfect for travelling.  Unfortunately, after downsizing the items I was taking with me and placing them into the bag, the zipper tongue promptly broke as I zipped the main compartment closed.  I had to separate the zipper in order to remove my items.  It is a cute small bag, but I would be cautious.  I didn't have much in the main compartment when the zipper broke.  I will not buy this product or any from this name again."
3.0,Got this for my husband who is an easy loose 1xl. I ordered a 3 xl in case it ran small. But Boy DID IT RUN SMALL . It fit more like an adult medium/ large. I even double checked my order to make sure I didn't order the wrong size. Disappointed because He Really Loved it...but had to send it back.
3.0,"Bought two pairs, good support!"
3.0,"If you are even remotely tall, do not get these unless you like them at mid calf. These are not ankle length for anyone over 5‚Äô5‚Äù"
3.0,It fit my grandson...I spent time in SEA and the Asian sizes are not exactly the same as ours but it is a good looking shirt and well made.
3.0,"Love the color, the only thing is that it runs big. I ordered a Large and it looks like an xl or 2x. Its pretty big"
3.0,"Shipping was great and fast, nothing wrong with the company. It's a cheap necklace, doesn't look like the picture. My 7 year old niece loves it."
3.0,I like the dress but a little big on me.
3.0,"For the value these are really nice glasses. I do feel like I have to be careful with how I put them on so I don't break them and I am not convinced they are really polarized. I feel like I don't have the same protection I have had with our polarized glasses. For fashion the price can't be beat. I'm just not sure they'r really polarized. The card they come with says to put the glasses on and look at the card and pictures appear. They do. However, with other sunglasses ( Raybans ) the picture doesn't appear. So are they just not AS polarized as the Raybans? Anyhow, good value and very nice looking."
3.0,My daughter said this is very scratchy.
3.0,Fabric is horrible. L
3.0,"I used this watch for summer camp and it worked out very well. The only thing I noticed was that the paint chipped off after two days of wearing it at home. Overall, it serves its purpose (to give you the time), and it's very cute until you can't wash out the dirt that has accumulated on the watch over time."
3.0,"Picture shows silver colored base metal and they were gold, not what I needed."
3.0,"I ordered this for Halloween and everyone complimented my look, it was perfect! Only problem I had was there were holes in the seams where it wasn‚Äôt stitched properly in the armpits and a couple spots on the legs. So I‚Äôm not sure how it will fair out trying to wear it again. Otherwise a great bodysuit."
3.0,The dress is cute but the color was not what I expected at all. It was listed as red which is what I wanted so that i could match my husbands shirt but it was more like orange with some red accents. The quality is not the greatest either. It will do for a summer dress but not for what I wanted to use it for. I was disappointed but really didn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of returning it
3.0,"I loved this watch when I first got it.  After just maybe 2 weeks the crystals around the face started coming off.  After 2 more weeks the crystals around the face were gone, but the bling on the sides were still there and I was still happy.  With in a month the watch stoped working.  Maybe it had a defectice battery.  Rather than fool around with it, I just bought another watch!"
3.0,"I like the style of this sandals for men, but a very strong Chemically odor the smell is sickening. I let them air out and the smell is still there. They are leather slip on men sandals with soft leather material, soft sole,  non-slip wear-resistant, Proven√ßal impact protect the toes, two way wear with the adjustable  straps or not."
3.0,I like the fit and durable material but the buckell doesn't hold on very well keeps slipping out
3.0,"The XL was not true to size. The one I received said XL but looked like a medium. I could not give it as a gift. So, I  had to buy a new item  on Amazon."
3.0,"I bought them for myself! Bottom too short in crouch and in length!! I like the material in both the top and bottom, but would not buy this brand again because the bottom is not comfortable!!"
3.0,The dress itself was okay the quality was very poor.
3.0,"The ""Funny Party Hats Dress Up Hats for Adults Costume Party Hats for Men Women Unisex"" is kinda ""thin and plasticy"", but it's it's not misrepresented."
3.0,"The only reason Im giving this any stars is because the person that received it absolutely loved it. It took a FOREVER to get and when it came, it really didn't look that complicated. It was soft and the cats were cute but I was NOT happy about the arrival time. I ordered it on the fourth of December and it got here two days after Christmas."
3.0,"These could have been comfortable if they had used the same material on both sides. The edges of the seams are very sharp and uncomfortable, made of a very stiff fabric. The elastic is too long if you want to only lengthen a little bit. It will lengthen a minimum of 2.25 inches, and that's way more than I needed. They were a waste of money for me, because it's not worth the postage to send them back. They were, however, well made, and that's why I gave 3 stars. But I would not recommend them or buy them again.<br /><br />Update, if you cut a tiny curve out at the sharp edges, it makes them more comfortable, but it might also make them wear out faster."
3.0,I didn't really notice much difference driving at night with these.  Ended up returning them. Felt cheesy wearing them.
3.0,thought it was bigger then 1/4 of an inch. very small. item.looks to be a lot bigger then it was.
3.0,"To big, hurts ears and fog up"
3.0,The design does not allow you to use the last hole in adjusting the strap.
3.0,They are OK
3.0,"This band is SO THICK. Where the band overlaps (after the buckle), it sits almost a half inch off my arm! It's like wearing a thick, cheap bracelet. It gets in the way and hurts my wrist any time I'm leaning against something. Constantly gets stuck on my sleeves. The tackiness/chalkiness of the material doesn't help. And the band doesn't stay tucked in the rungs, which is annoying. I've worn this for 2.5 months but can't stand it any more. I'm not sure I could have known how thick this was before buying, I'm not seeing the thickness listed in the product details anywhere."
3.0,"I was disappointed with the plastic case and cheap quality of this product since it was not cheap. My grandson said, &#34;it is only a toy, so don't feel badly.&#34; He is happy to have it."
3.0,These would be very good for the UV protection but not really good for the compression
3.0,This purse is so hard to get in and out of. The clasp area doesn‚Äôt fit properly. Very hard to clasp back.
3.0,"nice, but has no stay in place threading in centre."
3.0,An overly expensive product for being plastic or poly or whatever they‚Äôre made of.
3.0,Good material quality but shorter than expected
3.0,Nice shirt but the picture makes it appear sharp with a little shine.  Instead it is matte and not as clean cut or sharp looking.
3.0,"product looks great, just ran too small."
3.0,One side of the band was stretched and was distorted. I have very large wrists and it was just a tad tight. The screen cover is good for protecting from cracks but can hold water against the screen.
3.0,"I think my son will enjoy this watch but before i give it to him, I was charging and setting it up so it would be ready to go when he received it. But after charging, the watch turns on, but I have no options for menu or games or anything. Only thing is the clock face that I can change that shows time and date. I read in the very poor manual that in order to get to the menu from the home screen, you simply tap the power/menu button, however when I push the power button on mine, it turns the display off, and when I press it again it takes me back to home screen showing date and time. No option for anything else. Am I missing something here, or did I get a defective product? Please help"
3.0,"I like it, but a couple of things bug me a bit.  The finish is not smooth, a little &#34;bubbly&#34; rough.  I happen to have necklace I took apart that happens to have the same feather as is embedded in this pendant.  I couldn't tell for certain from the photo, but that is an open loop at the top of the feather which bugs me.  I think the loop should either be cut off or something put in it (makes it look incomplete as it currently is)."
3.0,Le qued√≥ un poco peque√±o mi hijo va para 7 y parece q le mandaron para un ni√±o m√°s peque√±o
3.0,To big for 1 key
3.0,"The jacket itself is nice, but the sizing is way off. I ordered a 2xl and was sent a 7xl according to their sizing chart. It fit like a 4xl."
3.0,No problems but I will give as a gift as it didn‚Äôt suit my persona.
3.0,"I purchased this purse to replace one I've had for several years. It ended up being smaller and of a lesser quality. I switched back to my old purse. I will probably use this one eventually, when my other wears out completely, but I was a bit disappointed."
3.0,"I wore them before washing. They worked perfectly. I was SO excited. Then, I washed them.  They will NOT stay on my feet now. It was so disappointing.  So, if you needed a pair for a special occasion, like a wedding...they would work well. Just don't expect more than one good use out of them.  If they could make them work longer these would be amazing."
3.0,"I just received this blouse today. I am 5' 4 1/2 inches tall and weigh 115. Since reviews indicated it ran small, it purchased the medium. It fit just right, not too big.  BUT, the lower star score is because it was NOT a long sleeved blouse, but a quarter length sleeve and they fit a little tight at the area just below the elbow.  I am returning this blouse and will continue my search."
3.0,"The blouse fits good.  However I donot like the material that is use.  You have to hand wash and even then it tends to round up.  Therefore you will not get more that about seven wear out of it, if so much."
3.0,"It was nice and fuzzy, but poorly made. I didn't even get to wear this yet and there was already a hole in the arm sleeve. As for fit, it seems to fit as expected."
3.0,The fabric is soft but very thing. I guess it could be a good casual dress but way too fitting for work
3.0,This shirt it 2 pieces. I have a large bust and this shirt is not made for people with one. The sequence piece is very tight and cheaply made. There is no stretch with it.  the cowel neck doesn't sit very well. Not at all like the picture. I would recommend this shirt for small bust women only.
3.0,"Was expecting a more straight line pant.  More like a jogger..  The legs are too big, like a standard pajama pant leg.  Not cute, thin, but ok to hang around the house with."
3.0,My package of 12 was one short. I needed exactly 12 for party favors so it was pretty disappointing! The product it's self is cute and as described.
3.0,Not very thick if your using this for Covid cover must wear mask under
3.0,Nice dress. Cute but the size is very big.
3.0,"the elastic in the shorts was broken when they arrived and they have a really odd fit. but overall, they‚Äôre not bad."
3.0,"This necklace looks NOTHING like it does in the photos. It's not purple, it's bright blue with gold flecks and made of cheap plastic. I have the occasion to wear costumes often so I'll definitely still be wearing it. In fact I already have for one of my Mardi Gras costumes, but don't expect to wear it anyplace nice.<br /><br />When I get around to it I'll add a photo."
3.0,"*edit to add: after just a few times wearing it is super green on the chain around the neck. Can't wear with hair up. Almost can't even wear with it down, it turns so quickly.<br /><br />Beautiful necklace! Great length and will match so many outfits. This a versatile necklace and you will not be disappointed if you buy it."
3.0,"Es m√°s peque√±o de lo que indican la medidas, tuve que comprar otro porque lo necesitaba para l fecha que me lleg√≥"
3.0,This item broke the first time I wore it.
3.0,"Beautiful, but falls to one side constantly."
3.0,As usual the model makes it look great but in reality the shirt came small for its size and the material wrinkles VERY easily. If your looking for a shirt to bum around the house in then this is it. If your looking for a shirt you will look great in and your friends will envy keep shooping!
3.0,"This was nice in theory and maybe I would have liked it more if it was for a costume. It just wasn‚Äôt flattering. I was nervous about sizing and after reading the comments decided to go a size down. I ended up ordering a small, but the elastic band was a bit too loose. I‚Äôm sure this would be a plus for some, but the loose waist band and the poofy unflattering build of it ended up making me look larger than I am.<br /><br />For reference I am 5‚Äô7.5; 140lb; 27in Waist; 36in Hip<br /><br />Not bad material though, so 3 stars. I‚Äôm sure it will work for someone!"
3.0,"Beware: The color is absolutely not a red burgundy as pictured. It's more of a brownish deep purple, which I would call more of an eggplant color. I also didn't expect the black design on it to be a felt/velvet type material but it seems nicely constructed. It does tend to attract white lint in the wash though so be sure to put it in an all darks load. I'm a size 10 and the medium has a loose but fitted shape around the mid section, so I'd say the sizing is accurate. Doesn't show my bra on the sides either, so it also has nice coverage. It's an OK tank, just know that you're not getting burgundy and the design material is clingy and a little heavy for a work out shirt."
3.0,CHEAP Quality
3.0,Strings on the elastic are pulling out after only 6-8 washing. Would not purchase again.
3.0,"It shows every bump and roll, but it is comfortable.  I wear them as pjs"
3.0,This little wallet is good for what I needed it for.  Just a tiny pouch for my ID and credit cards.
3.0,"I want SO BADLY to like these. They‚Äôre made ‚Äúlocally‚Äù, I love the feel of the material, they look like great shorts, I love the colors, they feel like they‚Äôre well made, but the crotch is awkwardly long. I have a ton of work out shorts, and maybe 1 in 10 will have that awkwardly long crotch problem, and these are them."
3.0,The material is very thin. I also should have purchased this product one size smaller.
3.0,These are thin and soft so they feel like pajamas. So that is what they will be used for.
3.0,"Too short, shoulders ok but no give in material.  Just made skimpy.Seller was great about rectifying the situation and offering compensation."
3.0,they smelled HORRIBLE for at least 2 washes
3.0,Wasn't what I was expecting as the long straight earrings are just fabric strips. I thought they were plastic. The hoop earrings literally feel apart as I removed them from the package.
3.0,The shirt fits larger than I expected and the blue color is not represented well in the picture. The fabric is a bit stiff. I am returning this item.
3.0,Totally see-through however they are suuper soft and cut. I've decided to just use them under black shorts.
3.0,Came fast and looks nice but it had a few Mark's on it sadly. Otherwise I'd give 5 stars.
3.0,Purchased for and by my Brother
3.0,I should have ordered a small size
3.0,"These were so comfortable at first. Nice and snug, fit great. Then after about a week, they were loose and the bottoms are pretty flat. Pretty disappointed."
3.0,"The gloves are suppose to be rated to withstand -30 degrees, but I was just in Denver, CO this past weekend where the weather was (at its lowest) 25 degrees and my fingers were freezing. I attempted to answer my cell phone while wearing the gloves, but was unable to even slide the screen to answer. Other than that..., they look great."
3.0,"Might reorder again but xl was like xxl, might order a medium and usually I'm an xl or size 12"
3.0,Adorable bracelet..clasps are weak
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt the best quality and the buttons on the bottom feel as if they would fall off in one wrong pull.
3.0,Doesn't fill up fully and hat flops over
3.0,"Does not look like product, Fits a little small...gave to grand daughter. She wears as PJ bottoms."
3.0,"A friend is a big harry potter fan, so I got this for her. It was decent and pretty cool, but the picture is misleading. The wings aren't really that big, and the ball faces the other way. Not too pleased, but it was still decent."
3.0,Unfortunately all the rhinestones fell out rather quickly. It‚Äôs still cute though
3.0,"I like the size of the glasses, but the arms are not long enough."
3.0,The bag is top heavy & falls down on itself whuch makes it difficult to find things even though it has several divided pockets. The sidws needed to be reenforced to help keep it standing up
3.0,I bought these glasses originally at Dillards they broke so I found them on here . These glasses were to big and over sized I was so disappointed
3.0,Cute tank but very cheap. The strap broke the first time I tried it on. :-( Plastic hoop snapped
3.0,"Good quality; However, I wear a D cup and the coverage leaves some to be desired"
3.0,"This hat was way too tight for me, but fit one of my kids."
3.0,Adjustable in back as well so help's some
3.0,Very poorly made.  Not worth the money.
3.0,I was so excited to get the but very disappointed when I tried them on.  I followed the sizing chart but it didn't do any good.  I'm not sure where I went wrong but they are very loose on me so it doesn't give me the desired affect I was going for.  I can still use them as long as I'm wearing a long shirt or under a dress because the top looks ridiculous.
3.0,"it is okay, quality was good. Just wasnt what i expected. But if you like the design you will enjoy it,"
3.0,"Bought the 32‚Äù waist belt, my waist is at 31 or 32 and the belt is a bit small, after 2 weeks of wear, it is starting to stretch a bit which is a good sign."
3.0,It was great but came with a button already ripped off :(
3.0,Although it is adorable and the material feels great; the sizing is off. I bought two dresses. Same size but they are made in like two different sizes. One was like 2 sizes smaller than the other one. I ordered both larges. One I could wear and I could not even wear at all near my chest. Super cute but as a busty person that kind of sucked. Lots of flowy room in the body.
3.0,"Ad should state that this cap fits a STD 6"" sch40 & 80 pipe (maybe some others- cast iron,soil:  Polyethylene, IPS ??)  ID is 6 5/8"" not 6""...without defining the pipe type/schedule one could only assume the ID is, as stated,  6"".  It will not fit most types of 6 inch pipes."
3.0,The part that fits under the visor of the cap keeps falling down off my forehead
3.0,Lose stitching in shirt. My daughter wore it once because the stitching had become so pose it created holes.
3.0,The flowers were upside down
3.0,This felt incredibly cheap and ran more true very small. Loose threads everywhere.
3.0,Fit is small. Fabric doesn't have much give. I thought it would be softer.
3.0,I havent worn it yet...but its lovely .....shining gold  ..i received it in excellent condition....
3.0,"This is not my favorite sports bra, but it will work. It does a decent job of limiting bounce. Maybe I should have gone down one size for the best support, but I have another sports bra that fits the same and offers better support than this one does.<br /><br />For the price, this one is my second favorite that I own. The quality was not what I was expecting after reading a lot of the reviews. I honestly don't know why it got so many rave reviews. It's ok, but not great.<br /><br />Overall it's a good sports bra to have for when your favorite sports bra is in the wash, but I won't buy it again. I'll try a different one out next time."
3.0,I‚Äôm a little disappointed in the screen light. It‚Äôs a tiny bulb on one side unlike my original watch that had a fully lit screen. Difficult to see in the dark!
3.0,Fabric and style are great. Unfortunately ordered a coffee color received a light army green. In person is even greener.
3.0,Cute pattern but fabric not as high quality as others in its category.
3.0,"within one day of wearing this item, I bent down to pick up my son and it tore RIGHT where my crotch was. VERY embarrassing.<br /><br />Other than that, the look isn't bad! Actually a pretty cool pant, just sucks that it tears so easily"
3.0,Did not fit and does not seem true to size. Fabric is soft. The cut of the fabric around the rear was a little high. The shoulders didn‚Äôt seem to be cut right.
3.0,This product is very thin and snags easily. Its also a little to big around the shoulders and tends to slide off.
3.0,"Some shoppers may not like that these are thin.  I bought them for that very reason.  I have a medical exemption that a craft show I'm a part of will not honor so had to find something that wasn't mesh and was still classified as a mask.  This worked out.  I cut the flap off the bottom which was my plan from the beginning since it looks ridiculous and serves no purpose.<br />I am not happy about the stains which appear to be black sharpie marker.  If the material was prettier and no marker stains, this would easily be 5 stars."
3.0,Not a fan of these gaiters/masks.  The ear loops are very uncomfortable for me and the material covers way high up on your face.  Too high.  For being a thin layer gaiter the fit is just too snug and off for me.  But it is a personal preference with these things.
3.0,"I see so many of these ads that dont give much very good product discriptions, this was one of them."
3.0,Not a sweater<br />The title literally says sweater unfortunately this is just a long sleeve T-shirt that really should‚Äôve cost $12 but ‚Äòtis the season so up charges will happen
3.0,So I got a xxl and it was too small the size‚Äôs definitely not true I‚Äôm a xl in all my jackets and hoodies. But it feels and looks really cool. If you can find the right size you‚Äôll love it
3.0,Love the fit and looks sexy but it is see-through.  I expected to wear some pasties but now I'm going to have to figure something else out.
3.0,pretty but the material was strange.
3.0,This was cheaply made. The two sides aren‚Äôt the same length and it‚Äôs not long enough by a long shot.
3.0,"I am giving this dress 3 stars only because it runs so small.  The quality good and the dress itself is really cute.  I was so excited to receive this dress as I had ordered a similar one from Amazon and absolutely love it.  Unfortunately, as is common for clothing produced in China, it runs much smaller than expected.  I ordered a large, which is the size I have ordered in other dresses of similar construction and quality.  It was tiny!  I am 5 feet 3 inches tall and wear a size 10-12 in women's clothing.  It was extremely snug.  I gave the dress to my teeny daughter who is 5 feet tall and weighs 110 pounds.  It fits her perfectly - in a size large!  Aside from size, however, the dress is darling and my daughter loves it.  It is of decent quality and makes a great little summer dress.  Had it been a little larger, I would have loved it.  I would order again, but at 2-3 sizes larger than your typical clothing size."
3.0,eh. the print is cute. I bought them because I hate heels and thought they‚Äôd be a nice alternative but the fit is weird and they feel like cardboard on your feet.
3.0,These socks didn't work for me doing yoga so I decided to use them as slipper socks. They just kept on twisting and sliding off my feet when I was doing my yoga workout.
3.0,I do like the watch but it was hard to get the digit aspect of the watch to function.
3.0,"Chain is really long, so I had to cut it down a bit. Should be labeled""deer skull.""  kind of cheap metal but its decent."
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt look exactly like the pic but still cute.
3.0,This dress fits as expected except the holes are too small. Otherwise it's a nice looking dress!
3.0,"Looks so good, but snags so easy"
3.0,"I sew, so while I prefer the fit and materials of my own masks, it's good to have cheapie masks on hand for emergency use, shop customers, or family members who constantly lose their masks. These are a very good value, especially with the coupon, and they have soft earloop elastic and the little silicon adjusters, a nice touch. A couple lanyards are included as well.<br /><br />The fit is good on a small adult or kid's head. It doesn't sag and gape like disposable masks, and should give a better fit than those. The nose wire works pretty well and the ear loop elastic is softer than most cheapie masks. They're comfortable to wear for extended periods with the cotton side (plain black) on the inside. The problem, of course, is that the holiday print side, which you probably won't want to wear for the rest of the year, is polyester, and doesn't feel good against the skin, and might be bad if you're prone to breakouts. And of course a knit fabric is less effective at restricting germs than woven cotton, the CDC's recommended fabric.<br /><br /> But if you're using these in an environment with good ventilation and room to social distance, they're a good, economical choice for short-term wear. I personally couldn't wear the poly side against my skin all day, and I wouldn't feel confident in a knit mask with close contact. But they're certainly better than the single-layer knit masks you see and ill-fitting disposables.<br /><br />The Christmas dog one is super cute."
3.0,Looks good. The color of the shoe and headband do not match at all.
3.0,Material is not what I expected. I wanted it to be more flowy. I should have read the description better before ordering.
3.0,"I bought the Dri-Equip(tm)-ladies long sleeve moisture wicking athletic shirt to use as a pajama top during the winter. On the plus side,  the royal blue color is beautiful and holds up well even after washing.<br /><br />On the down side, I didn't feel that the material breathed well.  For instance, when I sweat in this shirt at night, the fabric felt so ""heavy"" that I had to remove it just to sleep comfortably."
3.0,I liked the design and pattern but absolutely hated the material. Was the same material as my daughters paw patrol pajama dress. Very cheap dress
3.0,Like color but silver is a little too thick for one of my ear lobes. Never had this issue before and been wearing earrings for at least 40 years.
3.0,"LOVE THE LOOK AND FEEL,BUT HALF THE SIZE AFTER WASH. DO NOT USE DRYER!!! GAVE TO FRIEND ."
3.0,I don't care much for the weird fabric.
3.0,Very thin material‚Äîenjoy the fit but very thin and see through.
3.0,Cute. But very short.
3.0,The Boots are not even water-resistant. If a company has to lie. I do not have high hope. Amendment  The company has offered to compensate me for the misinformation stay tuned for an update The company did make things right. don t buy boots if you walk through wet grass.
3.0,Once laundered it shrinks and needs to be ironed or sent to cleaner. Assume a good amount of shrinkage
3.0,"check the sizing guidelines. These runs smaller than the U.S. sizes. If you go clubbing, this is a perfect dress for you. It is short (wear decent undies) and you may show off more than you want. The tie up front is nice. It showcases your chest. Keep in mind that if your bust size is larger than 40 inches, none of these will fit."
3.0,Just a yellow tint
3.0,This is a little to small fir me and I didn't like the fabric either.
3.0,It looks like plastic and its not as nice as it is in person as to seeing it onsite. I wouldn't pay this price again.
3.0,The sizing chart is not true to US sizing. I would recommend selecting one size up from whatever you would normally select. I am normally a Medium shirt size and bra size 34C and I got the Medium and it''s tight. The material is very stretchy so i am hoping to stretch it by wearing it and I would not dare put it in the dryer. I would have got the Large instead.
3.0,The strap already fell apart
3.0,"The necklace didn't fit like a choker necklace and the pearl is much larger than in the photo, but it was pretty.  It looks nice when I wear it, but it definitely doesn't fit the way I expected it to as a choker."
3.0,too fragile
3.0,It's good but it's not flexible.
3.0,Item was smaller then i thought and chain was way too small. Made for a child more then an adult but i made it work by using the pendent to create a new necklace.
3.0,Nice but not as dressy as it appears
3.0,It‚Äôs a cute fitting dress and material is nice but it‚Äôs just not very flattering. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 140 lbs. Maybe I‚Äôm a little too short for this look. I‚Äôll add a picture when I‚Äôm able.
3.0,Works just fine but the color doesn't look like the description.
3.0,It‚Äôs really cute! But after a couple hand washing and the straps broke :(
3.0,"Very cute but I had to give up on wearing it because it wouldn't stay latched. But hey, it was only a clue bucks."
3.0,This shirt was long in length with a nice figure shape.  Fit is as expected.  The material has a crinkly feel; the reason I returned it.
3.0,"They're not that thick, actually quite thin material but they will do. Use them for my mother-in-law who has dementia. They would make great lobster bibs, though."
3.0,Very cute but smaller for 6 year olds
3.0,"Too large. Neckline plunges quite low. The dress is cute, I may try it in a smaller size."
3.0,"These baby shoes are great. They are easy to put on. They are soft and wide. They provide great grip for waterplay. They dry quickly... In terms of fit, my daughter wears a 3 (almost a 4) and the 12-18 month size fit great with just enough room to grow a bit without being too trippy.<br />BUT they are not going to hold up on concrete or other hard outdoor surfaces like pool decks and patios. After one use playing at the water table in the backyard the toes were all torn up. It's been a couple of weeks and her toes are poking through. We keep the table on a concrete slab. The slab is smooth and comfortable to walk on with your bare feet. That these shoes got all torn up on that slab tells me they are not going to last through normal toddler play. If you order these ot would be best to use them in grass or indoors."
3.0,"One pair had a sock with two large seams poking out on 1/3&#34; on each side at the toe seam. Very uncomfortable in a shoe. Usually these have good quality, but one of two pair I bought was not good. Expensive socks should have better quality control."
3.0,Cute shirts just order up a size
3.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but runs small. I would size up. I bought a medium and had to buy a large.  It is also thin and kind of see through. I would wear it with a slip. I bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She loves it!"
3.0,"I do like this apron, but I feel like it probably won't last long. The stitching on it is not very good. The first one I ordered had defective stitching to the point where the pockets had holes. It was replaced, however I wouldn't recommend buying this item."
3.0,"The sweater was cute and fit (I got a small I think and I'm 5'6, 140lbs) but the fit is nothing like the picture. It's knitted so the style doesn't fall/drape as I was hoping. Sizing up would not fix the problem since it was more the material than style."
3.0,"The material is a bit see-through. I sized up, the top is still a bit tight and the bottoms are really long. My normal size is a M and I got a L"
3.0,The shirt has a very boxy feel to it the bottom is completely straight across and for some reason it just doesn't sit right on my body. I wish it fit a little more fitted.  The fabric is also a little stiff.
3.0,Excellent maternity dress
3.0,"The clasp has Tous bear shape, so pendants with small ring wont fit onto the choker"
3.0,Just felt like they didn‚Äôt bend well to my arm . One broke in half . They are nice just not comfortable to me .
3.0,Buckle broke off pretty quickly
3.0,Lite wasn't bright enough
3.0,"I like the pattern and the style, but I don't like that I was unable to order the top and bottom sizes separately. The medium bottoms fit great, but there's no way I can wear the top, it's too small! I have a 34D chest and spill out of the top"
3.0,"The spanks in them feels like less then 10% becouse I bought some other ones earlier and they were 8% ad feel tighter, and they bag out an are to long"
3.0,A little tight but nice fabric.
3.0,"These are adorable, but would only be knee high if you are a tiny person. They are more like crew socks on my 11 year old. But she loves them, anyway."
3.0,"very cute, but it's thin. don't expect a thick lanyard with the clip that can be removed. my badge has multiple cards on it and a badge reel and this thin lanyard is feeling the weight."
3.0,"I got these earrings for my sister and she loves them.  They're cute, but they're cheap and are therefore not high quality.  For the price though, they've seemed to hold together pretty well."
3.0,Love it but the 6 month size fit way too small on my baby and she's 2 months old lol. She's 12lbs and 23 inches.
3.0,"Nice suit, but I got the wrong size."
3.0,Too cute. Not to wear on a windy day
3.0,"Cheap, works but need to becareful because plastic slides and moves easily"
3.0,"Wish it has been a tad bit smaller. Maybe make an extra small size. I'm 5'1"" and about 120 pounds."
3.0,"Ehh.. Kinda disappointed.. The sleeves aren't as baggy as they are in the image, so it makes you look like you're just wearing a poncho. But it still fits cute."
3.0,looks good. Got it for a friend who is a deputy. Would have got a 5 star if the embroidery was as large as another hat I ordered previously
3.0,"When I bought these socks, the item page said it included 12 PAIRS.  I received only 6 pairs.  The package said it was a 12 PACK.  Is it intentionally misleading or simply a mistake?  I thought I was buying 12 PAIRS because that is what it said.  Could this be a bait and switch tactic?<br />Overall, I like the socks.  They seem well made."
3.0,Kept falling out. The little rubber band pops off too easily. Bought them for work.
3.0,They lose their fluff after like a week
3.0,"The band is cute and comfortable., but not wearing well.  The spots are already rubbing off.  I‚Äôve caught the edge if the band a couple of times, on a box or something, and it‚Äôs popped open.  It stays buckled fine under normal circumstances though."
3.0,"Great hat, but somewhat small."
3.0,poor sewing job have to have someone fix the reflective tape it was falling off the back side
3.0,"Very cute flattering style. But it's a disposable dress... specifically the fabric is sheer. Will be cute as a swimsuit cover up or one time use. Just keep in mind if it's snug at all, you'll be able to see skin underneath"
3.0,I ordered this black and white hat but when i recieved it in the mail it was black and green. I ended up kind of liking it but dont like the fact i paid for something and recieved something different.
3.0,"The right size jacket sleeve seam had not been stitched around the sleeve strap. The jacket fit exactly as I expected. I need 37&#34; arm length in my shirts and the jacket fits my arm length great! The rest of the jacket appeares to be made well. over all appearance is stylish and light weight. If the jacket wasn't what I was looking for I would have sent it back. It's worth the extra money to have the sleeve repaired. I use my jacket has a business casual blazer. It looks great with tie, sweaters, open shirt and jeans."
3.0,I like the belt but the color of the brown belt and the coffee belt were the same color - more of a dark tan. I can't use it for the outfit I bought it for. The delivery took almost 8 weeks.
3.0,"Runs small, need to buy a size up"
3.0,The fabric is a little cheap. It looks better than it really is.
3.0,Neck was a little tight. I actually cut it out and love the shirt now.
3.0,The picture is prettier than the actual dress.. I‚Äôd say purchase a size smaller. I look like I have drapes wrapped around my body
3.0,"These seem pretty nicely crafted, but the two plugs I received differ a lot in color. I know natural plugs will have some variation, but these don‚Äôt look remotely similar when worn. Not the end of the world, but would definitely would have preferred a more closely matched set."
3.0,The set was cute but sized more of a girls XL than womens.
3.0,"It is made well, and it may be my fault and I missed the description, but it is very tiny."
3.0,"The dress fit amazing and is stretchy , the top part was trash came in with holes but the sewing work was garbage and the strings were loose !!!"
3.0,"Top is large, bottom were to short for me. Normally i am size M, ordered S and top was still to big, but bottom was to short. I am 5'7'' and around 150 lb. Had to return it."
3.0,"Buckles scratch bad, but the product will not fall apart."
3.0,Smaller than I expected.  I do have a big head though
3.0,Size is too small for a medium.
3.0,"I cannot get the clasp to release. I press down, I jiggle, I push n pull...<br />I said bad things...  It just will not release.<br />I broke a nail.<br />But I bought 24 inch, so it just goes around my whole head.<br />I'm ok now"
3.0,"The watch is nice, but there's a big problem with the band for people with smaller wrists. The first inch of the band is very stiff, so it won't wrap around my wrist comfortably. Another issue with the band is the clasp has somewhat sharp edges that makes an indentation on my wrist. I end up returning this watch and got a version that has a silicon band that was much better, although the clasp is the same so the problem persist in that part of the watch."
3.0,Fit is much smaller than expected. Fabric is very soft.
3.0,"Nice quality, colors are very neon (depends on your taste), more of a ""no show"" sock than a ankle fit."
3.0,"Nice pants, but the cargo pocket zippers broke on both sides the first time they were worn. I mended them, but they don't work properly, so really the pockets can't be used. I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"Good glasses for the price, and they read well, but the sides come off really easily.  It looks like the screw could be replaced but who has time for that?  I'd like a little more durability."
3.0,Not exactly what I expected for the price. Material is ok at best. The pockets are fake. Disappointed.
3.0,"they do what they are made to do, hold pictures."
3.0,The picture isn‚Äôt the same
3.0,Runs small and buttons gap.
3.0,Cute but the torso on the romper is too short. It rides up when you walk. Im a short person so I might give this to my little sister who is even shorter
3.0,I returned these as they were not flattened as described.  Probably just a packing error.
3.0,"I didn't expect these to be like pantyhose, nor did I expect them to rise up to barely above my knee. I have slim but shapely legs and the socks will go above my knee, but its literally a stretch and makes them no longer opaque. Also, they roll down if they're stretched. However, they are soft and comfortable, but its pantyhose material."
3.0,This fit perfect on top but the shorts were too small and pinched my waist.  They have an oddly tight waistband that doesn't lay flat and isn't really flattering.  The fabric is quite sheer and in light colors will show a little too much when wet.
3.0,Shows off every cellulite
3.0,"I know I‚Äôm a small person, but this dress was far too long and big for a size small. It was beautiful and well made, but did not fit as expected at all. If you‚Äôre looking for a similar dress in a smaller size, Shein has it."
3.0,I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard to find one of these that fit. It‚Äôs either puffed up on top of my head or hanging over my eyes‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs warm though
3.0,Love the screw but it unscrewed and fell out within a week
3.0,It was way too big! And I'm usually a lg/Xlg and I didn't have enough time to mend it... Since my other costume didn't fit (different vent.) the costume came before the est. Date! And though it really thin cloth! And cheaply put together... I was able to wear a romper type under for warmth and to conceal bra and undies... Yep the costume is that see-through! If you buy this costume maybe mid-lenght peatcoat would add shape and coverage for your undies...
3.0,"Reading the reviews I bought a size up, way too big. Just order your normal size"
3.0,I wanted to love this necklace because it's so cute. Unfortunately it is not good quality and left a rash and greenish circle on my neck.
3.0,Not bad just thin...
3.0,"I‚Äôm giving three stars for the fact that the seller sent a replacement immediately. However, the first jackets patch was extremely crooked, so I requested an exchange which happened immediately (shipping is slow but it did arrive at the earliest projected date). I received the replacement today (12-11-21) and was ecstatic that the patch looked great. After going over it to make sure everything was good I noticed I received the wrong size, a medium‚Ä¶.I ordered an extra small. I will be requesting a third exchange but this jacket cost a lot of money to be this much trouble."
3.0,The plastic adjuster tends to pinch. üò¢
3.0,"The case itself is all right. It is semi-hard, fits my own fit over sunglasses, and comes with a wipe. The color is just as pictured and could fit your own sunglasses if they fit the measurements posted here. HOWEVER, the fit over glasses arrived broken,  missing a screw. They could not be used or fixed. Not pleased with the fit over glasses but satisfied with the case."
3.0,"Was going to use this for pumpkin picking outing but it is really wide for a small. It fits really loose like Maybe it's a large? I took photo with a size small loose fitting pajama on top of it to show size difference. The fabric is really soft so It will end up as a PJ, it is too loose for wearing as a tunic."
3.0,a little tight and the kangroo pockets were awkward.
3.0,Returned product too small.
3.0,The bottoms are giant! Huge and saggy. Look like the were mde to fit over three regular diapers. No way they will ever fit a 3T. Top is perfect and bow is cute.
3.0,"This sunglasses looks cheap and feels cheap. That's good for teenagers. You won't feel heart-broken if they lose it or break it. I was originally getting this sunglasses for my wife for car-driving only. Attracted by the fashion style, my teenager daughter took it instead. The large lens work well in protecting eyes from glare.<br /><br />Not sure about UV protection capability. I don't see any claim or statement about it's UV protection capability. Kind of weird not seeing this information for a sunglasses.<br /><br />All in all, in the price range, this is an OK sunglasses, not much to brag about."
3.0,"The look of these is very nice. The style reminds me of the IC Berlin frames at my local eye doctor. However, there is a reason those cost 10 times more. The metal of these does feel strong like spring steel, but one of the arms is slightly bent and I don‚Äôt think it would withstand bending it back far enough to make it straight. I tried, but because it is spring steel, it just stays in place. The polarization of the lenses is also very minimal. They are definitely polarized, but not like more expensive sunglasses. They are very lightweight and comfortable so that is a good part about them. I don‚Äôt know that they are worth $59, but they might surprise me over the years and last longer than some of my more expensive sunglasses."
3.0,"Not the material I was expecting, but still cute."
3.0,"Was a pretty dress but if you are large chested, it will not fit.  Fabric was wonderful"
3.0,I love the color and pattern on these shorts. They were a little puffy in the lower belly. Like the way shorts get if you wear them in the water. Maybe I need to go down one size. I ordered XL . I'm 5'5 190 . I carry most of my weight on my belly4
3.0,"Nothing special, just a regular shoe horn. Does what it supposed to do. It doesn't feel to strong, might break in future. But so far does it's job.<br />I wish the handle was a little bit longer. I'm ok with the length, but I can see how my husband is struggling with larger size hands and shoes."
3.0,"Arrived fast, looks nice, but she had an allergic reaction to this product...."
3.0,Really cute top and shorts but top so long can only see lace of shorts. I will have to shorten the top by 3-4&#34;.
3.0,"Fabric was beautiful but the stitching came undone at the waistband the first time i wore it, considering returning it."
3.0,Big in the waist
3.0,over priced even for Marvel merchandise. Knitting on inside catches on toes when trying to put on.
3.0,"Mixer reviews for this product:<br />+<br />. the lining is the comfiest thing ever, so soft!!<br />. the pants are thick enough that you're literally insulated from outside temperature (not too cold, not too hot even in windy conditions)<br />. The outside fabric is also great quality<br /><br />-<br />. Ok so the shape is weird, it's a bit baggy /puffy on the crouch while skinny on legs. Definitely size up if you want to feel comfy!<br />. MAIN ISSUE: the finish is of very poor quality! The pants reaps apart at the seams after 1 wash only! The stitching comes off making the sherpa visible at the seams. I have already returned one, and received an exchange very fast. The quality was a bit better but it still came apart :/<br /><br />Verdict: perfect to stay at home with for the winter ; poor attention to details/stitching"
3.0,Dress was too small and tight
3.0,Very cute outfit with detail but would suggest sizing up!
3.0,"Overall, glasses work well indoors. Purchased for additional safety measures around workplace during Covid outbreaks. Glasses do not fog but retain moisture from breathing in humid South. I did accidentally drop them outdoors. They did scratch."
3.0,You definitely sweat with this. I would recommend purchasing a size or 2 less than your normal size. It does stretch some after a couple of uses.
3.0,The print is adorable. The fabric is soft but see through. You will need a slip or cami underneath. My biggest issue is the length. I am 5'2&#34; and 125lbs. I got a small and it is way too short to wear as a dress. If i lift my arms just a little it goes way up over my bottom. It fits everywhere else and is cute enough I will keep it as a tunic.
3.0,"Well I got the black ones with the white on top, and the grey looking ones (which are more blue in person), but my other pair is some sort of brown from top to bottom."
3.0,"Fit my 2 yr old fine, the bow however is HUGE. Way to big of a bow for a toddler."
3.0,Nice but ran small
3.0,"Well, the infant was small at birth, so it was too big when she needed it for the cold weather. The quality was good."
3.0,"I absolutely love the frames! However, I ordered 1.5 for the readers magnification, and the frame I like the most, was sent with the wrong magnification. (it came as a 3!) not sure how to replace, will I need to send all 3 back to get the correct one?"
3.0,The product is of high quality. I wish they fit. At 5'8 they are too long and useless to me. I may be returning them
3.0,Skulls don't line up.... bottom one in an inch to the left
3.0,I did not realize that the string connects the entire shirt.. I didn‚Äôt see that in the picture when I ordered it but the string literally connects all four corners of the shirt
3.0,"This buckle didn't hold up to 2 months of light use in an office environment. I have a Dragon buckle made by the same manufacturer that held up to the abuse of a factory environment. Perhaps the rivet failure isn't common with these, but is a disappointment. Obviously I am past the return period, or I would return this for one that works and hopefully holds up longer. If I get another failure, I will find a different manufacturer/vendor altogether."
3.0,"Nice hoodie but I saw some review saying to go 2X for 6' 210 lbs. ummm, not necessary. It's a big loose cut of a hoodie to begin with but they're nice and comfy. I'm sure a size smaller would be fine for humans that size."
3.0,They were pretty good for the price
3.0,"I loved this bracelet when I received it. It's beautiful and has a nice heavy substaintial feel to it, however after only wearing it a handful of times, the pin that holds the hinge and each side of the bracelet together started to come out and bent. Now I can't get it back in and the bracelet is starting to fall apart. I tried taking it to a jeweler to fix but they said that a special machine is needed to fix it. I'm bummed because I really liked this piece but now can no longer wear it."
3.0,Nice shirt for money<br />But description says cuffed it is not cuffed at all<br />Had it been cuffed it would have been 4 stars
3.0,"I think the ring looks great but because it's ""two rings in one"" it's really tight. My finger is a size 6 but I guess I need a size 6.5 or 7 for it to have a better fit. I have to take it off at night because it cuts off the circulation to my finger. I do get a ton of compliments on it but I would only suggest it to someone with small fingers or to wear it as a necklace."
3.0,"It was very exciting to get this beautiful piece. I have to tell you the large lapis stone fell out immediatly. Not a problem for me because I had the knowledge and the right glue to fix it, others may not... Thank you for the timely delivery..."
3.0,"it is a nice looking ring. the stone is a nice size too. the only complain is the side of the ring rubs on my other finger, which can make it a little uncomfortable. but over all it is Nice."
3.0,"Very surprised when we got our delivery.  When I opened the box, I found that we had received 12 hats!  Rather than one.  Looked at the website again to verify the price and quantity.  I verified that I only ordered one and there was no information indicating that there would be 12 hats per order.  Please provide feedback on wether or not I received these extra hats by mistake or was the purchase price of @24.95 included all 12 hats ."
3.0,"Nice watch, stylish. Keeps fairly accurate time. What one would expect for a watch under $50.00. My watch came from their factory in China. The rotor for the automatic wind was not attached and the screw for it was missing. I use the watch as a manual wind. Despite the problems in quality control, I like my watch. It is what it is for under $50.00."
3.0,I‚Äôm a 14 jean but XL was way too small‚Ä¶
3.0,"It was larger than I thought it would be from the description, but at least it was inexpensive. You get what you pay for."
3.0,The reason why I gave this three stars is because the material is not great. It is a cute suit but does not look the best on my body type.
3.0,Very solidly built but the smaller one came broken and nothing I could do about it. Didnt even want to deal with all the return stuff. If both had been functional I would easily give 5 stars.
3.0,"The shorts foe perfect, but the shirt keeps rolling up. I ordered an XL. I didn't send it back, so I just sleep in them ü•∞"
3.0,"Super short. Had to wear it below my hips, but it worked for my costume!"
3.0,Loose fitting rubber boot. Fits the job of keeping your feet dry when out in the muck. Very affordable.
3.0,"very pretty, and the silver is definitely not fake, but these are really hard to get on and off, bent one trying to get it out.  I would buy from this company anytime, but not infinity earrings.... from anywhere!"
3.0,Cotton fabric feels like a stiff sheet...even washing with fabric softener didn‚Äôt help much. Armholes a little small for size of gown.
3.0,Need to order 2 sizes above your normal size
3.0,Cards barely fit inside the slots. Can‚Äôt fit more than one per slot. Can‚Äôt put flimsy cards like business cards in the slots because while jamming them in there they fold up. Everything else is great.
3.0,"For the price, I suppose they‚Äôre fine but I have a similar pair from Gap that I love that fit way better; although admittedly they cost 3x the price.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù ish about 190 and bought a Large. They are snug, which I prefer but fit way tighter than the name brand pair I own.<br /><br />The waist band isn‚Äôt great, I like a firm high waist to hold the goods in, this is medium hold at best and not quite high enough to stay in place. The band has nothing keeping it in place, it rolls down frequently just a bit. Not a deal breaker necessarily because it‚Äôs comfortable in a non restricting way, but if I were to rely on these to exercise in, which I certainly DO NOT there‚Äôs no way I would feel secure. I keep my ever present camisole tucked into them to make me feel more put together.<br /><br />The length is also a touch shorter than my other pair, enough to be noticeable. I didn‚Äôt return them, they‚Äôll be fine, just not a dupe for my other pair. I love the color, the stretch, and the fabric is decent quality. Just the fit is off for me. I won‚Äôt buy another pair but worth a shot."
3.0,I REALY like the color and camo design it is the perfect size. It came on time. Both side small side compartment zippers were sprung and broke off  in my hand when I tried to zip  it closed
3.0,This is such a cute little necklace and I love it. Just it started to tarnish after 1 time of wearing it. A little disappointing.
3.0,The sleeves are exceptionally long...love the style though
3.0,I liked it but I didn‚Äôt love it. The fabric reminds me of the fabric from a child‚Äôs Halloween costume. Lots is static
3.0,These headbands are good if you like to wear them on your forehead.  I was looking for something to hold my hair back and these are a little too wide to wear that far back on your head and behind the ears.  The fleece lining is really soft.  I will wear these on windy or cool days when I need something to keep my ears warm.
3.0,"These are good shorts, I also ordered the Pearl Izumi quest shorts and I like those better, I do like how these ones don't have the tight constriction around the thigh, and the padding on these ones aren't as good as the pearl but they're totally sufficient"
3.0,It's shiny huge piece. Not delicate the way I expected.
3.0,While it‚Äôs cute<br />It‚Äôs not as luxe or luxurious as I expected
3.0,"Did not find the quality of cotton as good as the last time I purchased Hanes cotton briefs. Very thin and cut smaller. I read the reviews before purchasing so I purchased a size larger than I usually get and so glad I did. Briefs were cut smaller than last purchased same brand, same brief."
3.0,I like the quality & look of this Tie Die but it came too big & I will have to send it back & get a size that fits.
3.0,It has 2 buttons missing had to return i
3.0,Cute but boxy. Not fitted as shown.
3.0,"While it is the picture and I love it, however I was a little disappointed by the quality... it literally seemed like someone just cut a piece of fabric into underwear shape. No seams on the legs or waist only on the sides, im honestly scared to wear them solely cause I don't know if they'll fall apart if I wash them..."
3.0,Overall decent for the price but several sizes are missing pieces
3.0,but its not soo warm i can feel the cold weather in my back not good
3.0,"I have a few pairs of Pettipants,. these are somewhat large and only come just below the knee which is fine. I suggest going 1 or 2 sizes smaller they run large. But still feel and look great."
3.0,liked adjustable waist.  Weird tag iron on logo has me questioning if theses are knock off Lands End
3.0,The two bows are really adorable. The gift box would have been cute except for the big made in China sticker and the big barcode sticker that make it absolutely useless.
3.0,Good quality but runs wide and long
3.0,"These grease protectors were not as durable as we thought, my grandson has to wear two to make them durable."
3.0,One of ours fell apart shortly after receiving it.
3.0,A little too short for me.5' 11&#34;. Otherwise they are great!
3.0,"A little tight in sleeves, but fits well everywhere else. Good buy as far as price."
3.0,"Ordered large, fits like a small, sleeves too short"
3.0,"I‚Äôm 109 lb, petite frame girl, I ordered size small and it was too big for me. Unfortunately, i had to return it. I wish it came in x-small size."
3.0,"I ordered a large according to reviews, I'm 5'3 145 lbs and the large fit me a bit loose, too big around the breast area, I'm a 34dd"
3.0,Much smaller then I was hoping it‚Äôs not long and flowy... maybe if I were a child
3.0,"Not very comfortable, they slip off at times."
3.0,"It came on time, I normally wear a medium but ordered a small, it was still too big, the fabric is too stretchy, i felt like i was wearing a child‚Äôs dress. I gave it to a friend."
3.0,Fits small - I am a size 6 / medium typically and ordered a large based on reviews... fits like a small. Wanted to wear as a swim cover up but too tight. It is see through but as I was going to use over a swimsuit that isn‚Äôt an issue for me but the fit is. 5‚Äô6‚Äù 135lbs for reference
3.0,"I felt the shirts were very tight fitting at the seems, especially the chest area and that‚Äôs not usually an issue for me."
3.0,Looks like costume jewelry
3.0,"Perfect vest.  Has one flaw, the front zipper closes from the left instead of the right like all men zippered vest, jackets, coats."
3.0,"When I first opened the items it was really cute. However you have to be really careful because the feathers come off so easily when getting them out of the package and opening them up. I had 3 big feathers come off and didn‚Äôt really care. It wasn‚Äôt until I put them on when you can see 3 bald spots on the wings so I had to hot glue them back on. Throughout the day I kept losing some more feather. The halo was durable  for me I had no problem with that, stayed on my head just fine. I do wish the wings were a little bigger."
3.0,Fits good.go down one size to maximize the compression. I‚Äôm not a fan of how the wrist area/cuffs were large and so loose and for that reason I am returning . Everything else for great just not for me
3.0,"they get the job done, but its very difficult to hold onto the glass and porcelain dishes while soapy."
3.0,the lights are activated by the child just walking. the button is pressed by regular use and should be in a different place. color and lights are spectacular.
3.0,Loved the design and style but Didn't feel like it was made of quality material.
3.0,"The socks fit as expected according to the size chart for a 3 year old average boy.  The socks did have an unusual odor so much so I tried to refresh them in the dryer with dryer sheets, which did not work well enough and caused pilling.  I will have to wash them. They feel very nice. I let you know what happens when they are washed in a  cold water wash."
3.0,"While the quality seems okay, they run small (assuming I was shipped a medium, there is no sizing on them).  Therefore, I had to return them."
3.0,Too big; too high (setting) which makes them appear fake.  I prefer a smaller stone with a lower setting.  Quick shipping.
3.0,This was a bit small for my husband wrist.
3.0,"This jacket is very lightweight, and the white jacket is basically see-through. I received the large size, but it fits more like a medium size. It's slim cut through the torso and waist, so it doesn't fit me there even though I can often wear a men's Medium jacket. The jacket isn't really water resistant, and I wouldn't choose to wear it in a rain or even a sprinkle. It isn't really a wind breaker, either, since there is mesh venting along your sides and down the sleeves, plus large vent holes in the back. The inside fabric is a mesh, while the outside fabric is a slick, thin fabric. Both are made of 100% polyester. There are two front pockets that zip closed. There is a hood that is rolled up along the neck which you can unzip and remove when needed. There is a double zipper in the front so you can partly unzip both down and up. This jacket wasn't really what I was expecting from the description.<br /><br />Care instructions: Machine wash cold, permanent press cycle, non-chlorine bleach only, line dry if needed, do not iron, do not dry clean."
3.0,Great looking helmet but there are no cut outs for your ears. I cant where my head phones with the helmet on or it hurts my ears. Good helmet for the price I paid. $70.00. But i probably wouldnt purchase it again.
3.0,My kids are age 4 and 7 and this set is way too large for their hands and head. These are better suited for an adult. The hat is squished in shipping and hard to reshape.
3.0,"they looked as expected, but were quite stiff, tight and, oddly, sharp around the edges. they'd be far too painful to break in, so I skipped on these."
3.0,The sleeve size did not match up to the size of the rest of the shirt.
3.0,"This is cut like a box, no tapering for female body. Im 5.2 125 pound. The back drop is longer then the front. Tried similar sweater from diff vendors.  Grey from this vendor...other vendor lavender. This vendors version is lighter weight , cheaper feel. Note the quality in the material, sleeve construction in comparison sweater. This grey sweater sleeve length fit well, but the body was huge. The lavender sweater quality was much much better, but twice as huge (if the other vendor had xxs-would have bought it) returning both!"
3.0,This dress had a tear in the side seam so I returned it.  The fabric is really shiny and unique (you will either love it or hate it).
3.0,"The reviews were correct in saying buy a size larger. I bought a size larger and glad I did because it fits perfect. However, the model must be short. I am 5'8&#34; and the bottom is about 3 inches above my ankles. The zipper is very cheap so be careful. Overall it's cute so I will just wear heels to carry off the length; and zip slowly üëç"
3.0,This dress has flimsier fabric that has a cheaper feel than the other dress designs from Oxiuly.
3.0,Ing is disappearing after only wearing it a few times.
3.0,I wear them at work and in mask required establishments
3.0,Maybe others will like.  I returned.  However this company puts out some great earrings and other jewelry.  I have several outstanding pieces.
3.0,Its a great piece. But runs long.  I would suggest to go for a size down.
3.0,It wasn't sewn with quality. The band just fell or came apart on the first night I wore it.
3.0,"For the price, these serve my purpose. I like fingerless gloves for winter driving. The mitten-like cover is way too long (and I have long fingers). I would return these if I had intended to wear them other than for driving."
3.0,"since no one else will, ill say that they suck. havnt messured them yet but the o rings it came with where ripped."
3.0,Thought this would be easier to hold a few card and cash. A few of the slots are hard to get credit cards out. Can't hold too much cash as I get afraid of it sliding out. I think i go back to a normal wallet.
3.0,"Tried to wear it today. Can't put it on. Gave up , have to try again with more time"
3.0,I didn‚Äôt like the way it fit my breast
3.0,"Cute print, ok quality for the price,, but runs small"
3.0,Ran a little big. Heavier fabric than I expected. Otherwise it's okay.
3.0,"Awkward arches. I feel like a badass in them and the quality is amazing in them, but the arches feel ""off"" and make my feet hurt after a few hrs"
3.0,"I returned. This was huge on me, and more like a dress."
3.0,"I wear 8.5 shoes, so I bought these sandals in 8.5. As you can see in the picture, the width fits, but the length is too long."
3.0,"Nice timepiece. Looks great, keeps very accurate time. However,it‚Äôs solar powered and won‚Äôt charge beyond medium, has never gotten a full charge. It‚Äôs been in the window in the sun for over a week and still on M. And that lasts about 2 weeks before ‚Äúlow battery‚Äù warning comes on. I realize it‚Äôs winter and may not get as much  sun as the summer, but......<br />Very disappointed in that aspect of the watch! This is my 3rd Casio and the first one that I‚Äôve had this problem with."
3.0,"The red dress with white polka dot dress bleeds like crazy.  It will become a red dress with pink polka dots.  Definitely wash it separately.<br /><br />The fit is great but the button holes are very stretchy so if you have larger lady parts, you will have a huge gap.  I like the dress enough that I will go buy something to keep it closed but keep that in mind if you're considering this dress.<br /><br />The fabric seems to be summer friendly but is heavy enough that it hangs well off the body and moves nicely when you walk and spin.  It's not a stretchy fabric and won't lose it's shape.  It is not a lined dress so if you're concerned about that you'll also want to get yourself a slip."
3.0,"I love the pattern on this top. I usually wear an XL which on the loose side without looking like I'm swimming in my scrubs. After reading reviews, I sized up and ordered an XXL. What a mistake. The top is massive. It looks like a maternity top on me. I'm not very busty, so maybe that's why others say to size up. If you're like me, a proud member of the itty bitty committee, I would suggest ordering your normal size."
3.0,"Received it on time, the red bead is not red, its orange, the green and mistletoe charms are very pretty. WIll go ahead and give it as present."
3.0,I love the look of this purse but its very stiff.  Still trying to break it in a bit.
3.0,"I love the style of these, but I was disappointed to find that they're a bit small on me. They stop about 2/3 of the way up my calf and never manage to reach the knee. I do have wide feet, but the actual foot of the sock fits fine, so I assumed this wouldn't be a problem. I'll make sure I buy socks sized for adults only next time, rather than teens/adults."
3.0,"It comes with only a pin holding the springy bit together. That pin fell out on day one. Luckily I keep every piece of hardware I see. So with some drill bits, a new bolt, and intuitive fudgery it'll likely hold up real good now.<br /><br />Has a decent amount of gravity to it, the ring is small but perfect for my few keys and keeps them up off my knees while i'm driving.<br /><br />The clip is great to fidget with, good force from the spring, and the noise it makes is in that sweet spot of annoying to anyone not making it.<br /><br />2 Stars off for unexpected DIY but an otherwise fabulous product."
3.0,"I like the watch, but the strap is so short it makes it uncomfortable."
3.0,Really cute but turned quickly and leaves green on skin.
3.0,"I have sensitive skin and these are itchy around my neck, it's just like gym short material."
3.0,Cute ‚Äî good fit but later Feel as if they are sluding down
3.0,El anillo tiene buena presentaci√≥n (hasta ahora)‚Äù espero que llev√°ndolo en mi dedo me de la suerte de la cual cuenta su leyenda.
3.0,"They came efficiently, theyre not as cute in person and they fall apart easily. But they were cheap so"
3.0,"I purchased this dress after falling in love with the iconic tie waist dress. This dress has the same material, which is easy to hand wash and hangs dry well. The fit was a bit tighter and more form fitting then I expected. I am pear shape and it did highlight my curves in a flattering way. I still wear it, but I always wear a cardigan on top of it. Im 5‚Äô7‚Äù and this dress barely touches my knees. I wish it was a few inches longer in length. Overall a fine dress I was just looking for a bit more length and a slightly looser fit."
3.0,For me I feel like I should‚Äôve went a size up.
3.0,"This Alloro Men's Date Quartz Analog Wrist Watch is not bad. Visually, it looks really nice, though it is on the low end of watches. So far, it appears to be working okay and keeps time."
3.0,"Larger than I had imagined. Very soft, beautiful color"
3.0,I am disappointed in the color of this purse.  I ordered the Red-M and it looks ORANGE.  My favorite color is a wine color and was hoping on something near that in color or a red would be okay.  I ordered Red-M and would be happy with that but this purse is ORANGE!  It is still a nice purse though.
3.0,The colors does not display like in the picture. It‚Äôs darker and looks cheap.
3.0,I expected more of a knit-type fabric
3.0,"Not very good tummy support, see thru material and different color than expected"
3.0,I like it but it fits small. I got an xl and it doesn't fit like an xl.
3.0,Fits nice and quality good just takes work getting it situated right for you to put it on but like it
3.0,"These are for the look, not function.  They are tinted so they may provide some level of reducing glare but it's not enough that I would say they reduce glare.  That being said they are cute and fun to pair with different outfits.  The pink color is flattering on a range of skin types and adds a nice pop of color.  They are metal and plastic so be wary of leaving them somewhere they can heat up and melt (car dash)"
3.0,It is exactly as described but not quite as picture suggests
3.0,I love the design. However this ring tur ed my finger green in less than 8hrs.
3.0,"The hat is nice, seems to be of good quality. My only concern is the deep crease down the center of the foam brim from shipping. There was plenty of room for this to be shipped flat, but instead it was folded down the center."
3.0,Nice teal color and fits ok but longer than pictured. Looks mass produced so the quality is not the best. It shouldn't be called a bolero.
3.0,I am giving this three stars because I ordered navy blue and the dress is more a blue/green. It is comfortable but a bit thin. I'll keep it because the color isn't bad (even though it's not what I ordered) and wear it with a sweater or scarf.
3.0,"I have to agree with the previous review. The bag is gorgeous, I get compliments all the time, but you have to be extra careful when you pick it up because the long strap can disconnect from either end and the hardware catapults near the eyes and face every time. I will write to Lipault as well, a bag this expensive shouldn‚Äôt have such design flaw."
3.0,Ok product. Good size for all glasses. I wasn't so impressed with color or price after I got them. But I'm keeping for my larger glasses.
3.0,I got these because the price was amazing.... sadly they were so very tight so I think they run a tad small
3.0,Bought these for an 11 year old. Didn't fit way too small.
3.0,"I love the colors of this top, but it is a bit thin and a little tight."
3.0,"Initially, the shirt looked wonderful.  It fit tight, but not choking tight.  I'm 5'11 and 204 pounds, 34"" waist.  When we initially washed it, the blue dye ran all over the shirt.  It took a second washing to get it out, and I'm a bit leery about washing it again.  It does seem like a well made shirt and will give it a chance.  Time will tell."
3.0,"the material is great, the color is just as the photo however I got a medium (always wear a medium) and cant zip anywhere on my waist, high or low. It's more a small fit. I will be returning."
3.0,"These did not fit very well. They are not adjustable. When I put the item on my face, there were gaps on the sides and the bottom. I mean a decently large gap. I would have to wear a surgical mask and this to get a good fit.<br />Might work if you have a wider face. I have a small face so they didn't work."
3.0,My boyfriend loved it but I thought it looked cheap
3.0,She liked it but it broke when she opened it the first time.
3.0,"The color pattern is beautiful and it‚Äôs super comfy, but it‚Äôs not long like in the picture. Manufacturers have to remember that you have to add MORE length to plus size dresses, to make up for the difference the big girl fluff takes up in the middle. We want our dresses to hang long just like our thinner and more petite sisters."
3.0,"Good quality but sizing is misleading. Ordered a 5-6 and when I open it, it was marked 5-6t."
3.0,"Pretty and well made, but delicate with a very thin chain. The leaf is also very large, so it's not great for someone who likes dainty or understated jewelry."
3.0,"Nice coat, but the US XL is not really the right US XL!"
3.0,returned shoes  a larger size would have given 5 stars<br />return was easy
3.0,"This dress is cotton and fit nicely,  just wouldn't call it elegant.  More of a casual dress,  but cute."
3.0,"I bought this item and it was great for my step sister. However she told me that the glass fell out of the top, but she put it back on and stuck again. So I would say 50 50 on your expirence on this watch. :D Take your chance if you want."
3.0,Runs small size up
3.0,"I love the print and the blouse overall. However, it fit just a little too snug, buy a size larger than normally."
3.0,Too tight across the bust.
3.0,I liked it but it was kinda poor quality.
3.0,"Bought this for my mother to wear at Disney for Halloween.  Mom is very petite, 4'11"" and only about 95 pounds but has arthritis in her hands.  This bracelet was very small, had to stretch it out quite a bit to get it over her hand, very tight to get over arthritic fingers/knuckles."
3.0,"I was hoping for that pretty bright green in the picture and was surprised with the forest green. I also assumed in the picture that there would possible be some kind of support, like a bra, to help keep the girls together and perky and there is not. So unless you have perfect, perky girls you will not look like the girl in the picture LOL. I'm happy with the product for what I paid for it. I'm a size 16 in pants and wear a 38D, I ordered the XXL and wish I had ordered a size up, but I am happy enough with the one I ordered."
3.0,Thought it may me a bit better but not bad for the price.
3.0,"These pants look nice, cute style. But not a good product for a busy, hard core weather lover kid. The pants already have holes in less than six months of infrequent use, maybe every other week."
3.0,I love the concept but the earrings are a bit too small to make out that they are cats unless they're on perfectly straight and I point them out for someone to notice that they are actually cats.  I wish they were a tad bigger.
3.0,"The quality of this bralette seemed good, although it was too small for me. The band was snug enough, but this is definitely only going to work for smaller chested girls. Bummed because it was super cute. I ordered a small, usual size is a 30-32 DDD-F."
3.0,Not comfortable and it's hot to wear as the fabric is stiff and uncomfortable
3.0,Poor quality; fits as expected; has holes after second wash
3.0,"These socks worked out pretty well. When they arrived they looked really small, like a child's sock, but they had a decent stretch. My only complaint is about the larger &#34;netted&#34; sock ripped as soon as I got it on; like I said they were delivered really, really small"
3.0,It took 8 weeks to arrive! And now the shoes barely fit.
3.0,"Overall, not what I expected. Two of the bracelets are cheap looking and very light. While the other two are okay. I was going to buy this as a Christmas gift but decided not to give it to the person. The bracelt with the cross is not bad at all."
3.0,One received broken...other than that love them
3.0,Good steel craftsmanship.  The only problem is that the pin ends are loose which makes for a not so straight and aligned look.
3.0,"I use this eyeglass holder fairly often; however, this one loosens easily so that I have to constantly check and tighten the coil to the loop.  Otherwise, my glasses tend to back out of the loop and fall from my neck if I am not careful, meaning that I can very easily lose my glasses."
3.0,"The top fit perfectly, the skirt had a tiny, tiny waist.  I usually wear a small and should have ordered a medium.  I could almost, but not quite close it.  The material is not the best quality, but for the price, should have been expected.  Donated the skirt, keeping the top for now - the husband likes it."
3.0,The style is nice the material is ok. But when I got it zipper was broken. Reorder another one and it was ok
3.0,"The sleeve length and overall fit was as expected BUT the length is very short, not at all the way it looks in the picture.  This length of this cardigan is more like a shrug and hits above the waist. For reference, I am 5'4&#34;, 120 lbs. and I ordered a small."
3.0,I liked the lightweight fabric but it is much larger than I expected
3.0,Get hair and cotton ball lint stuck easily‚Ä¶. Wish it was made out of different material cuz it‚Äôs cute design
3.0,Super cute.......but VERY small.  Way too expensive to only wear a couple if times!!  Disappointed that the sizing is so off.  Also did not come when guaranteed to come.  (Adding frustration to the existing disappointment!!)
3.0,"El vestido es m√°s corto que la imagen, la tela es suave pero es un poco peque√±o. Pens√© que ser√≠a m√°s ancho porque el la imagen parece m√°s bohemio, pero es m√°s pegado de lo que pens√©. Es bonito."
3.0,I‚Äôm usually a large but ordered a size up as suggested and glad I did! However I feel like they are thin and a little short in the arms. The shirt lays above my wrist bone and I prefer workout shirts a little longer.
3.0,Looks like the picture. However much shorter in the back than I expected.
3.0,"The socks are a little long and wide.  My daughter is 8 months and wearing 6 month clothing,  I purchased 6-12 months and they are way to big on her.  It will be at least another 3-6 months before she can wear them.  Otherwise, the colors are true to the pictures and they are very cute"
3.0,"The fabric of these sweatpants feels like a polyester knit with a wicking quality on the outside, and they are lined with a brushed-fleece polyester on the inside that feels softer and more comfortable than the outer layer.<br /><br />These pants are so long that there seems to be enough leg length to fit someone with as much as a 33-inch inseam. Which is a problem, given they are advertised to have a 30-inch inseam.<br /><br />As long as these sweatpants are, though, through the hip and waist they fit quite a bit smaller than normal for a size large, which is the size we ordered for my husband. In fact, they are so small that they fit me, and I wear women's size medium. So if you wear size large, I would recommend you order extra large of these pants."
3.0,True to size but the quality isn't that great but my daughter likes it and can't complain
3.0,"When wearing the larger sizes, a wide strap would be much better. I am a DD and the straps constantly slide off my shoulders. There was also one strap in the back that had a really sharp edge that poked into my back. I trimmed with scissors.  I purchased the bras also which I'm returning due to the straps being too skinny."
3.0,It‚Äôs alright but the lack of a decent protected pocket for a phone is a significant mistake.
3.0,"True to size & color. Cute. Not of the best quality, but I'm not really surprised by that considering the fairly cheap price. Will probably only last a season; won't be surprised if it starts falling apart by the end of the summer."
3.0,I really wanted to love this dress.  I ordered based on the size chart and it was too tight.
3.0,"cute but smaller than expected, I'm 5'7 and 160 the sleeves were way smaller than in this pic. and I don't have big arms. also the neck piece seemed to lose not tight like In the pic.  my guess is this would look great if I lost 25 pounds and adjusted the neck"
3.0,"These are not 18 gauge, they are 16."
3.0,Was a size smaller than expected but was perfect for my costume. Also the white is slightly see through
3.0,Only issue I have with the romper us it's not very wide across the chest. So if you have a larger chest the top doesn't cover everything.
3.0,It was good  enough and the purpose.
3.0,Looks much better on the wesite
3.0,They don‚Äôt fit snugly but the three lens option is great for the price. Comfortable on the ears.
3.0,"To small, can just get it hooked over ears.  Not ajustible, wish the photo would have shown a better picture.üëé"
3.0,I ordered 80 Finger lights and some were glowing through the packaging when they arrived. 15 of the 80 did not work or had worn out batteries. The quality of construction was not as good as the set of 4 that I had gotten from another source.  I would pay more next time to get a better product.
3.0,"It was a good quality dress, but as there weren't any customer photos of this particular style, I didn't realize that the skirt was shorter (several inches above the knee, and I'm 5'4&#34;) than the other style grouped together with this one.  Also, the top was a bit snug.  For someone with a different build and tastes, this is a great dress.  I can't truthfully say I love it because it's not for me, but I don't want to give it a terrible rating because it's a great dress for the price, for someone who doesn't mind the shorter skirt, etc."
3.0,"This is a lightweight base-layer with a very thin fleece interior.  Sufficient for *cool* weather but definitely not *cold* weather.  What does that mean? I wouldn't expect this to keep me warm under say, 45F, without multiple layers over it if I were walking in the woods, sitting in the stands at a football game, etc. (I'd want something heavier/thicker). It would also be okay for cooler weather when one might exert themselves (shoveling, physical activity) with a temp in the mid-30s.<br /><br />I bought this to wear under my *heated gear* for the motorcycle.  With the heat gear, it'll be fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />(1) Inexpensive ... very inexpensive [as of the moment I purchased this].<br /><br />(2) A two-piece set [see cons].<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1) Runs very, **very** small in the shirt (did I mention that it runs very small?). The pants are ""okay"" - they run slightly small - but are acceptable.  I'm usually an XL in base-layers.  I ordered an 2XL/XXL knowing this is made in China and would likely run small - and it did indeed run smaller (my XXL is definitely not a USA-XXL - it's more like a L/XL).<br /><br />(2) I will have to be VERY careful washing this - separately in cold water and hung to dry - as I cannot afford any shrinkage!<br /><br />In summary, Yes - a base-layer should fit snug but it should be slightly larger than body paint.  If you have a small(er) frame this will be fine for what it is.  I'm around 6' 2"" to 6' 3"" tall and the XXL pants suffice.  The XXL shirt - not so much (girth limit likely 200 lbs, arm length limit probably 33/34"").  For what I paid, all I really wanted were the pants and since they suffice I'll probably keep it."
3.0,"These r very cute,  they come seperatly package so they arent a tangled mess,  I esspecially love the silver feather one and wear it very frequently. The gold ones r very thin and somewhat too small and not really what I was hoping for but one or two of them r nice. Wish they were all made to go even just a spec bigger so I could wear them comfortably without worrying turning my head would choke me or break them. But you get what u pay for I guess"
3.0,Nice looking necklace although it is VERY flimsy.
3.0,"It was very pretty when I first got it, but after 3 days the rose gold on the ""MOM"" started fading"
3.0,These are cute and a great price for the amount of necklaces you are getting. But they are cheaply made and I am worried about them breaking easily when worn because I bought them as a gift. Be careful if you choose to buy them.
3.0,"It fits perfectly and it's pretty, BUT I got rash by wearing it just for few hours!  HELP!"
3.0,"The collar of the shirt feels like it's choking me, every 5mins I have to pull it down. I love the dress just not the collar."
3.0,Nice ankle bracelet.  You CAN NOT live in it 24 hours a day though.
3.0,I have several pairs of fingerless gloves and these are my least favorite pair.  They are not as warm or comfortable as the others I have.  They were also half the price.
3.0,This top is fine for the low price but is not as fitted as it appears in the image.  Even the extra small is a bit baggy on me.
3.0,It broke the first day I used it- beads EVERYWHERE on my first day back to work. It was very pretty while it lasted though.
3.0,"Black was not black, but overall a new favorite fall top‚Ä¶just not a black one."
3.0,Super cute and comfy but really thin material. If you want to layer get bigger size. I'm 5'3 130 pounds and medium is perfect for a slighter oversized look I never zipper jackets so I love it
3.0,"I am only 5""5 and this ""dress"" can only qualify as a miniskirt as it falls to mid-thigh and for me, has to be worn over leggings or tights in order to be decent. I love that it has pockets but they are not cut well enough to lay flat really. The weave of the top is tight and I was actually sweating in it on a cool fall day. The color is a deep forest green and is perfect for the upcoming holiday season."
3.0,Nice but don't go over my knees and I'm only 5 ft 4. Not fat
3.0,"I wasn't expecting much at this price point, but was still a little disappointed. It is made of cheap looking, cheap feeling, flimsy material. It does not look nearly as good as the photos. It is a very tapered design, so I had to remove the darts in the back in order to get it to fit around my mid-section."
3.0,"Great sunglasses but the stinking screws fall out every few weeks that hold the ""bow"" as my wife calls them fall off.  I know it's getting loose when it looks like they fold out further than 90 degrees.  Thankfully I haven't lost any screws yet."
3.0,Fit ok but the skulls were mainly upside down and I didn‚Äôt like the look of that so returned. Nice material and fit perfect though.
3.0,"I'll start by saying it's adorable. But the shirt has ZERO stretch. It JUST fits my 13mo, and I ordered 18mo size. My daughter's slender, too. She won't be able to wear it very long. This is why I hate buying baby clothes. Why are baby clothes sized like babies are supermodels?"
3.0,Me gust√≥ todo est√° linda la pulsera
3.0,Fit is as expected but the length is not as shown in display. It looks like a t-shirt not a tunic.  Love the texture.
3.0,"THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING, BUT I THOUGHT THE HOODIE WOULD BE A HEAVIER WEIGHT........VERY THIN NYLON MATERIAL.......NOT THICK ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU WARM.  A T-SHIRT IS THICKER THAN THIS HOODIE.  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN PURCHASE."
3.0,"It was really pretty, but super thin gold chain for the price, and the bar is small."
3.0,"I always want rompers to work on me, but they never do!  It ran a little small, but the fabric is so cute!"
3.0,An aesthetic watch but date doesn‚Äôt set well in the middle of the display box. I don‚Äôt know if this is a fault from a bad gear in the watch but overall quality looks good.
3.0,Sizing on this is way off. Ordered a medium same as he wears in literally everything else. This shirt is like a crop top on him‚Ä¶ return process seemed more of a headache then it was worth. My 8yr old son may get better use of the shirt. Super disappointed‚Ä¶
3.0,"The product is good but, There isn‚Äôt a very good durability"
3.0,Comes directly from China shipping will be several weeks. No instructions. Perfect fit for Barbie sized dolls. Definelty not for small children due to small parts.
3.0,We will see what the bride and groom say. ;)
3.0,"This is the second set of these . They work very well; but the lenses are not very secure. On the second set, I glued  the lenses in before using them."
3.0,"OK, here we go. I love the bag, good size, like the look. It does have the &#34;smell&#34; issue .... still, but much less. The quality of the leather is random, some pieces of leather are thicker than others. One side of the bag, the inner liner was not sewn/attached.<br />Just traveled for the first time with it. It got damaged. one of the handle anchors tore out (it was of thin leather, the other side was not).<br />Also I would like to note that the shoulder strap is not removible, personally, I don't like that.<br />I know what I paid for it, and I'll concider it a fair price (you get what you pay for). I will have it repair and continue to use it.<br />NOTE: I had purchased this and had it in my closet for almost a year before my first use."
3.0,They send me the wrong pattern it‚Äôs close enough but it‚Äôs not the right one. Plus if it‚Äôs<br />smaller than the other I bought of the same size.
3.0,The price was good. I will say the straps seem very soft. My 4 year old isn‚Äôt bothered by these. I did have to put small knots in the straps to make them smaller for my 4 year old (he does have sort of a small head).  I like the nose is flexible. The design print is totally upside down which is disappointing.
3.0,It‚Äôs ok a little disappointed that band was very thin for the price but I only wear white in summer on my Capri Swarovski watch
3.0,Fit nicely... maybe just a little small on the top. The flowers fell off super fast though
3.0,"runs small, has a weird cut. material not as expected"
3.0,Looks bigger in photo wish there was a photo of it on something for comparison.  Also I bought this for the dark color and the one I received was light colored.
3.0,"Bought this for our Nana for her birthday and she absolutely loved it! It was so cute on her. However, after only a couple days of wearing it, it fell right off her neck. Its appears as if the clasp had somehow broken. I was so heartbroken. I just used the pendant and bought another necklace."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:fe1340656cd279280d3c5cbe9d3d4ac0]] The product itself is perfect. I was just excited to receive the product as it was a gift and once received I realized that I was sent both moons.
3.0,Not as soft as I would have liked.
3.0,"Its a very nice Tie clip, i love the design, the color is cute, it stays put when I clip it to my tie. the downside is I just got it, have worn it twice and already the paint is thinning, its hard to see in the photo but some of the silver is shining through on the middle of the door. I can paint over It but I wish i didn't have to."
3.0,"I wish I'd ordered a larger size. So sad to have to send it back, but I'll try a bigger size next time :)"
3.0,Looks as expected. Smelled kinda weird. Tight fit for rings with thicker bands.
3.0,"I really liked the design of this top, however it fits small.  I'm 5'7"" and 120lb.  Ordered a small, but it was really tight and just too clingy. The length was good, though.  I'm afraid the armholes would be too big if I got a Medium, also probably too long.  Returning for full refund."
3.0,"very thin, but still cute!"
3.0,Pendant is attached to the chain in a way that it cannot be removed an put on a different chain. Otherwise quite pretty.
3.0,"Super cute but the bottom pieces keep falling off; I had to glue them back on, but well worth the money."
3.0,Love the way it looks and feels on. But worn 3 times and I feel like it looks worn out already.
3.0,"fabric is thin, lace edges will curl after some time"
3.0,"I gave three stars as I have a white striped version of this dress that fits like a dream. Then, I ordered the plain black version (same size as the white striped dress) and it came in different material and was noticeably smaller. Inconsistent sizing and inconsistent materials."
3.0,"I love the size and shape, however; the posts are getting brown for an item that is 14k gold"
3.0,Loved the slippers but they were too wide in the heel and kept flopping on and off as I walked.
3.0,"The glass was not fitting properly, it was a little loose."
3.0,"So I really want to love this skirt but it falls short in two areas: fit and style.<br /><br />It looks a little too practical. I think the designer is going for a trendy look but unfortunately it looks dated. And that fact ties in to the next problem: the gathers over your behind.<br /><br />The front actually looks ok. However, the front is overshadowed by the billows of fabric hanging off your derri√®re. That did it for me. I officially cannot wear this skirt confidently until I take a pair of scissors to it and make some amateur alterations.  I sized up because of other reviews (I bought a large, I‚Äôm usually a size 10 for the bottom half and 6/8 for the top half). I really didn‚Äôt need to size up because it‚Äôs an A-line fit. So maybe it would have looked better in a smaller size. I‚Äôll make it smaller and maybe update my review.<br /><br />The positive is that the price is right. So worth the risk of making a purchase I guess."
3.0,Sun glasses work ok but the glasses film or plastic Len keep come off easy or pop off suddenly  good thing u just pop it back and use it again cheap sun glasses and u don‚Äôt mind  to loose it easy someday
3.0,GOT HAT DID NOT WORK EMAIL THE BUYER NO RESPONSE I THINK IMMA HAVE TO GO TO A BATTERY STORE THAN THE HAT WANT BE WORTH THE PRICE PAID BUYER HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY 2 EMAILS ABOUT WAT TO DO EVEN THE BLK BUTTON INSIDE DO NOT WORK SO ITEM HAS NOT TURNED ON
3.0,"May be wise to get half-size larger for some room.  Haven't used in snow yet, just hoping for dryness."
3.0,el size es muy pque&ntilde;o a pesar de ser xl
3.0,Hard for me to open.  Doesn't hold very many cards.  Like the cover design.
3.0,I liked the watch design and style of the banding. However the two loops to hold the extra banding for the watch band broke after only 6 months of occasional wearing of the watch.
3.0,"Disappointed! It came with one of the srings, that hold the shape, broken. I‚Äôm going to get a replacement"
3.0,Very small and dye of leather comes off on hands
3.0,Very small. This does not fit an average wrist.  I gave it away to a teenager.
3.0,"Not very comfortable, kind of bulky Stays in place which is nice."
3.0,I ordered XXXL which are the equivalent to XXL. Tight in the boobs and tight all over too. I should have read more reviews before buying. They will work well for a big call with smaller breast but not for those of us who wear a 40 and up.
3.0,It is definitely for under dresses.. Very see through..
3.0,"I am a 38C and mine have never been perky.  This did not really work at all. yes, it stayed on, but my breasts looked terrible in the top I bought this for. Droopy.  I bought a bandeau underwire style from Target's new Auden line and it's 10 times better."
3.0,PRETTY JUST TOO SMALL. SIZING IS OFF.
3.0,"Works great. Cool sleek ergonomic design. Very wellbilt but it is very tight to fit my drivers license and four debit/credit cards. Really overpriced, product should cost 30-40 dollars max instead of 70."
3.0,"The detail is not as cool as the picture, it's actually quite plain. It will work, it at least gives me a base and I will just paint it more myself and add some fake blood to the top so it looks cool. For the price it's ok."
3.0,I finally received these today.
3.0,"Material is ok but sizing is too large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 110 lbs and the small draped on me and was way too long (past my knees).<br />Pretty color but need to return it as it‚Äôs not flattering at all on the bottom part, it‚Äôs just too bulky.  Wish they had XS."
3.0,Very pretty but gets tangled to easily when wearing it. Doesn't stick with the layered look I was going for.
3.0,"Not sure about the sole material as it gave me a large blister/callus in the same spot on both feet. Not fun, especially on vacation."
3.0,Okay. Description says there are &#34;matte&#34; but the frames are shiny. They are larger that traditional Ray Bans as well so keep that in mind. For $10 not bad... only slightly better than some $1 glasses.
3.0,nice for collecting not for wearing
3.0,Felt like paper but it served the purpose
3.0,I really did love this bracelet. I may re order a different metal type as the silver plate tarnished pretty quickly
3.0,Very cute outfit but runs small like 3 sizes too small bought it for my cousins daughter that wears size 7 and ended up giving it to my niece that wears size 4
3.0,"Print was a little off, it had ink on the collar portion of the vneck"
3.0,"I love this sweater but I wouldn't recommend putting it in the dryer, as mine seemed to tighten up/shrink significantly, making it much more snug than when it first arrived."
3.0,Love them ! Cute and fit my face perfectly. Plus the case is super cute the only downside was the sunglasses did not fit in the sunglass case. . . ha
3.0,"I LOVE this robe. The colors are beautiful, the fit is perfect, it is lightweight and cool. It is everything I wanted for.....except the absolutely HORRENDOUS STENCH! It was packaged quite well when it arrived. As a matter of fact, it was double packaged and I'm guessing that was to disguise the overwhelming chemical smell. I washed it as I normally do new clothing, and the smell did not go away. So I second washed it in regular detergeant, only this time with the help of some washing soda. Still no luck on the smell. After the THIRD washing in white vinegar, the smell dissipated slightly, only to return when I placed the item in a heated dryer. Instead of wearing it this evening, it is now hanging on my back porch in the hopes it will eventually 'air out&#34; and keep the odor from permeating my house any further. I have no clue what chemical they used to preserve this fabric, but believe me, it is strong and pungent. I definitely do not want it near my skin or in my house. Hopefully, after tomorrow's fourth washing, I will be able to wear it. It's a shame because it is an otherwise awesome robe. If you have any allergies or sensitivities to smell, I would keep searching."
3.0,The zipper broke about a week of wearing it. By it worked!
3.0,The product could be roomier that would make it comfortable.
3.0,Very pretty but won't lay flat when two ends of scarf are inserted.
3.0,"They actually fit my glasses very well. The (huge) downside is they cause an amount of glare so much so that I can't really see with them on. Sad really, I was hoping this would be my end came of being blinded by the sun while wearing my driving glasses. They also look quite bulky which I could live with seeing how they are clip ons."
3.0,"Good size for big sunglasses, not so hard."
3.0,I was devastated
3.0,"About what one expects for the price. Cute , but not especially well made. It is a great width and really emphasizes your waist. Worth the price ."
3.0,Nice but needs a zipper or closure
3.0,"I am giving this ""SINGULAR"" band a 3.  The rest (that I bought) are a 5.  I didn't really look at the photo closely until after I purchased it.  Look closely at the photo in the ad and you'll understand my comments below<br /><br />The color of this band, blue with piping is actually on the inside of the band, against the wrist.  So, the band is black with blue piping on the outside except for where you pull the band over to engage the velcro and secure the watch to your wrist. There and only there is visible blue with blue piping, so this band is black AND blue, but it doesn't look good, doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me..."
3.0,"I got this dress for work. The magenta color is beautiful. I'm not a pink wearing person, but magenta looks good on me. I am 5'7.5 115lbs, and the small is kind of big (wide) and short on me. I figured there would be quite a bit of wiggle room on top, but the waist is also baggy. It's not super short, but I wouldn't mind it being 2-3 inches longer. That's how I feel about most garments though.. tall-ish people problems. Cute enough to wear to work."
3.0,Good quality.  Runs large
3.0,The sticky bumps do not extend over the toes or back heel and so they make certain positions very hard of doing barre or yoga.
3.0,"I gave this to a person and then a few days later, they told me one of the charms broke off when they dropped it. Very disappointed üòû"
3.0,Nice good size however after one wash it got balls on it
3.0,They were just laughably giant! I don't know if my face is just small or what! They seem well made and sturdy just wayyyy to big for my face!
3.0,"Really cute and the overall quality isn‚Äôt bad, but sit very crooked on."
3.0,"Product description and picture seemed to suggest that there was a belt that comes with the garment, when there is not. I am 6'1&#34; and long waisted. Therefore, this item doesn't hang right on me and is too short."
3.0,This ran small across the shoulders but otherwise it was ok
3.0,Dress is ok to wear at home...too see through.
3.0,Not as sparkly or pretty in person but it's okay. I just needed to put something else in my piercing.
3.0,"These shoes are fun and my for year old was thrilled to see how they light up. However, I am at a loss as to how they buckle. If anyone has advice on this, we'd appreciate it. Since she got them, she had only work them once because we can't figure out how to safely secure them!"
3.0,"The vest is absolutely adorable, but the medium is quite snug.I wear a medium in nearly everything; I expected it to fit better."
3.0,"As another review stated, the hinge on our pair of Oakley Shifter XS 50's also broke.  Ours lasted a year before they broke. Looking to replace the frame here on Amazon."
3.0,"really lovely socks, will purchase more. Update: no more purchasing of these. It is pity that so lovely socks made of unknown fabric, definitely no cotton at all! Thats why seller never responds what are they made of..."
3.0,Top ripped easily. Poor quality
3.0,It was too big to actually fit around my neck as a chocker so I had to take off the charm and put it on a new chain.
3.0,"They are nice and arrived just like they said! They are a little flat, no curve to fit"
3.0,Beautiful dress. Definitely not a dress for a heavier chested person. Dress was a bit small and unflattering
3.0,"This watch is very cute and i love that the band is magnetic, however i ordered the purple watch and i got the brown one. The watch is a copper brown with a blue black face. The gem at the very top is crooked too and there is a slight scratch under the ‚ÄúR‚Äù on my watch. It does come with a gift box which is nice."
3.0,The antique silver ring looks OK but there are a couple downsides in my opinion. The top of the ring really needs the edges rolled down. As it is now the outside edges of the ring cut into the sides of the fingers on each side of the ring. It's not too bad just sitting around but when I'm working with my hands or playing guitar it starts to hurt a bit.<br />The antiquing looks OK on it's own but it makes the runes not as noticeable. The runes are a lot thinner lines than I was expecting. They are so thin that they really don't stand out a ton against the antiquing.<br />Overall the ring isn't bad and it looks OK but I wouldn't be able to wear it 24/7. If the edges were rolled I'd like it a lot better.
3.0,Por el precio no puedes tener nada mejor.
3.0,"Excited about receiving these shoes but sadly the left shoe rubbed on the top and side of my little toe.  The right shoe fit perfectly, the height and arch were great.  I am disappointed that I was not able to wear them."
3.0,Definitely was not the oversized fit like in the model photo and I went up in one size from the short sleeve version (which fit just like the model photo) - so there are some inconsistencies between the 3/4 fit vs the short sleeve fit. Still made a nice shirt to wear with leggings. Material is soft and stretchy. But had some weight to it.
3.0,"Sizing exactly as expected.  This was wrinkled and after washed even more so.  Really soft and comfortable, but would not want to wear in front of other people."
3.0,"The fit on these is nice and they are long. The stitching began coming out of the finger tips pretty quickly. They were kind of cheaply made, but they did not cost much to begin with."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:2037b9fe5899c8ea1b242e4a2bde31c7]] Que muy lindo lo √∫nico malo es que la tela se trasparenta mucho
3.0,I needed to get it fitted.
3.0,"This dress is a bit thin, but cute. Neckline is higher than expected & not flattering without a belt. A belt May fix the issue, but the v neck is higher on the shirt I recieved than the one in the photo."
3.0,The real thing would look great on an heiress - but this one was obviously a fake a looked gaudy. Returned it.
3.0,I love the look but the arms are way too short. I cut the cuffs out of the sleeve and resewed them down farther to cover my wrists. I would size up if ordering again. Quality and look is brilliant!
3.0,It was too small and the wrong color. I order a 2xx large because the review said it runs small but it was still too small. Very cute dress but runs very small.
3.0,Item was returned because I found it somewhat scratchy to exposed skin. I am sensitive to some materials. I did like that it was light weight.
3.0,"Read through before buying-  I INITIALLY REALLY liked it.  But, After 2 wearings of about a half hour, and without even washing or drying, IT'S ALREADY LOST MOST of it's ELASTICITY AND CONTINUALLY NEEDS TO BE TOUCHED, ADJUSTED, AND PULLED UP!  That's  COMPLETELY DEFEATING ITS SAFETY AND PURPOSE!  However, If you don't need Corona virus protection,  like if you're vaccinated or recently recovered, but need to wear one to meet the mandate, this is comfortable and breathable, just no real protection because of the constant handling to adjust for constantly slipping. Red vines for scale!"
3.0,I wish the sleeves were little longer and the length is too short.
3.0,"I guess these are not made for short people.  I kept them anyway, but even on the tightest setting the garter straps are too long."
3.0,Adorable print! A little on the thin side and extremely short in the torso length! Way too short in the crotch.
3.0,The zipper was very shaky i felt like it wouldn't withstand the night so i didnt wanna take any chances.  I returned it.
3.0,"Beautiful! Shiny, sparkly and do not irritate my sensitive ears....I even received them a day ahead of schedule! Only negative and reason for 3 stars, the earring backs are way too soft. They need to fit much much tighter. I replaced all backs with ones that stayed on better. Thanks!"
3.0,"Fit alot smaller than the chart described, very form fitting and slit in front is all the way up to the crotch area"
3.0,Looked better in picture
3.0,"Ordered 2 one white and one orange. This one was cut totally different and smaller than the the white one, and not as roomy. I will return this item."
3.0,Too big and pops off easily
3.0,"I was mainly interested in this set because it contains a 16g and 1g taper. Everything is about how you would expect, and was packaged/labeled nicely.<br /><br />However - although the first stretch was effortless and painless, the tunnels unfortunately did a number on my ears within a few hours. To be honest I kind of expected that would happen, given the price of the set, but I figured that since it was so cheap it was worth a try anyways. I'd stay away from this one if you have sensitive ears."
3.0,"They look good but run a little small. After a couple months my heels started getting tender so I took the insoles out and they are paper thin. Underneath there was 5 nail heads that were pushing against my heel through the soles. I bought new insoles to remedy this, but since they run small to begin with now the boots are very tight.  Overall good boots for the price, just get a half size larger."
3.0,"Ok, these are nice camisoles. They are labeled 95% cotton. I don‚Äôt think so; they feel more like 50% cotton. That‚Äôs fine, if you don‚Äôt really care. I do; these will be too hot!"
3.0,The bangle bracelet came with 2 broken bracelet . The one that's has the marble design already came off and the other has a broken end. I also get a 2 identical design .. .over all it's ok
3.0,"I ordered a large and it fits like a medium. The vest is too tight. I recommend ordering a size up when purchasing this product.<br />I‚Äôve ordered stuff from Amazon before and the large has always fit, I guess there is alway a first time."
3.0,... but didn't fit
3.0,"These are a decent product for the price and will work for a Halloween costume. Only complaints I have is the print is more navy blue than true dark black. Ordered the matching top from another seller and that is true black and this looks blue. Also the legs seem a little different sized, left leg is nice and stretchy but right leg feels tight almost like the seam is twisted a bit. Can feel that where they join together as well, right side meets up maybe and inch off in the center so I feel like I need to keep hiking up the right side of the leggings. But for the price, good for a few wears as a costume."
3.0,"Loved the look of this hat. Retro as hell. Couldn't wait to get it. Got it and it was tiny. The hat seems like a good quality but it  almost was a junior size. Extended the adjustable thing out to the last two holes, and was still tight and looked goofy on my head. While my head is a little larger than average, it's not THAT big. I wish there was more info on hats in the descriptions. Most people probably would not wear 3 out of 4 hats because they're too big, too small, not tall enough, too tall etc. More info would have saved all parties time and $$$. Oh well."
3.0,I usually wear a size 8. i ordered size 8. This shoe runs small. I suggest if u order go up .5 in size. Overall NOT impressed with the shoe.
3.0,Fits slightly odd. Feels good around but is a bit short in the torso
3.0,"I had purchased this for my son, he is 14. I did not notice the beer can in the pocket of the guys shirt. I thought it was funny and he would get a charge out of it and he did. purchased a fabric pen so I would color this out. Not thinking that it is appropriate for a 14 year old to wear. Like it otherwise."
3.0,Frame is good but the color is fainting in one side..its not pure golden color.<br />I couldn‚Äôt return it as it was shipped OUS so i had to use it the way it is..
3.0,"I am returning this dress because it is too short for me. I am 5'6&#34; and a size 10. When I tried to style this dress the same way I style the long version of the dress, it comes up several inches above my knee. It's disappointing but I will stick with the long dresses and just cut them to the length I prefer. The benefit of this is that I can then use the cut off material to sew a bandeau for more coverage."
3.0,A bit on the small side if you're a large. This is not a full circle shirt. The fabric is beautiful and the lining is nice but be aware of the smaller sizing on this. I really thought it would have been a bit fuller looking by the photos.
3.0,"These pants look really comfy - soft & lightweight, the print is pretty with vibrant colors. Unfortunately, they run VERY small. I'm a normal size 10 - 5'4"" & 145 lb - I can't even get them on. If I could get them on, it looks like the length would hit midway between knee & ankle. Gave to my granddaughter - she's 11yr old - 4'5"" & 75 lbs - and they fit her. She likes the little pocket on the side to put her cell phone in, wish it was a bit larger as cell phones keep getting bigger. She can get her iPhone XR in the pocket, but it easily falls out."
3.0,Cute but a runs a bit too large.
3.0,Great quality but I needed to go up a size and couldn‚Äôt. Searched and searched for that option
3.0,My pin arrived and I got to wear it one day. I lost the pin some place the first day. I found the back clasp but not the pin. Very disappointing.
3.0,Shirt seems like good quality but the sizing is way off.  I'm a XL and ordered the 4xl (xl) and it's definitely too small.  Will be sending them back. I don't know if I'll order again.  I need a roomier shirt to work in.
3.0,"I ordered a medium size in the same brand of  another style. Top runs extremely small compared to the other style, so if you typically wear one size buy the next up to be safe. Style was adorable and price is certainly great.. Would have ordered another one, but I leave for my trip tomorrow and didn't have time."
3.0,This product is a good quality. I was however mislead as i thought I was purchasing a two pack of bracelets (one blue and one pink). It does only come with one.
3.0,Comfortable soft but a little too big
3.0,"My watch appears to be missing a piece, so the strap constantly falls off. I say ""appears"" because it didn't actually come with any sort of detailing instructions, diagram, parts list, etc. just a generic note on setting the time and ""date."" I can't even find out what the missing piece looks like, just that there are some empty holes where a pin or something else goes.<br /><br />The watch was smaller than I was expecting, and not as luxurious as I was hoping. The disc with the painting on it sits noticeably higher than the back of the watch, which I probably should have expected, but wasn't clear from the photos. I still would like to keep the watch and would exchange it for a complete on or get the missing piece, but it seems the only option Amazon gives me is to return it."
3.0,"it is larger than i was expecting, do not fit on my ear, im looking they way to cut it."
3.0,"Long in the torso, small in the bust. I ultimately had to return it for those reasons. Cute suit though. I wish it had fit."
3.0,"I was shopping for a Smart Watch, but I cannot have any device that transmits or receives where I work. Also, I wanted a watch that is solar-powered so I will never have to worry about changing batteries. That limits options for solar-powered which has many features ‚Äúlike‚Äù a Smart Watch.<br />This watch was one of the top choices.<br />It is a nice watch, but not worth the $200 Retail Price listed by Casio, nor the current price at Amazon ($125) ... $70-$80 would be a more reasonable price.<br />The sensors are inconsistent and unreliable.<br />For instance, I can get drastic differences in Altitude for the same exact location each day, and the thermometer measures case temperature, which is basically skin temperature while wearing it on your wrist ... you have to take the watch off for at least 20 minutes to get any kind of accurate temperature reading.<br />Also, even though I have left the watch in direct Sun for many hours (over several days), the battery charge level never gets above M (Medium).<br />I had another solar-powered Casio G-Shock watch that I had for over 15 years, and had traveled around the World. It worked flawlessly until it recently kept freezing when trying to synchronize (WaveCeptor) with the Atomic Clock in Fort Collins (Colorado), which only works in most of the Continental United States."
3.0,Very little compression. Felt like a regular workout shirt.
3.0,The jewelry is beautiful but the quality is just so so.
3.0,"So, where do I begin; I don't often write reviews right away when I don't feel their is a need for it specially when getting the item a day after, but I needed to write this review as I have mixed feelings with this watch. So the BullToro Watch 0001 is definitely a looker, it actually looks great, now let me tell you something, that's where the WOW factor and COOL looking watch ends. I know this watch only cost 80 dollars 86 with tax etc.....however I was expecting a high quality watch that would feel natural and sturdy on the hand, something with a little weight on it that I know will last me a long time. I was wrong, Although the watch is pretty big roughly 60mm big the actual watch itself not counting the entire bezel itself is roughly around maybe 30mm big as you can see in the pictures below it. So why the 3 stars if it looks great, well as I mention earlier that's where the WOW and COOL factor ends. The watch is pretty much made out of poly-carbonate core if that's what they want to call it, I call it plastic, plastic is still plastic no matter how high quality it is. Yes I said it, its plastic, everything except the top and bottom which is covered is made of plastic up until the band is connected to it, it only is being covered by 2 thin maybe 2mm layers of stainless steel top and bottom. Now lets talk about the band itself, the band is made of the same material that the watch is made off, the black tips holding the watch are made of plastic up until you reach the bottom portions of the watch to wrap on your hand are made of high grade rubber. The stainless steel bands are not high quality, or at-least they do not look high quality as its pretty much hollow on the inside of the steel bands. The presentation of the box and the accessories that came with it, is of no importance to me, there presentation is decent, that doesn't make me drop points, however the watch does. Now on the amazon page it says that the glass on the watch is made of high grade mineral glass. I don't believe that is made of mineral glass because mineral does not scratch that easily when cleaning the glass or the stainless steel with a high grade micro-fiber cloth, you can't see the small scratches it left on the pictures but they are there, If I'm not mistaken this looks like acrylic crystal and not mineral crystal, which is made of manufactured plastic so someone is lying on this page. Maybe its me that I've gotten so use-to owning high end quality made stainless steel watches that they feel big, heavy, and sturdy they don't feel like they will break just by moving my hand really fast, maybe if they would of also done the same with this watch I wouldn't have this mix feelings, I'm torn from wanting to return this watch and getting my money back or keeping it just for the look.<br /><br />Here is my unbiased final thoughts, What do I think of this watch, its great looking but not a keeper unless you are into the WOW and COOL Factor. If they would of made the entire watch stainless steel I would of been very impressed, maybe up the price to 150 or 200 dollars, I would of still bought the watch because I like quality watches that feel sturdy and high grade. They did right on the design, the design is great if not amazing, but the quality control of the watch is horrible. If the sellers are reading this I hope they learn from this because people want quality watches not watches that looks like a high priced toy looking watch, and fire the guy that had the bright idea of making a plastic watch. Yes this watch looks like a really expensive toy to me. Do I think this watch is worth 80 dollars, NO I definitely do not think this watch is worth 80, if not that, I think it's worth at-least 50 dollars if not less. I will give my second final thoughts in a week or 2 as I mention earlier that I have mixed Feelings on whether I want to keep the watch or return it back and get my money back and spend the extra 100 dollars on a high grade watch that is all stainless steel.<br /><br />UPDATE AS OF 08/22/2016<br />Alright so it has been little over a week since I reviewed this watch, and I have finally concluded my final thoughts about the Bulltoro watch. Although I still feel strongly about my feelings on the quality control of this watch, the COOL factor and WOW looking watch factor won me over from the quality control. Yes this watch is pretty cool looking and honestly although it is made of polycarbonate plastic and feels like a really expensive toy, I've grown to like it and if you want to try this watch out for the cool factor I'd recommend buying it, the pictures are proof of how the watch looks on your hand, I'm average size that has a 7.7 wrist and it fits perfectly. I still think the watch is still high price for the quality control thus I will keep it at 3 stars because of the quality control and the glass either being really cheap mineral glass or being acrylic glass after cleaning the glass and noticing a few scratches when cleaning it with a high quality micro fiber cloth. Also if you like the attention that alot of people specially girls will give you then this is for you."
3.0,I received my order today. So excited but only received 2 pairs versus 3. Thy look like good quality so far. Can't wait to wear them.
3.0,These are cheap bifocal sunglasses fit is very poor
3.0,Cute shirt but a little shorter than expected.
3.0,Alittle small
3.0,"I followed the size chart, and these pants are much too small. They are soft and more like leggings.  I ordered a medium."
3.0,A little bigger than I thought. One mushroom was broken
3.0,"Edited Review:  I changed my star level on these because after having them just less than a year they are already beginning to get a hole near the seam.  Before this I loved these but I am a little disappointed that they are already starting to get holes in them.  I am not sure if I just got a poorly sewn pair or if they would all do this.<br /><br />Original Review: They fit true to size.  I usually am a women's 8 or 9 and fit perfectly into the medium.  Also, for me they are a really nice length.  I am about 5'5&#34; and might have short legs because often capri pants look more like high waters on me, they often come too far down my legs.  This pair stops just a few inches below my knees. They are made of very comfortable material.  They are a comfortable fit, tight as yoga pants should be but not too tight to make them uncomfortable.  I have worn them both to do yoga and to just relax around the house and they are perfect for both!  They didn't slip down while doing yoga which is important for me as this has been a problem with other pants worn for yoga.  The only thing I don't love about them is that sometimes the line from my underwear shows a little bit (however I think this is usually the case with cozy tighter fitting clothes) and it wasn't a huge deal for me.  After washing them a few times I have noticed that the area where my thighs rub together the material is starting to pill (when it forms small balls on the material) a little bit.  Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for a writing review, however, this is my honest review."
3.0,The quality is poor and the earrings are much larger than I expected.
3.0,Small necklace.  Pretty.  Comes in a case.
3.0,Very difficult to get in.
3.0,The watermelons are far more pink than red still cute though.
3.0,This is not for a daith. Its to big and hard to fit in your ear. The product overall is great and sturdy. I'm rating 3 stars due to it saying it's for a daith and its not. The seller was great with issuing a refund and I was able to order a smaller one. Both items I ordered came with a free small gift.
3.0,"This outfit was really cute the only problem was, it wasn‚Äôt the size I ordered.."
3.0,Ripped easily but nice design
3.0,"After reading reviews, I decided to purchase one size larger than normal. Great decision as this dress does run small. I absolutely love the print and style. My only concern is that the fabric is pretty sheer.. even with the dark navy, I'm nervous of some peak-a-boos. I also need to find the right no-show bra cups if I plan on wearing this...because the cut on the chest sides into the open back are tricky. I almost purchased this same dress on another site for twice the price... so glad I found it on amazon prime!"
3.0,it was too small. but made pretty good
3.0,"Cute shirt, on the thinner side and definitely size up, I normally wear a medium and the large fit perfect, it definitely would have been to small/short if I got a medium."
3.0,"I'm a wedding photographer who is super active on the shoots - squatting, lunging, leaning, bending. My shirt tails always used to come out and I'd look disheveled by a half hour into the session. I'm 6'5&#34; and these are barely long enough when let all the way out and they keep my shirt tails in all day long!<br /><br />Update at year's end.<br /><br />These are not that durable. Lasted less than 25 uses before one of the clips broke. Leading up to the break there were many slippages where a clip would pop off of the shirt and then just be dangling behind my knee stabbing me. While they worked they were good. I've since moved to the Thigh attaching style which are more comfortable and if one clip comes undone is doesn't hang down to your knee and become a bother. You also won't have the elastic bands rubbing the sides of your legs all day while you walk. Go with the Thigh style."
3.0,"It fits a little bit tighter for a bigger chested person. Otherwise, it is very pretty and a great dress for the summer."
3.0,"Received these quickly.  They are good quality, and are really quite pretty.  Purchased to wear under a strappy summer dress. All of the similar bras I have found locally are unlined soft-cup, and at 34A, I need a little bit of padding.  I ordered large, according to the size chart.  Many previous reviews state they run small. I was apprehensive about ordering Large, but did so based on sizing chart and previous reviews.  Unfortunately, I should have trusted my gut instincts and ordered the Medium, because the large is just too large for me.  Really want to love this, but it is just too big!"
3.0,Super cute . It doesn‚Äôt have a tag so can‚Äôt tell front or back and it‚Äôs a tad itchy but not bad enough you can‚Äôt wear it. Fits great and super cute though
3.0,Might as well be plastic but cool design
3.0,I didn‚Äôt like the Lenght....It was too long.
3.0,Too big and color is odd.
3.0,"...again... it seems like really low quality metal. I typically really like SPUNKYsoul's stuff... but this last order, I'm not too impressed with the quality."
3.0,The pendant is well made but too big if you‚Äôre trying to use it as a cosplay piece. The cord is not long enough to double wrap either.
3.0,"The skirt was a bit small, but it was wearable and it looked cute. My only issue is that the zipper got stuck - like I couldn't get it off. We ended up having to rip it off entirely."
3.0,"Original dress arrived filthy, second dress was the incorrect color. Beautiful dress nonetheless."
3.0,It's pretty but a lot smaller than it looks in the picture
3.0,"These came in different sizes, one was stretchy enough to hold my hair (without bobby pins) my hair is thick/heavy and is a little past shoulder length. But many of the snoods are so small they barely fit around my head. If I really pull/stretch them before wearing they loosen up enough that I can get them on and wear them, though they give me a headache because they are so tight. But the ones that do fit are fantastic, I wear the black one all the time, and love it! The smaller ones would probably work better for a civil war/late 1800s kind of style, with a hat worn on the top of the head. I was looking for a looser one to fit over my whole head for a Reconnaissance type style. I gave three stars because I did get a couple that fit and that I wear regularly."
3.0,Loved the coat and style. Lining was nice! Sizing was off. Somewhat smaller than expected. Asian sizing which nothing indicated this.
3.0,Super cute but not made for us thick thigh women
3.0,It would be better if they didn't send me a vest with a ripped tag and the metal from the buttons residue smeared on the jacket. So I washed it and part of the under arm ripped some. I'm glad I only bought this for a one time use...
3.0,Unfortunately bought two of these.  The adjustable ends make this band impossible to install. No way can compress the adjustable ends and the spring bar to slide between the lugs.
3.0,"While this is an attractive design, it runs extremely small and I ordered an X Large!"
3.0,"Very hard to get my cards out once they are in this. I only carry 4, my cash is ok."
3.0,they are nice enough they just are not my style........thought they looked differnt then what they did when i recieved them....
3.0,packaging makes the product look cheap. This is a x-mas present had to find a better jewelry box to make it look good.  May choose to return it.
3.0,The glasses were an improvement but not 100% -- there are still stars around oncoming headlights which was a disappointment.
3.0,"I have an older pair of Draftsman flip flops in size 10 from a few years ago. I liked them, but they have loosened up quite a bit, so i figured I'd get a new pair. But these new ones don't seem to be the same. I found the 10s to be too big and loose, while the 9s too tight and small, and there are no 1/2 sizes. I was pretty disappointed since I originally liked the older pair"
3.0,"I did not like the fabric of this jacket. I thought it was going to be cotton, but it felt more like satin and snags. Skeletons are pretty small."
3.0,"These were okay for the price. The fabric was pretty thin, but I didn't pay a lot for them and they worked for the event that I needed them for."
3.0,"The material is very thin, much thinner than I expected for yoga sport pants."
3.0,"I ordered these boots and they fit fine, just make sure you order your size. I bought a 9, and wear an 8 1/2 so they're a bit big. Also, be careful ordering products from China, the heels are crooked on the boots, and they are slippery at first; do rough them a bit"
3.0,The quality on this is good and the sleeves are fun and unique but the body length on the sweater is short for me. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù so I think this would be better suited for a petite person.
3.0,"They are ok, as long as you are getting them for a small child or a kid with a small head. This did not work well for my 11 year old who has a big head."
3.0,"For the price, this bag definitely looks more expensive than it is.  I like the simple, classic look of it, but I did not like how it felt when I put it on.  The material is very stiff, almost felt like putting on a cardboard box.  Also, the straps are thinner than I would like, making it uncomfortable on my shoulders.  I also don't like how long the handle on top of the bag is.  I'm assuming it was made that long in order to double as a handbag, but that was also an awkward look with the 2 straps hanging off the sides.  Not bad for the price, and definitely looks like the picture, but I will be returning because I did not like the feel of the bag."
3.0,I order 2xl it fit snug in my thighs but around the waist it feel like it be sliding down when I walk. but overall I love the pants and how they feel but its something about the waist part that bother me
3.0,The actual size is way too small than the size chart discribes. So I would give the product a 1 star for &#34;product is not as described&#34;. But the return process is easy. So the service gets a 5 star.
3.0,This is a large and I wear 38c or 36d and not even a full cup. This suit fit like a medium. I would have had to have gotten an xl or xxl to cover the boob shown here. High leg which I wanted. The colors SPOT ON (get it hehe) The top strap cut into neck. Poor execution for a trendy style.
3.0,Pretty but flimsy feel. They fit well which I'm happy about. They do keep catching on my woolens though so that is annoying. Would have loved them to feel heavier and more substantial.
3.0,More for golfing in hot weather than going to a football game<br />Looked at 10 different caps and somehow picked exactly what I didn't want.
3.0,Was sewn together kind of wonky
3.0,3 starts only for the price
3.0,"good replacement, but they will scratch a little after repeated cleanings, only good for about 6 months"
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 & 135. & this was a little too short, width was great. Was still able to wear, but a little uncomfortable"
3.0,It‚Äôs for tall people. I had to do lots of alterations but good enough for the price. The quality doesn‚Äôt look that bad in the photos. The fake leather parts are very fragile so just be careful.
3.0,They begin to wear down to much within weeks.
3.0,"I like them and they look cute on, but I can't keep them from sliding down my nose.  It is really annoying.  I gave them to my daughter and she is having the same problem with them."
3.0,Love how it looks but i almost lost my watch because it easily came off my wrist a little disappointed on that
3.0,Order 1 size larger.
3.0,Be careful wearing these for too long at first. I tried to walk our block .9 Miles and the top of my foot is torn up. These flip flops are heavy due to the nubs and the straps really rub and pull on the tops of your feet. Probably should only wear them on occasion. Hoping it gets better.
3.0,And I ordered the smallest size.
3.0,Very cute for Halloween but might not last long as a dress up item. Definitely size up.
3.0,Fit was too small for the size
3.0,The style of the shirt is cute but the sleeves are a little short and the material is not the best but for the price I paid I don‚Äôt mind keeping it.
3.0,"The elastic shredded after wearing it three times. Love the bracelet, hate the elastic."
3.0,"Algo grueso el cuero, ser√≠a mejor m√°s delgado"
3.0,Cute but top was smaller then bottom. I even got 14 for my 8 year old after reading reviews but still was small and bottoms big
3.0,Cute but runs a bit small in the chest and armpit area. Returned
3.0,"I bought this set because I liked the vintage look of the shawl clip and the way it hung down.  But it didn't stay in one place and kept moving around so it looked strange.  Unfortunately another one broke, so I returned the set."
3.0,The set arrived without the tie.
3.0,"I was really excited for these bonnet's. They were so colorful. And when I received them they were very light weight. I live in Las Vegas, and it gets really hot. Some bonnets are really thick and make your head hot when wearing them. This bonnet glided on my head, but the elastic is so tight that it gives me a headache. I'm not really sure how to fix it, but I'm trying to stretch it out on other things.  It might work on a small head, or a child's head."
3.0,"My experience is that it has a Waistline is higher than most I've tried on. Unless you have flat abs, it will fold or lower itself in your pants."
3.0,This is a really cute novelty coat. However it is very thin plastic. I don‚Äôt expect it will hold up for long. But it‚Äôs cute enough to take some cute pix.
3.0,"Nice quality but too small and more maroon than red.  Sadly,  I will try to find someone with a smaller than average head to give it to."
3.0,This was extremely thin and see through‚Ä¶. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again
3.0,I ordered the same size I have always ordered from Patty. But this one was cut smaller. I guess it gives me inspiration to get off my butt and be more active. I do love the color and the texture.
3.0,"Disappointed that this mask does not allow for a filter to be inserted between the layers.  There are only two layers the outside print and a liner.  Will use as precaution, but not comfortable as a main mask for increasing protection."
3.0,"Fit is OK.  Color is a little off.  For the price, good to wear around the house."
3.0,"If you really want short swim trunks and you order these, I recommend you buy one size larger than normal, and note that the lighter colors may be somewhat see-through.  The material is good because it dries quickly, but the production quality is low (e.g., threads hanging off the hems and falling out during wear.)"
3.0,Much too small.  Go at least a full size up.
3.0,I am 5‚Äô2 and 135 pounds. I carry most of my weight in my lower body. I couldn‚Äôt get this dress over my hips. I ordered a medium.
3.0,"Order up, very thin almost see through, and tight! Wouldn‚Äôt wear out of the house"
3.0,Cute but much smaller than they look.
3.0,"I returned mine, it felt like plastic to me...  I have too much hair to hold with plastic."
3.0,Had to return since wanted a bit more oomph. Did not try on or remove adhesive so cannot attest to that. Ordered B cup.
3.0,Really cute but material was super static cling. I had to return my large because I couldn‚Äôt button over my chest(36D)
3.0,"The earrings I received are not even nearly like what is in the photo. The ones I received are not terrible, but bro! Why not display the real thing? And I am quite certain it‚Äôs a shot in the dark on what you receive, so even the ones I got might not be the ones other people who order get."
3.0,"We like the wallet, the first time we opened it the snap ripped, super glued it and working fine"
3.0,"I Didn't receive the draw string pouch that was advertised, it was going to be a GIFT for my husband but since i couldn't find what to cover them up with i just gave them to him like that..."
3.0,The green is pretty. Quality isn't great. It started to look worn after only wearing a week.
3.0,"My 5-year-old was so excited for these, but they‚Äôre twice as big as his normal sized masks. They‚Äôre the same size as my own masks so they definitely wouldn‚Äôt fit him."
3.0,Beautiful suit. I'm 5feet. 170 Ordered a large. It was too small. Didn't fit my breasts and butt
3.0,"well made and holds many items well, the only issue i have is the strap has broken and i cant fix it and theres no means of replacement, so thats my only complaint, how shotty the strap is made"
3.0,I went by the sizes indicated in the description. The dress is a pretty woven dress that I will have to wear a slip and strapless bra with. It runs about a size small. There were strings hanging everywhere when I pulled it out of the package.
3.0,Me gusto el color pero no la tela porque est√° muy transparente
3.0,Love the skirt except it arrived damaged. The clasp portion on the back only had one side in place so you can‚Äôt actually secure the waistband. :(
3.0,Nike has previously been doing better
3.0,"The dress looks better in the pictures than it does in real life. It's a good dress for hanging around the house, but not really for going out in."
3.0,I would need to size up 1-2 sizes from my usual to get the right fit.
3.0,"Not very comfortable and way too itchy. I bought the sized based other others reviews, which was a size smaller than suggested and still too big."
3.0,"The material and quality are great, but definitely order a size up."
3.0,"Padding is harder and thicker, needs to ride a 100k to evaluate"
3.0,"The little flowers come off very easily... But, it's pretty and doesn't tarnish and even looks pretty when missing flowers."
3.0,"I'm giving this sweater three stars simply because I do plan on wearing it and i think it looks fair.  HOWEVER, what I receive DOES NOT look like the sweater pictured.  The material is much thinner, and it does fit nor feel like the over-sized sweater that appears to be depicted in the pictures.  The thin material and the clingy design give this a much different look.  Like i said, I will wear it, but its not what i wanted nor what the picture shows."
3.0,I didn't like that polyester was not listed as being part of the material makeup
3.0,Cool and unique the only problem is that they constantly come untied.
3.0,Turned black..
3.0,They are not polyester as it says in the description. They are 100% cotton which I‚Äôm allergic to sometimes depends how pure of cotton it is and they will also shrink being cotton so I should have allowed for that with the sizing. I‚Äôm hoping they work out for me.  (XL)
3.0,"Member of a group that uses vests for uniform, we voted on this one.  Friend has an xl that almost fits around the midsection.  The 2xl doesn't fit around the midsection. The buttons seem really cheap and could easily fall off.  Couldn't get 3xl in black because it wasn't in stock"
3.0,Not true to size. order a size up or for a loose fit order 2 sizes up.
3.0,"I love it, but it's too small for my large ankle."
3.0,Fit good but tear easily unfortunately.
3.0,I need to return this item because it is too small than I saw at the picture so it is labeled probably and I like to return it
3.0,"The shirt was far too large. As it came from a foreign country, it was difficult to figure out the sizing. It also arrived very late."
3.0,"I  like this watch band very much.  It is comfortable and attractive.  But what attracted me to it was the way it looked with the matching watch face.  The product description said that one could ask how to download the watch face.  I asked in the question section above and was told in an email from Amazon customer service that I probably would not get an answer from the seller.  So as much as I like the band, I am very disappointed that I can‚Äôt purchase te watch face."
3.0,"Pretty stiff material. Not very comfortable. Wearing them anyway in hopes they soften a bit. They were only $7 so if they don't work out I can toss them without too much guilt. Good traction, for floor and feet."
3.0,"I'm always surprised that one of my colleagues who seem to be able to pack so lightly, yet he's got everything. Later, when we were checking out of our hotel room, I saw these smaller & different sizes of packing bags which allowed him to be more organized and still able to carry more essentials than just throw everything into the luaggages at random - not always the best use of limited space.<br /><br />Inspired by this and through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across & ordered this „ÄéBAGVIO Travel Compression Packing Cubes„Äèwhich had the color scheme that I liked & also quite a few positive reviews.

With only two cubes included, a large & small, it's just too few to properly organized different categories of items. I'd say, as a MINIMUM, a packing cube set must come in at least 4 different sizes to really EFFECTIVELY make a difference in the way we pack - I mean, do I really want to put my personal hygiene products with my socks & underwears (especially worn stinky socks üôÑüòèüòí). Moreover, despite the product description says ""compression"" cubes, the fabrics is basically loose canvas, unless you pack it to EXTREME tightness, the items inside still will shift around, again, defeating one of the key benefits of using a packing cube. In addition, the canvas material for sure will hold up to wear & tear over time, but the inside stitching may not - would've like to see DOUBLE stitching. Finally, as a value shopper (good stuff bought at a discount - isn't thusvwhy we love Prime Day?üòÇüòÖüòÇüòã), the price info is unavailable as of this review, so it's difficult to comment on the value of this but. In other words, if only two cubes but priced say, for the sake of argument, $10, then it's reasonable in value; $15-$25? Not so much.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />‚ûø„Ä∞Ô∏èüÜí‚ûø„Ä∞Ô∏èüÜí<br />If you only need a couple of packing cubes to help organize your SHORT travel packing, then this might do the job adequately. However, I tend to believe, if you even consider buying a set of packing cubes, you most likely are going on a longer trip & longer durations - needing more stuff in the process, then I'd consider other packing cubes options. This one just didn't do enough for me, unfortunately üôÑüòèü§îüòÅü§î<br /><br />üòèüòíüòí üòÆüò≤Not Recommendedü§´ü§´ü§êü§êü§ê"
3.0,Too many layers of heavy fabric for me and the front layer didn‚Äôt lay right.. returned it
3.0,"This watch looked really nice when it arrived. Came with a nice little velvet pouch as well. However, it started changing color to a brassy shade after my son wore it for the first time."
3.0,"This is a very cool looking mask. Downside, kind of hard to breathe through. I get it wet and that helps but still not the most breathable mask I own. The adjustability of this mask is great. I have a smaller head so it helps a ton to keep it on my face."
3.0,"I like the earrings BUT, the bar that goes into the ear is pretty thick. I bought these to put into my 2nd hole in my earlobe. Well it doesn't fit, and I don't want to force it through because, OUCH."
3.0,This is a heavy material<br />Best worn on cool days
3.0,Love the fit... The zipper needs a cover on the bottom as most front zippers do!  The rubbing has Rubbed in one use!
3.0,I was disappointed because I thought it was denim material but it wasn‚Äôt but I was willing to overlook but then the loose string all over the dress and I could imagine you need a good iron or steamer or else you would be wearing a wrinkled shirt dress.  I do not recommend unless you don‚Äôt mind cutting off the loose string and constant ironing then you can give it a try but I ended up returning it.
3.0,This dress should be comfortable for spring and summer
3.0,"Dainty little necklace and by little, I mean literally small. I am not a big person, at only 5 ft and small bone structure I'm very petite and this necklace was too small for me and didn't sit right on my neck. I gave it to my 11 yr old daughter."
3.0,It‚Äôs not faded like on the picture . It‚Äôs just solid color . Also it is true to size . If you would like for it to look like the picture order 1 size up . I am 5‚Äô2 and 106 pounds and I got a medium. üòä still nice without the fading.
3.0,"bought a med. way too large, looked like a baggy dress on me. It is going back, material is heavier than expected. Too hot for summer."
3.0,I have three stars because the pants were a lot smaller than expected.  The jacket was perfect and after alterations the pants were as well.  Great looking suit for the money if you are willing to do a bit of work for the perfect fit.
3.0,Not exactly what I was looking for. The gel is some what comfortable. The strap gets a little uncomfortable after a while though.
3.0,"I like the design, but they run small.  I can hardly get them on!"
3.0,"It's ok, but not really my style."
3.0,I did not find it flaturing On my body type so I returned.
3.0,Not as full as I would have expected but the price was good and it was nice to have a plus size option.
3.0,Didn't survive washing machine.
3.0,Really heavy material however it fit the occasion.
3.0,Poor production quality. Edges are readying fraying after removing from package. Pockets have holes.
3.0,Good Band for the price  quality is 75% out of 100  End links could use some work
3.0,Very pretty dress but too small in the top! Buttons pop open. I wear a size 12 in a top and had to return the dress. Size up one or two sizes if you have a large chest.
3.0,"Look cheap, feel cheap were cheap"
3.0,"I liked the bracelet but after less than a day use, it began to uncoil."
3.0,"Don‚Äôt like the material, but I‚Äôll find use of it"
3.0,beads started to fall off not the best
3.0,The shoes were advertised as new but arrived in a beat up box and were creased and scuffed showing that they had been worn.  Really needed them so didn‚Äôt want to take the time to return.<br /><br />The shoes themselves fit well and were comfortable when tried on.
3.0,Great bra. Cute.<br />Good for working out.<br />Thick padding.<br /><br />Problem though is I ordered a medium in a 2 pack and got one large bra and one medium bra...
3.0,The tie was ok but it was shipped in a huge box.
3.0,I ordered brown and blue suspenders and they both arrived on time but one of the 3 button straps from the blue suspenders has a manufacturers defect.  The strap has a visible weak point and will probably not last very long.
3.0,"The fit was great , but overall functionality was a no no for me.<br />I wore it and it looked cute , but probably not wearing it again due to the fact that I have to pull it off to go to bathroom.... What was I thinking....<br /><br />It shrunk a lot too when I washed it and the color sort of faded.<br />I loved the pockets thought that was good idea! I think pants or clothes should have pockets... but thats just me."
3.0,"These were only OK; the gold balls were not perfect and had some marks on them, so I ended up returning them and keeping another set that looked better. However, the set I kept ended up fading and had some elastic issues within 2 weeks without getting wet, so even though the others looked better, they did not perform well. I don't know what this set would have performed like since I did not ever wear them. I feel like all of these costume jewelry gold ball bracelets are not very good quality."
3.0,Bought for myself but my daughter (she is 7) is wearing it now
3.0,The color was a much lighter blue than pictured. Also the fit wasn't as flattering as the picture.
3.0,The dress hits at a very strange length that just doesn‚Äôt look right at all
3.0,I love the color and the fact that it fits nicely in my purse. But the umbrella itself is flimsy. It can't handle strong wind or anything like that. It'll flip inside out in an instant. Not something you want to use long term.
3.0,It was too small.. I thought that 1.1 MM would be larger....
3.0,Very soft but leaves pieces on your clothes so I returned
3.0,This is a nice product but it is much bigger than expected. The key ring was nearly impossible to put onto the key fob. Overall it's a very nice piece. My wife uses it and it's much easier for her to find her keys in her bag now. Not sure if I'd buy another one.
3.0,"The problem is that they lights come in a big plastic bag, some are ALREADY ON when the package arrives consequently the battery life is low or the light no longer works.  Luckily I only needed 25 for my goody bags.  A word of CAUTION the little top did fall off of some so I wouldn't recommend the item for small children.  Would I buy again? Yes, the price is not bad."
3.0,"There was a mix-up with the order, but the seller, was gracious and we were able to work it out.  I was satisfied.. üòÅ"
3.0,Returned. Didn't like the fit or the look
3.0,"This band is pretty cool. It's totally adjustable, since it's a magnet, which makes taking it on and off super simple, yet it stills stays put nicely.<br />My complaint which is the reason for the 3 stars, the metal links aren't closed- so it snags on EVERYTHING. Multiple shirts, my pants, even my hair has gotten caught in it. It's real annoying.<br />I like the design, I like the low profile of the band, but the links should be closed."
3.0,Decent watch but the directions are not good.
3.0,I was a little disappointed in these socks they did not meet my expectations. I thought they were mid weight socks turns out they are light weight. They do seem well constructed but I really need a mid weight sock that will keep my feet warm.
3.0,Each pair was labelled for the left leg.
3.0,(I got the 2x and I‚Äôm a 40d)<br />The fabric is nice but if you‚Äôre a D size you‚Äôll probably have spillage on the sides and top like me. There‚Äôs not much support and I got the largest size even though I‚Äôm usually a L/XL and couldn‚Äôt even fit a bra under it for more support.
3.0,It was way shorter than a similar brand dress that I ordered. I gave it away to someone who was shorter than me. I am 5'7.
3.0,Not bad overall but the ends catches on alot of things and the color is starting to fade after about 4 months
3.0,I normally where a XXL so I bought it in that size. I now where to lounge around the house or sleep. Almost big enough to where as a dress.
3.0,"This Dress looks really cute and I was so excited to receive it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package.  The dress is just like the picture.  Once I tried it on, it fit well everywhere but in the boobs.  It was so tight and the gold part fit on my boobs.  I was disappointed, but was happy to know that I could return it for free.<br />If you are interested, try it out, you have nothing to lose."
3.0,"It's comfy and casual.  I like it but when I am sitting down, the straps start to fall off mt shoulders."
3.0,"There are 4 side buttons to set/regulate this watch.  I find that I am bumping these knobs inadvertently which changes the time, makes it beep, turns it to international time vs. 12 hrs/day civilian time.  Also, the band is plastic -- and it doesn't stay strapped...for some reason, band slips out of band holster and somehow, just falls off."
3.0,Very thin fabric and wrinkled incredibly easy
3.0,I wish the fabric was softer because it‚Äôs a bit too hard for sensitive skin
3.0,"Son loves these shoes but the toe is already starting to wear through. Granted, my son drags his feet when playing but seems a bit excessive for how long we‚Äôve owned them."
3.0,The size chart is accurate. The material is as expected for the price you are paying. This is cute.
3.0,They seemed to fit until I washed them.
3.0,Sent it back. Way too small. Not only that it had a horrible smell.
3.0,It‚Äôs a smaller hat but still works for me. Wish the band inside the hat was not white. Looks kinda weird to see white through the green mesh.
3.0,"The material is soft and comfy. the shirt looks like picture. If I pay $35 for a shirt, however, I expect it to be well made. This is not. The stitching fell apart the first time I wore it- a cuff came off! I mended this within a week of purchase. I like the shirt, so it was worth sewing myself, but this should have better workmanship for the price."
3.0,The dress is too big for me.
3.0,This outfit runs big. I like the design just too large for me
3.0,"I wanted to like this so much, and it does look fantastic, but a huge problem is that because there are no structured shoulders, and there is much more fabric on the back, making the back heavier than the front, the whole piece tends to slide back. Even if you button up all the way up to your chin, the collar still slides back and puts pressure on your throat. Unpleasant. I have seen this being worn by others, and it looked awesome, but I found it too irritating to wear. Had to return, alas!"
3.0,The shorts were too small. The robe was ok but only the bralette fits as expected.
3.0,"The dress was beautiful, pretty good material. Absolutely no stretch, so make sure your chest measurements are accurate.  I ordered medium (as I usually do) and the zipper would not go past my chest area (34dd).  Also,  really long.  The waist line was lower than it should‚Äôve been.  However, that I could‚Äôve worked with.<br />If you are heavier in your chest area, definitely size up."
3.0,A few days after wearing this the black came off of the letters.  Still love it though. Needed something to wear at work that wasn't expensive incase I lost it or it got ruined.  Worked out great.
3.0,Very snug fit
3.0,"Cute dress, just too small"
3.0,Not bad for the price you pay.
3.0,"I love these and will order them again if mine fall apart! The only reason I removed two stars is because of how quickly the rose gold faded to yellow gold. I ordered this set specifically for the rose gold and was disappointed when it faded. It‚Äôs still pretty and subtle enough to not be super noticeable. I‚Äôll probably switch back to the silver, which doesn‚Äôt come in this set and I purchased separately. However, overall, these are great, tiny, easy to wear hoops. I have mine in my nostril and love the look."
3.0,"This is a very cute shirt, but the fabric is very very thin."
3.0,The set was cute but for the event I was attending it was ‚Äútoo‚Äù much. The skirt would rise as I walk so it‚Äôs not my favorite. The top however fit really well. It isn‚Äôt sheer. It‚Äôs a durable material.
3.0,"Perhaps , it is time for me to lose weight to fit into the medium size.... It was too tight for me . I wish I had ordered a large. But overall , it looks nice but the stitching could have been done better."
3.0,"Fit is fair except for the very tapered leg (too tight at the hem), washability is great, plenty of pockets.<br />I would wish for a wider leg at the bottom"
3.0,Definitely runs small. The quality is just alright. Looked like the front button was going to come off right away and there were lots of loose strings. Pretty much you would expect for the price.
3.0,"My younger girls wear them and they enjoy them , plan on swimming alot this summer so they came in handy"
3.0,Fabric was soft and thick but it fit shorter than expected which I did not love. I know some people enjoy a more cropped sweater- but I personally prefer it longer to be comfy in winter.
3.0,"This is very cute however it‚Äôs tight!  It looks like a flowing tunic in the picture but it‚Äôs not.  I had to send back and they were excellent to work with.  I may reorder in a larger size, Because of that!"
3.0,Works as claimed/designed.  Not a sophisticated product ... works the way it's supposed to work.
3.0,Received this dress ‚Ä¶and I am shocked it even made to be delivered given the packaging.<br />It was in a clear zip bag similar to a freezer zip lokck bag‚Ä¶you could see the dress inside and the bag was not sealed up.<br />I like the dress‚Ä¶but the packaging it is shipped in is unacceptable.
3.0,"Nice shirt. I‚Äôm a pretty big guy so I was expecting it to maybe just a little looser for a large. But I see I need an extra large. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a very nice shirt"
3.0,"Husband loves the amulet, but chain too small.  Wish it was sterling."
3.0,Gift for a friend the trinket itself is rather sturdy and durable but the chain is weak. May want to consider changing the chain for a leather strap or something as it will break sooner rather than later. Overall still good though.
3.0,"The material is meh, but it's a really good fit, I love the stretch, but hate that it's almost see through."
3.0,"Ok pants, but too small"
3.0,"Very nice necklace, but you have to be aware that the stone/charm is about as big as a pinky nail. The chain is nice and thick, and is choker length. Nice dark colored stone. I just wish it were at least twice the size. It's hardly noticeable as it is.<br /><br />It arrived in a nice little blue wallet."
3.0,My ladies with the big head....  Don't get a small üò≠üò≠ I'm hearing the medium is a bit to big so idk. But I bought the small and I thought it would be a little bigger.. I'm out here looking like Harry Potter lol. Came in perfect condition tho.
3.0,"The picture shows a solid color, the ones I received are not, they are a lighter color."
3.0,"Disappointed the lettering is not sewn into the hat, but printed  instead."
3.0,"Be aware these run very small, I guess they stretch and could fit but would be too tight and thin. - gave to the wife, she likes them."
3.0,"While the fit was what I expected, it's a weird material.  Not crazy about it but it's ok."
3.0,I've bought a lot of skirts from Amazon<br />This one is really short. I has to return it. It is a cute skirt
3.0,"This requires the individual to be able to hook the clasp rather than just pull on - very difficult for teenagers, or people with joint problems in their hands."
3.0,The inside of the mask irritates my face and it is not as roomy as the 3M K95 8210.<br />I will go back to using that mask rather than the new 1860.
3.0,"Very cute, pocket is sideways but that's fine."
3.0,"I really like the product, but they don‚Äôt last very long, at least mine didn‚Äôt. Not even 30 minutes after getting them, the edge started to loosen. I ignored it and put it back in my pocket. But then after an hour one side was completely off I tried to fix it with a lighter and worked but I switched to the black one. Same thing happened. I ended up throwing them away because they looked all messed up to me . Maybe I got lucky but if I can get them replaced I would definitely give them a second chance."
3.0,Looks cheap but fits well. Color is kind of an odd color. It almost looks green/blue.
3.0,It's smaller than it looks and the clasp sticks out on the bottom side. It's ok and I can't complain about the price so I'm not complaining but it's just ok.
3.0,"I bought these because I just moved into a house with all hardwood floors, and I needed some simple non-slip socks. My only complaint is  that the sizing is way off. The quality seems to be fine, they wash well, and the colors are fun, but definitely beware that these socks run on the small side."
3.0,"Was a short length than expected, so ordered a longer length to go with the cross."
3.0,The back is too long
3.0,"I did not expect it to be super fitted. Either than that it is a good shirt. If you are planning to order your actual size, maybe go up one."
3.0,"The boot fit well, not great, but well. They are nice looking out of the box and would fair well for casual wear.  As far as a work boot, not even close.  The minute you kneel down the toes collapse and if you work around concrete, the shell will not stand up to it at ALL."
3.0,"I did like the fact that it was sterling silver, however, the Ear Cuff was not large enough for my earlobe.  I was looking for an earlobe cuff to transform my pierced earrings to non-pierced."
3.0,After reading reviews I decided to go with medium. Should have listened and bought what is always get with small. I am 5.5 and 165. I usually wear small in workout clothes. They are nice but not compression.
3.0,Great material as I would get from his hockey association but he's 7 and these are smaller than his legs length. Unless someone packaged the wrong size in a junior labed bag. But they will work fine for practices and clinics. So not wasted just sizing is off.
3.0,Had problems getting the batteries to take a charge.  Over priced at $98.99 each.  I wouldn't tell anybody to purchase this item.
3.0,"These briefs ‚Äúlook‚Äù amazing...<br />But this company‚Äôs overall sizing runs EXTREMELY small.<br />If you regularly wear a small or medium size, you will hands down need to get the XL size. And they *still* will be snug.<br />Not sure what the deal is with that.<br /><br />The main issue with these briefs, is the ‚Äúgooch‚Äù area design. It is tailored very snug there (to make your butt look nice) but is a bit uncomfortable for the, ‚Äúboys‚Äù, if you know what I mean ;)<br /><br />If it wasn‚Äôt for that, these would be very nicely designed briefs and a keep for me."
3.0,Decent  Stylish.
3.0,"These aren't bad gloves for the price, but I'd prefer more padding in the palm. Also, the fingers are a little too tight for my hand. I bought the size XL, but don't consider my hand to be that big. You might want to size up."
3.0,"Nice colors. The straps are not long enough. It barely fit my head at the widest part. The first time I washed them, all the traps came out. Also the lining started coming apart. I currently wear them without the adjustable straps."
3.0,One bra cup was set higher than the other one on the band.
3.0,The necklace arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.  The &#34;gift&#34; box&#34; is a little plastic box with a clear lid and a piece of gray foam.  Definitely NOT something you would present to someone.
3.0,Supposed to be grey but it more purple. But otherwise its fine.
3.0,I like fabric of this dress . It is very good for summer. But fashion of dress disproportional
3.0,"This definitely looks like picture. But at a distance. 1st the pants are not wide leg, they are BELL BOTTOMS. Fits tight thru leg then flare out from knees.<br />2 The sheer and lace design. Very pretty. Hangs off shoulder.  The top is a little big, it is actually sheer with gold threading design. That's the front. Now the back, you can see actual stitches. It's not hidden well. It looks like a fitting more than done.<br />3. The Bottom is polyester. Yuck. If made with delicate material I probably given higher score."
3.0,"I really liked the fit and the drape, but maybe I washed it with the wrong set of laundry because now I have all these little link balls on it that I'm trying to deal with."
3.0,great quality but runs very small. Had to return it.
3.0,"Not long enough, should have a few more inches for us fat guys at size 38"
3.0,Very thin & not very stretchy.A waste of money.
3.0,"It is NOT sweatshirt material, more like a cheap polyester blend that has kind of a slick surface. The sleeve cuffs don't look the same or taper like in the photo and the neck hangs wider. I'm surprised the size fit as expected."
3.0,Needed to size up & belt not long enough
3.0,very cheap clasp for the price of this bracelet it should have a better clasp
3.0,"Really cute style, good fabric... But the army green color was more like baby poop green. Just pick a different color!"
3.0,"I ordered this in a large and I'm a size 8, it is still tight in the bust area.  The fabric is pretty, but so hot and fake - feels like wearing plastic wrap.  I live in Texas and I wouldn't recommend this for summertime.  It's a cute style, just order it way larger so it fits in the bust!"
3.0,"I had to return these. While they had the arch support that I like about the skechers, they were way too hard. I love the tone-up flip flops, but they are soft and I can walk on them all day. Also, while the tone-ups run big and an 8 works instead of a 9 (the sandals don't come in half sizes), the same is not true of these."
3.0,got the goggles when promised. I love the packaging as will help prevent getting scratched in my bag.  I have not worn them yet. that is why rating is what it is. Can't wait to try them.
3.0,"I got this for my wife since she loves pandas. As others have described, the robe is not as long as it looks in the picture, so my wife doesn't wear it outside the bedroom if she decides not to wear pants with it. She likes how the fabric feels, but because of the length she doesn't wear it often."
3.0,"Very scratchy material, otherwise it‚Äôs ok."
3.0,Definitely not Lavendar. It is blue with a tiny of Lavender. Picture is very misleading.
3.0,Not happy the color changed
3.0,"Color was nice, material was thick too.  It just looked very maternal and old looking."
3.0,These were larger than I expected and one of the earrings is missing the red nose.
3.0,Don't like very much
3.0,"They are pretty but they hurt my ears, are hard to get on and take off, yet somehow always seem to fall off unintentionally. But they are just simple little ear cuffs, so that‚Äôs about what you can expect."
3.0,"Fabric is hot, clingy too when ur body heats up."
3.0,a lil snug for my large face.  I think its more L than XL
3.0,"These would probably work OK on someone with small breasts who don't need much lift but the sticky stuff was already peeling off the fabric after first use and the tops (ears) did not stick at all and they didn't hold up any weight.  They really should be bigger around for support.  They also did not come with a reusable backing, I had to take a backing from some labels to store them in.  However they were very good at hiding nipples that are too prominent and that part was comfortable.  They did this far better than any I have found in stores.  I will probably cut off most of the ears and leave just a tab for peeling off.  The round part did stick well but is also already peeling on edges after one use.  Conversely the sticky stuff does stick to everything it shouldn't!"
3.0,not that pretty the color is not the same as picture and the material y not good
3.0,"The color was way brighter, kinda like a neon yellow and the chain was shorter than i expeted. Other than that its cool. I like it."
3.0,Too long for me
3.0,"Sandals footbed turned pale too quickly! But true to the Clarks reputation, it is strong and reliable."
3.0,not too pleased..
3.0,The product came and looks just like the picture.  I like the material it is made from. The size however is not correct.  It's is as if they tried to make a man's small into a women's large. They forget that women and men are not built the same!
3.0,It's is more like a crop top...not too flowy either! It is super cute and I'm wearing it for St. Patrick's day. I got an XL and I'm 5'9 180lbs and it comes above my belly button....gonna wear it with a tank top under it and a jean jacket and it will do!
3.0,runs very small--order up at least 2 sizes.  I ordered up 1 size--but still too small.  The seller was very good about giving me a refund.
3.0,"Didn't like color  - bad shade of pink.  Also, item was difficult to return.  Return label was very small, and I could not peel original mailing label off."
3.0,The warmth would be better if it fit the head better. It is a bit poofy on the top it would be a better fit if it wet a bit more form fitted to the head.
3.0,"It's ok for the price. I ended up returning. Way too big up top, but the material and pattern were very nice."
3.0,Size large is loose. Won‚Äôt buy again.
3.0,"Such a cute bathing suit. The bottoms fit great, love that they are adjustable, but the top did not fit at all. I also have silicone implants so that definitely changed the fit, but I don't even think it would have the ability to hold up natural boobs. It's a beautiful too, just didn't work for me. I'm keeping the bathing suit because I love the bottoms and will just buy a different top at VS."
3.0,"Very cute, but the quality is lacking it broke off half way through the ceremony.. we super glued it back on but I would say ehh."
3.0,I think it's pretty but it could be better quality visually. It also turns and twists and that bothers me because i like it to lay flat.
3.0,"I was excited for this magnetic option as I didn‚Äôt want to pierce my cartilage . They are a bit bulky . The problem I have ... after about an hour my ears hurt and I have to take them off . I don‚Äôt recommend these, especially for kids. Not a comfortable product. It‚Äôs ok to use it if you‚Äôre going out for a bit and want to put these on for like 2 hours . I don‚Äôt think I could stand these for longer than that."
3.0,"I love this dress!! The sewing is a bit rough as if it was hand sown but the size is true according to the description. The belt is short and thick, but imma find a cute ribbon or another belt that will go with this dress. Overall it is great for my small wedding!"
3.0,"It is a cute little dress, but a little too white and not as delicate a lace as I was looking for.  It's too late for me to return, so if anyone is looking for a size LARGE, it is available!"
3.0,Super cute and comfy.. only problem is i wear a medium so I ordered a large for extra room.<br />The hoodie size large fits more like a size medium.
3.0,"Fits as expected. Top is not stretchy, FYI! White parts are see-through."
3.0,"Just a weird wrap, it doesn't look like the picture unless you have no shoulders since it has to wrap once around you to get this look."
3.0,The ring was okay. It ran very small in size. I collect championship rings and it looks nice in my collection. I was expecting a rounded top but it was flat.
3.0,"These boots are well made but the opening is so narrow with the elastic not stretchy enough that they are difficult to slip on.  When I tried to return them, the company made it so difficult to return them I finally settled for a 40% discount.  That is why I only gave them a 3-star rating.  I am a disabled senior and found these so difficult to pull on I finally gave up and ordered a different boot."
3.0,"Fits fine for my petite body. But the front is a high boat neck. Too narrow to cover my larger chest so it‚Äôs a little awkward for me. May be better for a more petite chested person. I appreciate the cross back/ racer back design so I don‚Äôt have to worry about straps falling. The chamois is okay. Thinner so it doesn‚Äôt feel like a diaper. It works for my first bib. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 195 lbs."
3.0,NICE WATCH BUT I DIDNT NOTICE THAT THE GOLD COLOR ON THE BAND IS DARKER GOLD THAN THE WATCH BODY IS.  LOOKS LIKE 14kt GOLD COLOR ON THE WATCH BODY AND 18 kt GOLD COLOR ON THE<br />WATCHBAND.
3.0,I bought these socks to wear with my Chucks. Did not fit properly. I'll wear with my other tennis shoes.
3.0,Everything fit except the area that goes around the top of my chest/under my arms. It cut into my chest and was very uncomfortable.
3.0,Pretty color/pattern but fabric was not at all soft. Pajamas were stiff & not cozy. They were also quite long for me. I‚Äôm 5 ft and would have had to hem them to fit so l returned them.
3.0,"Its good quality,  I wanted belt with double stiched leather backing.my bad for not checking closer."
3.0,Beautiful belt but it arrived broken. I will be reordering another one because I believe sometimes things break in transits.
3.0,"The proportions of this set are really strange, and definitely not meant for anyone who‚Äôs very curvy. The material isn‚Äôt the best either. But the pattern is still adorable though, and I can‚Äôt make myself return it. I can probably wear the top and shorts separately with other stuff."
3.0,I can‚Äôt give full review even though the winder looked like it was good quality. It was delivered to me broken and without power cable so I couldn‚Äôt test its function. The manual could be better for a 500$ product.
3.0,"Size is a bit large, but the shoe itself is very nice. I'm rating 3 stars mostly for nearly nonexistent customer service. I hope that your shoe fits....good luck returning or exchanging it!"
3.0,"Has a weird cut, flares out at the bottom in an unflattering way. Large was too big, sized up based on reviews and it was too big. Didn't like the fabric. It's fuzzy but also kind of stiff? Not worth it."
3.0,Cute! But after one wash the blue dye spread to the sleeves.
3.0,The shorts fit me fine but the top is werid.  This is not worth what it costs.  The bottoms have a stretch waist band but the seam around the legs is tight and not stretchy. The top fit me but it just looks weird and cheap. It‚Äôs also very thin and see through which it‚Äôs lingerie so it‚Äôs not a big deal. I think it would only look good if your tiny
3.0,"Supposed to be different colors of semi-precious stones, looks closer to palest crystals. Not worth the $100. &#34;Prime lightening daily deal&#34;."
3.0,Good quality and made in the USA but not quick release
3.0,Only 3 starts they arrived the box was crushed and they have a scratch. Other than that they are perfect.
3.0,The chains all broke but I love the pendants and have changed the chains out over time
3.0,Glad it came in twos.  The first one broke after only a month
3.0,No room to give to put on. Runs tad small...when washed shrinks quite a bit.  Even when not put in dryer.  Had to order up a size due to shrinkage.
3.0,The sleeves fit funny
3.0,They look ok but was hoping for a more iridescent look. They are also pretty heavy on my face so they were constantly sliding down.
3.0,This dress may look cute on someone but it didnt at all on me. I am big chested. I wouldn't recommend to anyone that isnt flat chested because then it gaps open in a very unflattering way. The quality seems okay and the print is decent. But if you arent tall and flat chested then this dress doesn't fit right.
3.0,"The fabric is lovely and the dress is made very nice.  A friend, who is tall and thin, looks great in this sundress. If you have any width in the hips, this dress will be way too snug.  Too bad this is not an A-line dress."
3.0,On side tight
3.0,Look nice but super difficult to adjust. I have adjusted several watches but this one is tough. Might have to take it to a jeweler. It broke all of my tools while trying.
3.0,"Generally wore this for light-ish rains until I was caught in a heavier rain recently. When I got back inside, I noticed that I was wet, but only in specific spots. Turns out all my wet parts align with where the seams lie on the jacket. Somehow even the part at the hem of the jacket, where the drawstring is to cinch the jacket closer to your body, got wet inside where the cord is, meaning it's a wet ring clinging to my pants. I guess over the year or so since I've worn it (and only sporadically), the seams are coming loose, enough to let in water in heavier rains - or maybe it was never that particularly well sewn together in the first place.<br />Disappointing, since this has fit me pretty well as a heavy guy (5'9"", 225lb) in size L, and packs pretty light. Won't be buying this again."
3.0,"It was much heavier weight than I hoped, so it would not function well in Florida heat as a work dress. The chest region was too large, yet the dress was too fit around the torso before it started to flare out. It clung right to the area trying to conceal."
3.0,"I like this wallet..it is pretty, has lots of room for cards, cash & coins! The only problem is that it does not stay closed. I close the snapper but, it always come open in my purse!"
3.0,The bag looks exactly as pictured EXCEPT it is not as big. It‚Äôs still pretty cute and I plan to rock it soon.
3.0,Super cute just need to order one size larger
3.0,cute shirt but the waistline is short so most small moves and your tummy is showing
3.0,"These arrived very quickly, from England. While they are cute, they are just too big for my foot. They fit fine around the calf, but it's floppy and big on the ankle and foot. It's hard to find boots that fit me. I have a narrow foot, and a chunky calf, so wider calf boots generally mean wider foot too. One day I'll find my perfect Cinderella boot, it just wasn't today!"
3.0,Description says loose fitting but they are not. Kind of tight around legs. Other than that a nice pair of shorts
3.0,"Pretty good masks, but the colors they sent me didn‚Äôt match what I got."
3.0,"They work, but I wish they were more inconspicuous. I was hoping for something you don't notice unless you're looking for it. These are not clear, they are WHITE."
3.0,The product is as described but the chain is always getting rolled together. It doesnt sit as showed unless you are not moving.
3.0,"Received watch 1 as promised. It lost 20 minutes the first week. Seller responded referring to &#34;chains&#34;. I replied that I was writing about watch that didn't keep accurate time. Seller replied requesting picture to verify that wrong model was received. I sent picture. Seller sent reply about &#34;wood&#34; somethings. I requested replacement or refund for watch that doesn't keep accurate time again. Seller agreed and sent replacement that works fine. Price was good. Watch is thin and nice looking as described. Lucky I ordered watch well before my husband's birthday. If you have time, patience and like bargains this seller is right for you."
3.0,"Meh. Its ok. Kind of cheap looking and Im not sure if I will ever wear it out anywhere... but it might make a cute simple gift. I wasnt expecting much, it was super cheap. So great for the price. Nothing to write home about though."
3.0,Love the material but is too large for me
3.0,it's a bit tighter than expected.. the bottom really cuts on at the waist and the top chest looks like its stretched.
3.0,I am 5ft10 inches and I normally buy XL. I bought this item bigger as I wanted it to fit loose. I am very pleased with the look and would recommend getting one or two size up if you want a loose look.
3.0,It‚Äôs true to size and fits well. But the material is a bit thin and it looks cheap
3.0,It's feels very warm and it's made OK.. It fit OK..  But I'm not a fan.  Not crazy about the blue and there s way to much gold  in it for me. Just does not do it for me.
3.0,I had high hopes for this swimsuit top. It's simply too small. I even ordered it one size up & my DDD boobs still didn't fit in the cups. Had to send it back the same day i got it. Over all the top is super cute though.
3.0,Quality was ok.  Not real stretchy and ran really small.  Super cute though.
3.0,"The crosses are a nice size, but the colors are as vibrant as they appear in the pictures. Not sure if I will even give them as gifts."
3.0,This is a very cute top that is light weight and cute with the detail of the straps.  It was a bit smaller than I expected and a little fitted.  I ordered my normal size so I wished I had ordered up one size.
3.0,Love the bling. No pocket for filter
3.0,"I received the idem in a few days, the dress was too small on top. I had no problem getting a refund."
3.0,This was eat I ordered... But what i got was a skirts completely different from what I order..i give it a three cause it was a beautiful and it fits nicely..
3.0,"Needed 100% cotton, but received shorts that are 60/40."
3.0,"Upon opening there were strings all over.  The material is super thin and they look like womens shirts not mens. Bought for sublimation, print comes out crisp and clear though"
3.0,nice dress - just not for me.
3.0,"I liked it. It was hard to get the band off to charge it but quick charging. The face kept popping off, but usually popped right back on and worked great. The face popped off about 7 times before the screen failed."
3.0,Hanes has changed the design in these.  And they don‚Äôt fit like they use to.  The back seam in the crotch is open( not covered)  the seam is annoyingly noticeable.
3.0,It's very nicely made and stylish looking but was huge on my 3 year old son (who isn't very big but isn't tiny either).<br />Will probably reorder when he's 5
3.0,"Good laces - have button cell batteries which, as with all such items, are dangerous for children, becasue if swallowed, the chemicals can leak. (If swallowed, seek immediate emergency medical attention)  Would be better if had a screw holding it shut. On the other hand, is easier to open than another brand which has four screws holding it shut. So you have to take into consideration, and keep away from young children."
3.0,"No est√° del todo mal, pero no me sali√≥ como esperaba, la talla corre peque√±a, hay que comprar un size m√°s grande del que se est√° acostumbrando a comprar"
3.0,The bodice fit nicely and has a very classic look. I was swimming in the skirt and it made me look wide and hippy. I think the pleats add to the spread somehow. Nice material but it didn‚Äôt look right on me.
3.0,"I personally didn't like the length of the dress... it had went below the knee, and I like my dresses to be above the knees. Overall it was a good fit, I'm a very small person anyways so everything fits me differently. One thing I did like about the dress was the lace! I love some lace, and it didn't show too much cleavage either."
3.0,"Sz31, 8/10, 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 145lbs, bought lg, slightly loose in the caboose and thighs however I don‚Äôt have much of either (thin legs, square butt frame). I wouldn‚Äôt size down if I had a booty but I think that if I size down it be a better fit since I don‚Äôt. These make the butt look rounded not ‚ô•Ô∏è shaped. Cheaply made but cute. About 2in past my feet."
3.0,Cute but hard to get on and off
3.0,"Unfortunately, I did not realize that these gloves were shipping from China and although I was told they would arrive by October 11, they did not arrive until Halloween. The length of the gloves is great, past the elbows by about two or three inches. However, there is a strange packaging odor to the gloves I received. They are stretchy which is good but the top elastic band does not stay firm and the gloves kept slipping down my elbow, like most stretchy material gloves tend to do. Besides the delayed shipping I think these gloves worked for their one day purpose. Expect a long wait so order them with plenty of time."
3.0,"Very pretty and the clasp is very unique. That being said, any jarring of the clasp allows it to pop open. It latches on from both sides so you can open it from either side with this clasp. But if you bump it hard enough, one or both sides will come unlatched and then it's dangling."
3.0,seems rather loose fitting will see how it fits once laundered
3.0,Runs big. It‚Äôs a very weird material.. like a hairdressers apron. Not a huge fan
3.0,They look like the picture but they are so uncomfortable
3.0,I loved the shoes my daughter adores them it they are not hard wearing. Scuffing after a month.
3.0,Fit perfect except the boob part was a little tight. But I will make it work.
3.0,The fabric is soft but I don‚Äôt recommend those shirt if you are busty. I am busty and it felt to snugg. The fit overall just wasn‚Äôt flattering on. The pumpkin is cute though
3.0,Should be labeled as a youth hat it to small even on the lowest setting
3.0,"For sunglasses, these aren't too bad. I prefer the lighter gradient (gray) like these have, and when I am looking for a random pair for activities, I like the one-piece mold for the nose support instead of the nose guards on the glasses (so my hair doesn't get tangled).<br /><br />I'm not impressed with the brassy gold tone accents on the front. They are rather ""dramatic"" and they are not a good kind of fake gold color. I got the tortoise shell frames with the gray lenses, so a much more muted accent is much more in keeping. Additionally, I feel like the accents frame the glasses too much and make them seem smaller on my face. I will probably put these in the glove compartment and pull them out when someone is looking for shades to wear while with me, but these have not become my new faves, unfortunately."
3.0,I had high hopes for this after receiving a few other keychains from Amazon. This one is thin and fairly cheap in quality compared to the others.
3.0,Color was as expected. Light weight sweatshirt. If you are between sizes choose the smaller.
3.0,This item compared to others in the same size runs very small
3.0,Good quality and pretty design. Size ran small.
3.0,Constantly gets tangled. Looks nice when it‚Äôs not.
3.0,looks cheap and clunky in person
3.0,Rock too dark and not much sparkle
3.0,"These are actually pretty cute and a lot less junky looking than the picture depicts them to be- to be fair, I did buy them on dee discount and wouldn‚Äôt have even considered them at regular price. It was actually someone else‚Äôs review and ACTUAL photo that enticed me. That being said- in my personal opinion, to pull off this particular style, you need some curves, or they do indeed make you look like a 12 year old boy. However, you can‚Äôt be too curvy, because these run incredibly small. I‚Äôm a typical 8-10/large in bottoms and 5 feet tall; reading reviews I bought and XL. While I can get them on and could wear them as long as I didn‚Äôt sit down or eat/drink anything for the day, it‚Äôs definitely not comfy. I‚Äôd say size up, but if you‚Äôre a 10 or bigger just pass along. There isn‚Äôt any stretch at all."
3.0,I have purchased Lands End supima cotton in the past and the fit and quality of the nightgown was much nicer than my recent purchase. Very disappointed with the current downgrade in quality.
3.0,"It's may fault for not taking a much closer look at this wallet, but it's easy to miss if you're not paying super close attention.  The back of the wallet has a clear plastic window and in my view, it's a major negative.  This is only clear in one photo and the very end of the video.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice looking wallet, leather, two bill compartments, an ID flip out with clear plastic window, and plenty of room for credit cards plus 'hidden' slots for less used items.  Stitching and construction are nice and it presents well.<br /><br />However, the clear plastic on the back of the wallet REALLY takes this down several notches for me and gives it a cheap feel.  I don't want to be touching plastic when I'm handling an all leather wallet, and that's exactly what you get.  It's a shame because at this price point, it's a steal.<br /><br />So I think buyer beware of this feature.  For all I know, it's a selling point for people.  But I think a men's leather wallet should be all leather on the front and back, not covered with a large plastic window that takes up the entire back of the wallet.<br /><br />This doesn't work for me and I think it needs to featured a bit more prominently in the pictures and description so that a buyer understands their all leather wallet will not feel like an all leather wallet when handled."
3.0,They're ok but the little arrow design on the ear pieces was missing on one side.  I keep them to use as an extra pair.
3.0,"This fabric is not very giving, the light grey dress at least you want to wash all by itself it seems to absorb anything with color in the wash.... for a mom on the go this dress is just not very practical it has to be hung up right after it's been in the dryer, and almost always has to be ironed regardless- stiffer than I thought and I'm a 36 Double D so the large is not quite comfortable so it fits but it's pulling can't say that I wear it often ends up hung up in the closet due to not being very comfortable"
3.0,Not very stretchy and are very small
3.0,"Jacket is super comfortable and keeps you warm, however if your a large I would order an XXL. The XL fits like a medium"
3.0,"I've been spoiled by over 30 years of ROLFS key cases, unfortunately they are out of business. As this seems to be the only 8-hook key case on the market, not much choice. Not sure whether I'll actually use it when my last ROLFS wears out. Buxton also used to have a pretty good system though not as good as ROLFS but they have gotten out of the key case business; used them for at least 20 years before discovering ROLFS."
3.0,That I have a new housecoat that is bright and fresh.
3.0,My Daughter really likes how warm the fabric feels.  She likes the look as well. The only thing wrong is that the zipper didn't last long good thing it broke off on the close position.
3.0,"Product was received in good condition with no damage from shipping.  Comes with a nice case that is not too bulky and is quite fashionable.  Frames are good quality material, very flexible, and very cute (we purchased the white frame Hawaiian Floral motif style).  Lens quality appears fine - clear and non-distorting, but...  We purchased them for my two year old granddaughter and the frames will not stay on her face - they keep sliding down her nose.  She has to push them up every few seconds or so. We bought these because they were labeled ""Toddler Sunglasses"" and we assumed they would fit on a toddler.  Bad assumption, at least for our two-year-old.  They fit her head just fine - not too big, not too small, but regardless, they won't stay on.  To contrast, she wears her mother's sunglasses all the time and although they are certainly too big, they will remain on her face, perched atop her nose like they are supposed to. Unfortunately, these Polarspex will not.  Maybe if she was a little older (bigger head?) they would fit better, but in actuality, redesigning the nose pads would be a more robust solution.  As a result, we decided on a two star rating."
3.0,Too snug and not great quality
3.0,"These shoes were advertised as women's only we were shipped men's. They were too big and after trying to order the right pair 3 different times, I have up. Disappointed the sizing was wrong too. They aren't true fit."
3.0,Fit well but didn‚Äôt hold their shape.
3.0,"After a few washings, lost it's... tautness, not baggy and loose."
3.0,"Ordered two, one for me and one for the wife.<br />My jacket, I am an XL so went with the 2X per their chart, as stated in other reviews all fit well with the exception of the stomach area.<br />Wife's jacket, ordered the smallest jacket they had, still a bit big..<br /><br />Quality, not that good, will never be a every day jacket, stitching is poor (only single stitched) and leather is thin.<br />Great Show piece if that is what you are looking for.."
3.0,"I like that there are two pockets on the shorts but the pockets are too high on the shorts showing bulkiness under the skirt AND the shorts ride up.  Not suitable for running, dancing, etc."
3.0,I wanted to love it but the fit runs large. Returned it and didn't buy a smaller size.
3.0,Smaller than expected.  Zippers stick.  Mesh gets in way of closing.  Colors are fun.  Name has ‚Äúho‚Äù in it - fun joke with friends that I‚Äôm a ho.
3.0,The clock itself is excellent. The chain itself is a little long and breaks easily. You have to be careful about that when wearing it.
3.0,The shirt is nice. The sizing is different so if you get a big size you will not appreciate the cut on your body.
3.0,"Whether a fan of the Washington Wizards or not, this is a decent t-shirt. It‚Äôs black and has the Wizard logo trimmed in a thin red line. It fits true to size and looks great with jeans. The only warning that I will provide the purchaser is that this it does shrink a little, so be careful when washing. **I also received a Boston Celtics t."
3.0,"This would be a great bra, if I had received the 30 E I ordered. Instead, it was a 30D. I am sick of sending things back. So, I am lucky my daughter wears this size. I gave it to her."
3.0,"Fun socks - husband likes them. This is the second pair I‚Äôve ordered. However, they took FOREVER to arrive - much past their estimated delivery. The status finally updated to say they arrived ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù but we only just received them."
3.0,"They're gorgeous, but yikes, they're small. I wear a true 8-1/2, ordered size 9. Very excited to receive them. Could barely get them on, too narrow by far.  :("
3.0,"I didn't realize there was a serged seam down the side, which makes it look a little Wal Mart. Otherwise it's super cute!"
3.0,"Very nice, BUT, length was NOT true.  If ordering, size up 1/2 &#34;"
3.0,In person this looks diff. The neck is higher. It just doesn't sit well on my body.
3.0,It‚Äôs alright. Slightly boxy and the material isn‚Äôt great. I would‚Äôve know this had I known the seller would just send me a Shein product.
3.0,"Too hard to get right size.  Even the Solar Shield web site didn't really help.  I have had several of these and they are a good product, but the sizing is difficult without trying on several on my glasses"
3.0,"It might have been intended to fit like a belly top but it was shorter than I expected,  I'll still wear it as I am not tall and it is cute and good quality"
3.0,I tried three times to get shoes to fit but even the 2XX is too small for a man with a high arch.
3.0,"Honestly, I wanted some nice dresses for a trip to Hawaii this spring.  The dress itself is really cute, with a nice floral print and a great fit that gives you coverage without drowning out your shape completely.  I just find the material to be strange and now wish I'd gotten something that is more t-shirt or cotton type of material."
3.0,I did not try on this dress. I was so put off by the colors presented on the website were not what I received.
3.0,It arrived stained with ink from the t-shirt itself. I don't like it like this.
3.0,The quality of the shoe was ok.
3.0,I did not really like the martini setting but may appeal to other people.  The color is a dark golden imperial topaz color.
3.0,Frumpy.  Boxy.  Thin.  Was so looking forward to wearing this dress.  Not so much now.
3.0,"I get alot of compliments on my bag. But it's cheaply made and pieces have fallen off within 2 months time, and minimal usage."
3.0,They work but photo ia deceiving. The face on it has a couple inches of black over the top part and its hard to get is exactly as shown. They still work for coverage but not what i was expecting.
3.0,"It is good, but the colors of the wings are black and light grey not silver which means, without a good reflection of the light bothe wings colors will appear the same."
3.0,It was an ok bracelet.  Not completely happy with it but it will do. Won't buy again tho. Thank you
3.0,"These are nice, not the best quality, but was a nice gift to my youth group."
3.0,Chest straps are actually half the fabric that it shows in pic so it barely covers nips
3.0,She loves the shorts but unfortunately the pink ones she wore one day only  and the white trim literally came undone from the shorts in the back so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll order again.
3.0,A very small umbrella suitable for keeping your head dry in the mist.  It doesn't cover much else.  I sent it back.
3.0,"Very Nice look, need to be a little easier to read and strap on watch seems a little small fittings."
3.0,Super cute swimsuit but it was too small in the bottoms and slightly too big in the top...of course! The top is loose which causes nip slips and under boob.
3.0,The material is very cheap...and has all but faded completely. I wouldn't waste my money buying this.
3.0,Delivery fast and easy refunds. However glasses were bigger for my face so didn't like select glasses as per your face and frame.
3.0,"I ordered two by accident, but I had a friends birthday coming up so I told myself I'd give it to them. When I received them, the first one was lovely, the second had the silver paint scraped off most of it. Buy with caution."
3.0,"I'm a small and therefore ordered the small size for this tank top. Upon trying it on though, it was obviously a little too tight. The length is also a bit long so it ended up tight and uncomfortable. I needed a yellow tank top in a pinch so I couldn't do much about it, and it's more or less a one-time wear situation (bought it for Comic Con). However, It would have been nice to have a yellow tank top handy for other needed opportunities."
3.0,Very nice size purse. Down side is the chain nor the logo of the bag can detach. This is something that should be listed in the description!
3.0,"Fits as expected, but is EXTREMELY sheer; that is not shown well at all in the pic."
3.0,"Love the print material super soft & would be very comfy, but entirely too big!  I usually wear a large but got an Xl simply don't want them to fit like jeans... I probably could have got by with a MEDIUM, that big."
3.0,Thin fabric. Great for a chill but not necessarily the cold.
3.0,"Wide brim for Woody perhaps. For an adult the brim is not wide enough. It's made out good material, the backflap offers decent protection and the front face cover is alright, but it gets all over when walking around. Having bought other hats from different sellers, this one is my favorite. I would just actually make it wider and improve the front flap from flying around all over your face."
3.0,Shirt is good quality but fits small and short in length
3.0,"it is ok , expected to be better quality"
3.0,"These are not actually polarized. I have other polarized glasses that have come with cards in which something extra shows up when you wear polarized glasses. These cards do not show anything different with these glasses than they do without glasses, though they do for glasses that are actually polarized."
3.0,Great idea but the size is really little
3.0,"It came a little later than expected but I did get it! It's long like in the picture but just a warning, it's not made for &#34;busty&#34; girls. It's pretty snug around the chest area but other than that, great fit."
3.0,The idea is wonderful but my son disagreed and always manages to pull it off
3.0,A little weird fitting in the breast area. I'm a bigger girl and my breasts did not feel supported.
3.0,"Each slipper was slightly different in size.  One pair would be slightly large, and one pair slightly small. The issue with the size being that they have a tendency to slip off.  Other than that, they are incredibly warm and comfortable.  I LOVE the patterns and quality of the fabric.  I would have given 5 stars had they felt more secure around the back of my heels, which would have prevented them from slipping off."
3.0,Es de una tela muy sencilla
3.0,"It came in Amazon Prime fashion - surprisingly fast.<br /><br />I wore it for a night out and got many compliments on it. Its made of stretchy material that fit pretty well. It felt a bit on the cheap side, but it looked great.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it a lower rating is because after I washed it. The seam ripped in the crotch area and I am now unable to wear it. It was really upsetting cause I liked how it fit."
3.0,I haven‚Äôt had it long and the seams are already tearing
3.0,Slightly disappointed - the lilac lens color is not vibrant like the photo.  These were purchased on a prime deal discount and arrrived in time.
3.0,I'm not crazy about this hat. I will end up donating it.
3.0,decent quality but the size range doesn't go up as high as they say. I'm at the upper end of the range and they are quite tight.
3.0,"The quality of materials and finish is not great and to be honest the boots look cheap for $20. The sole isn't glued property to the upper part and there is a gap between the two, especially near the toe area, its just poor fit & finish and not top quality manufacturing. The boot was also slightly larger than we expected (size 9). The I would spend a few extra dollars next time and get a proper boot."
3.0,"the design is good, but the chain fell of twice, and the clasp fell off once...the first hour."
3.0,"Nice elegant dress, bought for an event but came with a hole in the side seam. Runs small so order up."
3.0,"They're very cute, but difficult to adjust for skinny fingers"
3.0,Was trying to get light colored material for being out in the sun. What came is darker than what is pictured for sale.
3.0,"I like that it‚Äôs easy to stow in a pack and always have handy. Doesn‚Äôt replace my more stylish jackets, but works with them as a liner. Not super hot, but takes the edge off while waiting for a bus. Sadly, I only got two full charges out of the battery before it completely died. Contemplating whether to buy a different product or spend another $50 on a replacement battery."
3.0,Cheaply made and not all of them fit
3.0,I ordered one of these and it fit my husband instead very well. It runs large and it had some type of smell. Not good smell that is.
3.0,"Cute, the nose pads are too far apart though, so the bridge between the lens rests on your nose. Kind of uncomfortable."
3.0,This dress was very pretty and I would go a size down and it is very long. I am only 5 foot 5 and I was walking on it
3.0,"SUPER DISAPPOINTED in fit!!! I followed the size chart and they are SUPER small. Material is so nice!<br />If I hadn‚Äôt already taken the tags off and washed them  before attempting to try them on, I absolutely would‚Äôve returned them.... Maybe, the company will be kind enough to send me the biggest size"
3.0,Pretty but a material is a little thin and snug
3.0,"Then necklace arrived with some damage..stones missing, and bent tassels..<br />I will not buy anything like this again. Disappointing to say the least."
3.0,Nice jacket but has an issue in one sleeve. The fabric is either twisted or sewn in where it shouldn't be making that arm a tight and uncomfortable fit.
3.0,This shirt is really soft and comfortable to wear. One thing I didn't notice before purchasing is that it's not just the sleeve seam that's outside. The neck and hemline seams are outside. And so is the seam going across the front between the 2 colors.
3.0,I like the style of this dress but the material is thick and heavy.
3.0,Not better than a cotton pajamas from Target.
3.0,Pants are awesome but $25more for my size made it very difficult to justify.
3.0,"Way bigger than it was supposed to be, but I expected that from looking at other reviews. Other issue is, the graphic on it isn't placed quite the same -- it's much bigger and lower so i don't see him being able to wear pants with it if i want the words to be ledgable<br />Otherwise great material and so cute"
3.0,I wanted a small purse and this one is not small.  over all it is a good purse well made just not what I wanted at the time. Kept it because it was a good purse!
3.0,the white pants tag says 100 % cotton. I washed in warm water and put in hot dryer. Not much shrinkage.<br />Whte pants are see thru. Must wear white undergarments.<br /><br />I'm 5'5 and I got the large. They come down a little below my ankles. After washing they are up right at my ankles.
3.0,"Good product, just make sure you order a size up. I normally wear XL, but this fits like it's from Baby Gap. I guess it would be great for a skinny guy"
3.0,"just doesn't hold up .The two strap holders lasted only 3 times of taking the watch off then broke, no good as far as I am concerned."
3.0,"Cute print, silky like texture leggings. Print will expand when put on. Type of material that turns white when bending over or pulled tight over thicker parts of body."
3.0,"the bag it self is okay, the strap is actually thin & flimsy."
3.0,"Although these gloves keep my hands warmer than my last gloves, they leave a lot of black lint on everything which drives me nuts. My fingers still get cold especially the thumbs."
3.0,"Very pretty dress, just small in the chest area."
3.0,"Fits, but WAY shorter than it looks on the model. For reference, i‚Äôm 5‚Äô 10‚Äù."
3.0,Nice design and texture BUT color is more like light purple.
3.0,Fabric was too thin and transparent. Also was little small according to the measurements given.
3.0,poor quality construction and material.  It was returned
3.0,Pants are extremely long!
3.0,"Ordered a second  time and requested 2 of the Love bracelets. Received 1 Love and 1 of something else. The second bracelet was s little smaller so it fit better but not what I ordered. The Love bracelet is very large and I can't keep it on.<br /><br />Love the bracelet BUT it's too large for me, falls off. I would order more if they were a little smaller"
3.0,"Color is much more saturated in person, slightly pink bubble-gummy. Beautiful quality but I‚Äôll be returning. Fits as expected; just like all of Patty‚Äôs sweaters."
3.0,sefsefsef
3.0,"I loved the look and overall fit of this dress. However, I found it to be just a tad bit too short. Maybe if I had &#34;legs for days&#34; this would've been perfect! However, the long sleeved lace is beautiful!"
3.0,"This is a really cute shirt.  I ordered the wine color in medium based on previous reviews.  The color and quality are OK but it's just way too big.<br />I usually wear size 0-2 or extra small (I'm 5' tall, 95 lbs.).<br />I wish it came in a smaller size.  If you're petite it will NOT work for you."
3.0,Beautiful to but no hemming and sticks to everything.  Extremely delicate.
3.0,Fits very wide and very short. Kind of like a men's crop top.
3.0,The sizing is wayyyy off. Xxxl means size 12 women's .
3.0,I've used this for a couple of weeks now and it works okay I would say it's extra help but it's the exercise and dieting that really gets rid of the fat. I don't sweat as much in it as I thought I would however I tend to sweat more with it than without. I like the zipper instead of pulling it over the head like some but the zipper tends to get stuck in places a lot so it can get frustrating.
3.0,"Bought these for my husband to be able to wear a ring at work, they are nice but they are small for his finger and too tight."
3.0,"If you have a very small head it will be to big. I have a small head fits ok until I pull on the strap than it looks awkward due to the large brim I'm 5ft and my friend is 5&#34;7 and has even a smaller head, didn't look good on either of us. Unfortunately I missed the return option by 1 day."
3.0,"Cute, not that comfortable"
3.0,"I LOVE this bra. It is exactly what I wanted, it fits great (I'm 5'5&#34;, 105lbs, 32A or B). However, after the first wash (on gentle, no dryer) a hole appeared on the back. I would have given it 5 stars, except the quality is not what I expected."
3.0,Runs a little small and pretty tight. For the most part looks like the picture .
3.0,"Nice colors....but not the fabric I expected... they are too thin and slippery, you have to keep fixing the scarf as you  walk, they are more on the silky side than the linen side. The packaging is beautiful"
3.0,"It's okay.  It smelled of plastic for the first few days and then smell went away.  It is a smaller than I thought and putting things in and taking things out is difficult (i.e. wallet)  But, It is pretty."
3.0,Didn't like the fit. Ran a bit large.
3.0,"Idea is nice however implementation is not the best.  While it is thin, the material feels cheap and is rather sharp around the edges.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to me is the gigantic money clip attached.  That totally takes away from the minimalist concept to have that clip on the outside sliding up and down your pocket.<br /><br />If you carry that much cash, or use it to hold a lot of cards, you‚Äôve defeated why you want a minimalist wallet to begin with.<br /><br />I too think the straps that hold the sides closed will stretch and loosen, inevitably failing after time."
3.0,It's just okay.... looks a little cheap in real life.  I thought it was made of cotton but I must have missed the product description because it's actually made out of this stretchy polyester type material.
3.0,Short dress and very see through. Came a lot Pinker that the pictures shows.
3.0,"Sizing - The L/XL fits, but if they had just an XL size, I would have gotten that. My measurements fit squarely in the XL range, and I'm very tall too, so the fact that they do fit is pretty cool. They are just a tad tighter than I would prefer, which may affect the squat test. The waistband is okay, in just the right spot it's flattering, but it can dip into not so flattering places.<br /><br />Sheerness - They are fairly opaque, so neutral colored underwear is hidden. But they won't hide bright red, even before the squat test. Again, I think the sizing, at least for me being on the upper end of this size option, may not help so much.<br /><br />Material - I haven't had seamless leggings before, but these were a bit more like tights-type material than I thought they would be. They had just a few tiny snags in them when they arrived, and look like they have the potential to easily get snagged. I've worn them a few times, and there have been no more snags, and the existing snags haven't gotten any worse.<br /><br />Overall I like them, they are comfy, the color is nice (a bit greener than they look on my computer), they are long enough for a 6'1&#34; girl (just barely), and they didn't give me camel toe.<br /><br />UPDATE: I must have been in poor lighting before, these are sheer with just white underwear, even without squatting. On the other hand, my prickly cat has failed to cause additional snags, and there were a few times that I was sure they would snag. Going down to three stars for the sheer fabric."
3.0,"A bit too small and tight for the size I ordered! I did use their sizing chart as well, so I didn't order blind."
3.0,"Bottoms almost too big, top way too Revealing for DD but a cute bathing suit, I wish the top was as big as the bottoms or we could buy separately."
3.0,This was GREAT fun to wear but the gold pieces kept falling out.
3.0,"Runs small, but comfy, not thick"
3.0,I think this outfit is super cute and I am happy with the purchase. The reasoning for the 3 stars is due to the fact that the skirt material is very thin and falls apart easily (had it less than 2 days and only tried on once and a seam started fraying). If the skirt were a different more durable material I think it would have been better off. The outfit itself looked exactly like the picture though!
3.0,"I usually buy this same bag, but made by reebow tactical gear. The reason i bought this particular one was because it has the rain cover. I can definatively say that the quality of the reebow brand is superior. The stitching on this bag is the only problem i have had. Light use and already have stiching falling apart. One of the internal pockets has completely torn apart from the bag. I have not had an issue with the small pouch that is included, but i only keep my phone and a few other light items in there."
3.0,"I brought it for my id holder, it was nice for awhile then it broke!"
3.0,Fabric doesn't maintain its shiny luster
3.0,A bit fragile...the brown are kind of hard to see through. Have to sit on my nose. I‚Äôll wear them for photos but not for function
3.0,"Cute style and great size. However, the glasses broke within two days."
3.0,"I like this necklace except the flower came more yellow than in the picture. also the material is pretty cheap, but i guess you get what you pay for..."
3.0,"They look super cool, but they're only so-so as sunglasses. The biggest annoyance for me is that they are CRAZY reflective. When I'm driving I can just about literally see what's behind me without turning around. Its super distracting, and as a result I never wear them."
3.0,"For the price, they're fine. Bought two pairs, in series. First one lasted a year before the frame broke. Second one broke in the same way after 3 months."
3.0,Zipper was broken and had to be fixed. There was not enough time to reorder another or send back. Three stars are for the fast shipping and the dress is beautiful!
3.0,Runs a little small and is extremely short. I'm 5'7&#34; and this barely covered my butt. I bought the cream and it's kinda sheer. The pleating starts right below my boobs and gives a pregnant look so it's not too flattering either.
3.0,"El el√°stico molesta en las orejas, no es una mascarilla c√≥moda"
3.0,"This product is very difficult to open, and the hinge irritates my skin. If I wear the ring for too long, I always get a scab on my nose from it (I have a septum piercing)."
3.0,"SO BIG. I even went to the Anvil website and looked up the sizing chart there before I ordered, and measured myself compared to the sizing chart, because I always have a problem with clothing not fitting as expected when ordering from Amazon. I ordered this Hoodie, and 2 different T shirts, all are too big. I suggest ordering 1 to 2 sizes down.<br />That being said, this hoodie is otherwise as expected; very lightweight and of passable quality. That's what I expected for the price and brand."
3.0,"this swimsuit fits pretty tight...I got a large keeping the Asian sizing in mind. I am a 36C and usually a medium bottom. The top fits perfect, but the bottoms are a bit too snug for my liking. Also, the top doesn't have that much padding. it's a good Triangl dupe, but there needs to be more padding."
3.0,Very pretty but the arms are very tight and there is NO stretch in the fabric.
3.0,I received the wrong color Keychain and the packaging was damaged. Other than that everything looks fine.
3.0,Cute but they run super small üòí sad I missed my return window
3.0,It's a cute dress but sort of cheap feeling. The inner slip is very transparent so you'll probably want to wear your own slip. Also it's a bit short so potential for ride up is real. I'm returning it mostly because it's much too long for me (I'm 5'2). I don't think I have tall enough heels to make the skirt clear the floor.
3.0,"This top is too short! I expected it to fit longer than it did, so I returned it."
3.0,Bought my boyfriend this. fit him pretty good. but was a lil big. but didn't come with anything to make is smaller.
3.0,"The fit is great, but the material is a little cheap. Overall I only sorta like it. The top is a little see-through and I‚Äôm pretty sure it won‚Äôt last too long."
3.0,I really wanted this to work for me but it was just too tight. I have size 35 waist and got the large but my arms felt like they couldn't move. It did pull my stomach in but as you can see from the photo I still had back rolls. If you are in between 2 sizes based on the chart I recommend sizing up.
3.0,Check size of ball carefully. These were smaller than I thought so I returned them. Quality was good but too small.
3.0,"I bought a large and it fit tight across my bust.  Cute top, bought in purple in which I didn't really like the color or the fit. Returned."
3.0,I ordered an XL thinking it would be stretchy and was not. It‚Äôs not stretchy at all.  It‚Äôs hard to get in the dress.
3.0,They were in such a small pkg that i accidentally threw them away.<br />My daughter was sad. :(
3.0,"Loved the pajama pants, but after one wearing they ripped at the seams on one leg."
3.0,It is really hardto close it back to its original form.
3.0,"I was very excited to receive this ASAP. Looks very trendy in the photos! From the pics I got the impression that the material was sturdy but also kind of silky which would make it look so much better in pictures. When it arrived I was kind of disappointed with the first impression. The color was off, there was a darkish stain on one side and something that looked like lipstick on the inside. Also one of the sides (left) where they have the scrunched stitching was coming loose and wasn‚Äôt as scrunched as the other side. Once I put it on I could still see the stain and for some reason the left side wasn‚Äôt scrunching correctly. I tried various types of wraps and they all look cool and the material isn‚Äôt see through which is comforting. It‚Äôs also very long wraps around my body about 7 times which is cool because you can make new styles. But real question is... is it worth the price? For that price I would expect the package to have some sort of ‚Äúguide wraps‚Äù also I would expect the wrap to be clean and brand new. I think they should lower the price."
3.0,Looks bigger in the picture than in person.
3.0,I really like the skirt-for that 5 stars.  Will be perfect for our hot Florida weather.  But there are holes in the seams where they have not been sewn up correctly 2 stars deducted for that.  Thankfully I can sew them up myself but quality is disappointing.  I was going to buy another pattern but now will pass.
3.0,Sound quality if fair ..... but you can't be TOO far such as 5 feet from your phone or you'll lose connection and not made for people with big heads
3.0,"Very pretty and simplistic!<br />Definitely Asian sizes though, I ordered a size up and purchased a x-large instead of a large but they were still way too small!"
3.0,"There is a thread flaw towards the middle.  It is very visible.  I was just upset about that, other than that it is nice material."
3.0,Too small. Has no fly opening. Fits too tight.
3.0,This is an ok dress.  I can't say I love it or hate it.  I'm not in love with the material and it ran small.  I usually order larger because items tend to run smaller when ordering off Amazon.  I ordered a large and it's fits but just a little tight in the hips.  I'm 5'5 and around 160.  Not crazy about the ruffled look kind of like a prairie dress or something.  It's ok.
3.0,Cute but it is brown not white and can't be considered an infinity scarf since its so short you can't wrap it twice.
3.0,looks great ..however should've been a little bigger
3.0,"Overall happy, but I got 3 cats and 1 unicorn instead of 4 cats"
3.0,The size chart isn‚Äôt accurate. I usually buy a medium ( size 10) and weigh 160lbs. Based on my body measurements i was directed to a xl. Way to big. A medium would have fit better.<br />But overall the quality and look of the dress  is as expected.<br />The dress fits my mom perfectly who wears a 14w.
3.0,"It‚Äôs alright, at least it‚Äôs breathable. False advertisement, no filters/ sponge  just the cloth cover your face better then nothing"
3.0,I gifted them they were too long for me . Very pretty.
3.0,"I love these , the only problem is the clasp and chain. I have to replace them, they break."
3.0,Please read the description before you buy. Not what I thought it would be
3.0,"These are very soft and comfortable, however, there is NO support at all so if you're looking for control leggings, these wouldn't be a good choice. They also snag easily...I went outside to grab firewood and the wood created &#34;pulled&#34; areas where it had touched them."
3.0,Not a quality product but good costume jewelry.
3.0,It's an eyebrow kit. It does what It's suppose to do. That being said you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Material: It's a mix of extremely cheap plastic and metal. The scissors are a bit awkward as it's also a cheap metal and has a hard time opening and closing.<br /><br />The razors are a very very light weight and hollow plastic<br /><br />But the tweezers are a nice thick metal.
3.0,"Beautiful watch and does its job. Extremely easy to operate (old school). But if you accidentally drop it, might as well just throw it away - ‚Äúcrystals‚Äù fall off into the hands preventing them from moving. For $9 though, not a bad looking watch for a night or a week. Just dont drop it or hit it."
3.0,"As you can see from the picture I thought this watch would have a luminescent display with all of the numbers, markers and LED letters and numbers glowing in a rich bright green color.It did not and the backlight could barely light up the LED sections. The dial color was only brown and the LED sections were difficult to see and impossible to see at night.I did like the way the watch felt and looked on my wrist.I plan on purchasing one of the other styles that will definitely have the green glowing display. But, PLEASE take this picture off of the internet adds, it's just TOO misleading and disappointing to get in the mail and only have to return it."
3.0,"My husband loved the shirt but it was way small,  but my son could wear it and loves it so we kept it"
3.0,It's cute but the chain part is really weak. I sneezed today and it just broke right off. I was able to fix it pretty easily though. Since the chain was so weak I could just use my finger nails to pull and bend the chain links and reattach it.
3.0,They were suppose to be narrows and they were not.
3.0,"If you put as many items in the main pocket as it says you can, folding it is impossible, but I'm living with it not folding, by putting a rubber band around the main pocket to keep the contents from falling out. I have my cards divided in 3 different holders, different colors."
3.0,"I expected a color like to picture (rose) but I received beige almost brown, but was not like I saw in photo!!"
3.0,I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and a small in every brand. I read the reviews and decided to order a size up and got a medium. It is so small I thought it was a children‚Äôs size. It‚Äôs a nice sweatshirt but you‚Äôll need at least two sizes up.
3.0,I had to return it right away because it was super tight. A 2XL fits more like a Large.
3.0,"It looks great, it fits snug.  I need to lose 10 more lbs for a nice smooth none bulge look.  Buy one size up."
3.0,The ring is cute but the stone is definitely fake and it‚Äôs HUGE.
3.0,Does not stay together
3.0,Cute ish
3.0,I like this watch but the yellow wasn't really what I call yellow. I gave it away; I have a red one that I kept.
3.0,"It is nice style but it scratched my little toes, and the insole is not padded enough to me."
3.0,"Bought a pair for my wife, she already owned a pair of tangerine telic flip flops and loves them so I thought she would like these. Sadly I didn't realize the flip flops were unisex so the z straps were just a bit too small. She gave them to our daughter."
3.0,This is biggger than I expected it to be.
3.0,"I got it for a gift for my 13 year old grandson. He loved it. I did not think the back was going to be plastic  for the price I had paid. The front was good, the back was not worst it!"
3.0,"Let me start by saying this is a beautiful sweater. Very nice material and beautifully stitched. The reason for the 3 stars is the color variation. Now mind you, the company has a comment in the description stating &#34;The actual color may be slightly different from the image caused by different brightness of various monitors and brightness. Please kindly understand about it and we cannot guarantee about the problems with color difference.&#34; The color I ordered was pink. When you look at the picture the color looks more of a deep fuchsia, what I received is a very very pale pink. The color is waaaaaayyy off!. If you don't mind receiving a color totally different than what you order you will be fine."
3.0,"Too baggy, not all large women want to hide their bodies. Just saying"
3.0,Not comfy or particularly nice. Average beanie.
3.0,"Thought it was strange that some are thinner material than other pairs in this pack. Otherwise , they work !"
3.0,"The item is pretty but rather stiff.  The color is my favorite color of brown and I'm a silver girl, which is what attracted me to the bracelet."
3.0,I'm 5'10 and this romper shows a little too much booty for my liking.  The design and color are very flattering although the material is very thin.
3.0,I bought this as a replacement for the one that goes with my Cayman S 987.1.  There's a slot on the passenger side floor for this.  It's too big to fit in it.  It rattles around if I put it anywhere else in the car.  I've moved it to the glove box of my Macan S instead.  Barely fits in there.  I'd rather have a longer sleeker porsche umbrella.  Little disappointed in this one.
3.0,These Bohemian earrings are fashionable and light weight but for me they didn't work.  My main issue is that two of the earrings require you to put the hook into a small hole and it is impossible.  Even when I try without the earrings on all I have managed to do is bend them.  I can't recommend this item because I feel only two pairs are usable.
3.0,"it was a little disappointing, to see the size I order and the way they fit were not a even comparison.  the pajamas are too small."
3.0,Uncomfortable. Would not stay up on my legs
3.0,These jeans are meant for people on the short side. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and they come up to my ankles. If you have long legs I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. They also aren‚Äôt as high waisted as the photo shows. The model must be pretty petite.
3.0,The Zipper broke off in a day
3.0,One ring is a size 6 and one is a size 8. Not sure why the actual rings are different sizes unless you want to wear them after the string breaks. They seem well made so we'll see.
3.0,The gems on the heart fall off after a while.  Otherwise pretty good.
3.0,"Looks cute on,but made cheap."
3.0,This is not a long sweater as shown in description. It is a waist length sweater not hip length
3.0,"I bought this charm for my daughter‚Äôs 13th birthday is super cute but when I received it it didn‚Äôt fit her charm bracelet I forced it to fit, the hole wasn‚Äôt a even circle. But my daughter  loved it. I loved it a month later the 13th fell off. We found where it fell and try to put it back on in a day later it fell off again. This charm is very cute but it won‚Äôt last very dainty. It‚Äôs not strong."
3.0,Great unicorn. Granddaughter loved it. The chain broke within a few hours. I will have to replace the chain.
3.0,Loved them but tarnish quick
3.0,"I feel like I have a pretty big head but these masks dwarf my face. Comfort is acceptable as is quality. But the size is a bit ridiculous. Seriously, they're huge."
3.0,"It is just me, but I bought three different pairs, two are going to my niece and I am keeping these."
3.0,Did not really hold up.
3.0,two socks had holes in them and one the stitching was not very good.
3.0,"This is a very cute top, but is much shorter than it appears.I'm 5'10&#34; and this is much too short to be considered a dress.  It's still a very cute top and looks good with shorts."
3.0,"Like the setting, color is not as stated in description."
3.0,It is nice&light. But I needed better than  it.
3.0,They were cute but one of the corner pieces wasn't attached properly. Probably an easy fix but I sent them back Quick refund
3.0,"I think I have a larger than average head and they fit fine.  My wife is on the smaller side and they don't fit her.  She also smells a strong plastic smell from them and I've been wearing one strap for nearly a week now without the smell going away.  Will try to air out the rest to see if it gets any better.  If your sensitive to the smell or are a small headed person, these wont work for you."
3.0,Eh it‚Äôs alright not worth the money
3.0,These earrings were placed  at the bottom of the box underneath heavy items! They were smashed but I managed to shape them back luckily!!!
3.0,Very pretty but it‚Äôs more of a choker then a necklace
3.0,"This backpack was okay. It's smaller than a standard school backpack but larger than a mini one. It's definitely better suited for a day at an amusement park rather than for school. The straps are thin and rough, and will not be comfortable for my Daughter's use for school. We'll use it, because it's what we have, but I was a little disappointed. The design is super cute though!"
3.0,"My fault, in the description I missed ""internal mesh brief"".<br /><br />Although, it would be so much more clear, if they put ""bathing suit"" in the ad.  Also, I now know to buy these at megavalue.com, the tag was still on it, two pairs for  ¬£11."
3.0,"I'm 5'9"" and thin - around 135#.  Based on the sizing,  ordered a large, and sent it back because it was too tight.  I like the design, but the fabric is very dense and doesn't have much stretch.  The fabric also had a very strong smell out of the package that may have washed out if I had kept it."
3.0,"Nice quality, too small<br />I am a xl, ordered a xxl, still too small."
3.0,"lol this jacket looks way cooler in the pictures. I think someone said ""people will notice right away that it's cheap"". Now ive never been one to give a shit about the quality of my clothes, but my god if theres one thing in my closet that looks cheap, its this jacket. And thats coming from a guy that rocks 50 fruit of loom white tees. Its very thin. I honestly cant even say much about this jacket seeing as i wore it like 5 times max. All i know is that i started to not like it. You know that feeling when you spend money on something and you wanna feel good about it, BECAUSE you spent money on it? Denying it sucks? Yeah. That. Get a northface you cheap mf."
3.0,Cute. I thought the material would be better. The cup size runs small
3.0,"hat is thin, flimsy"
3.0,This item is a gift. I will have to wait to discover the fit.  It was exactly as described in looks and came as a set .
3.0,I wish the shirt was made of a softer cotton.  I don't think that with time it will ever get softer.  Slightly disappointed.
3.0,"As others have said: Some may have issues with the size of the clips and causing a distraction while wearing. Like holding a finger vertically between your eyes- can't really see it but then again you can. I could pretend to not see it but in the long (I mean short) run, they just won't work for me. Returned.  However, if you can look past that (pardon the pun) these seem to be pretty ok."
3.0,"in theory they sound great. when u have small-ish hands, you have to pull the material around the finger rather tight to be able to touch your screen and it work."
3.0,"The hat fits well, is comfortable, and arrived on time.  However, the hat in the pictures had a drawstring chin strap that I was going for.  The hat I received did not have one."
3.0,Its cute I just thought it would be bigger.
3.0,The body of the shirts are very narrow and they are 100% cotton with very little stretch.
3.0,"Cute, comfortable, and true to size. However, wash on delicate or they come apart at seams."
3.0,You get 4 pair of the same design of leopard lace glove in different colors. They are soft and seemingly nice lace.  None of the colors worked for my skin tone. They are just ok and not what I was looking for so I returned them. Might work for someone else but not me.
3.0,"Cute design, cheap quality. Kind of expected due to low price point, but still a VERY cute necklace!"
3.0,The waist band isn‚Äôt ideal. It‚Äôs a bit loose on top and you have to use the drawstring to tighten which is uncomfortable for squatting. If they had a better elastic on the waistband then it would be perfect.
3.0,Not sure about fit yet.  It‚Äôs a gift.  Fabric was sure thinner than I expected.
3.0,Thought this item was burgundy like pic but beads are actually red.
3.0,"They seem to soften the night time glare a little, but there are too many kinds of headlights now that they don't seem to affect."
3.0,items matches the prices.
3.0,Not as comfortable as I like. Pockets are too small for my liking
3.0,"Because they were significantly smaller than displayed, the color is not as rich or noticeable."
3.0,Bought these for my pregnant daughter because her regular bras were rubbing her the wrong way. They fit and are comfortable but the pads move all over and when washed including both ending up on one side and it's a real pain to get them back where they belong.
3.0,"A little sheer, perfect for the beach"
3.0,The nose piece is completely off center and fits weird. It took MUCH longer to arrive than the anticipated arrival date.
3.0,So cute but run so small. Lining is separated from mitten which makes it hard to line up thumbs when putting on.
3.0,"These leggings are fine, but they are more see-through than I expected and it's hard to wear many things with them"
3.0,"The rings are beautiful! However, I got a size 7 (my normal size for 20 years) and it is waaaaay too small. The other 7s I bought fit like a glove. These I can't even wear on my finger but I'll wear them as a necklace because I really like them."
3.0,"The cut of this dress is very flattering, it is cute while still being fairly modest. Overall, it seems fairly well made, especially considering the very reasonable price. The fabric is not the highest of quality, however, it doesn't wrinkle and it washes pretty easily. Overall, it was worth the money I paid for it."
3.0,Not the best quality material. It worked for the occasion the it was purchased. I would not buy this item again.
3.0,"Good quality and the correct size. Only one plug that I had received  ended up being chipped though. They were loose in the box with a tiny bit of padding, not individually wrapped like some other pictures. Other than that I recommend this product."
3.0,The product is ok. I thought the words and crown had a sparkle to it.
3.0,Still broke out my metal senstive ears.
3.0,"Fit as expected, I ordered a smaller size intentionally to get more 'compression' but it's a weak material. Light compression at best.<br />I'm a large male at 6'2"" and 285lbs. I ordered large and it fits but it's thin and less effective than the last set of shirts I ordered."
3.0,It's kind of lazy - they just put ear holes at the seam on the sides instead of dedicated ear holes a little further back - so the scarf it constantly pulling on your ears - worse than a mask in that respect.
3.0,Nice watch but the clasp keeps opening and the set button backs out once in a while
3.0,Very cute. Just runs a size bigger!
3.0,"The pads are what I got it for. The padding itself, and the price are great. The shorts are a little itchy (yes I'm wearing underwear underneath). Size does not run as small as I thought it would. I thought they'd fit tighter like compression shorts. I wear medium basketball/tennis shorts and these padded protection shorts (in medium) fit only slightly tighter than regular, size medium, tennis shorts. The waistline also rides pretty high, not wild about that so I roll it once or twice"
3.0,Had to alter to make shape better .
3.0,"I like these rings other than the fact that they don't stretch out and can't be made any smaller very easily it's hard to make them smaller which was a disappointment because these rings are pretty big for my small fingers and the smaller rings feel scratchy on your fingers, it's wasn't a big deal since I didn't pay much for them"
3.0,I don't like the way it falls at the hips. It kind of sticks out and is not flattering. It probably works well for those with less hip.
3.0,Purchased for July 4th. Love the top. I wish you could buy bottoms separate as they were too big. Had to purchase different bottoms.
3.0,"I ordered 10 hats, received 6. When I checked the order status on Amazon said they hoped to receive them soon. Well when is ""soon?"" Tomorrow, March next year? I had to cancel the balance of the order and find another source. The hats I received were exactly as pictured and I'm satisfied with them, just wish they would have said when I placed the order that they couldn't fulfill the entire order."
3.0,Bow tie fell apart after 1 wear!
3.0,i love the look of the dress but the material of the dress is cheaply made
3.0,"Watch doesn't keep time well at all. You will have to reset it every few days. The bracelet fell apart within the first 2 weeks, but was repaired. Bezel completely came off after about a year. Giving 3 stars because there are a lot of negatives about this watch but overall, it looks so good on the wrist! The way the sun plays with the crystal, the applied letters on the piano black dial, crystal case back, cyclops lens and the 40mm case size - thumbs way up! It's cheaply made but looks great for a sub $100 watch. I received so many compliments on the watch and enjoyed the time I had with the watch. Great starter automatic watch."
3.0,"First off, I ended up returning this bag. The quality was bar none and very high. It was very comfortable and the color, stitching, and extras were very good.<br /><br />What made me return this bag ended up being the space in the pockets. The way the frame pushes the bag off of your back makes the main pocket space very tight. It is hard to load items properly because of this and made it hard to fit much more than a spotting scope and mini tripod. This bag would be perfect if it wasn‚Äôt for the frames awkwardness that suspends the load about two inches off of your back. Very comfortable but not very functional."
3.0,The snowflake was pretty but the chain it came with was VERY flimsy and had to be replaced.
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt true to size I ordered a 3x and fit like a large
3.0,"Nice design, but already noticing some slight fraying where the holes are."
3.0,"Just not for big boobs. Was holding out hope for a solution for a backless dress, but...just no. This didn‚Äôt work at all. Also, the bra seemed to start peeling off pretty quickly, so that certainly didn‚Äôt help."
3.0,I wear a size 14-16 and I am 5'10. This dress was to small and to short in the body. the waistline ran across my breasts.
3.0,"These don't have elastic, and for a little boy, that can be a problem sometimes. Cute, but not as practical as we thought."
3.0,Will be giving this to one of my kids. I got this and the ball on top yarn started coming out my cat had just attacked it and saw pile of yarn I touched hat and it was just falling out in clumps. I am just cutting the ball off the top. Hat is too small. It seems like it fit a small child not a adult.
3.0,"I would have rated this much higher if the product fit. I ordered a small, I am 5'7'' and a small or medium size, but the shirts came very stretchy and thinner than expected. If I didn't know what size I ordered, I would have thought I received a medium or large. They should be compression shirts, so I would order a couple of sizes down if you were to order this product."
3.0,"I highly recommend using the seller's measurements provided to determine your accurate size. I went with a small (my usual size) and it was about a size too big. With that said, I should have bought the x-small. For your reference I am 32B-26-36 and weigh 105 pounds.<br /><br />As for the fabric, it was nice and comfortable and doesn't feel cheap. It looks nice on as well. It was just my fault for not going with my instinct and getting the size x-small."
3.0,These skirts are beautiful. Very brilliant colors and nice material. But I‚Äôm very disappointed they run very small. I wear a L-XL normally but XL dosen‚Äôt fit. Please make bigger.
3.0,Way smaller than expected. I can not wear it.
3.0,Velcro issue with someone with small head size like me.
3.0,"Worth the price, but I could definitely see them stretching out overtime."
3.0,Cute necklace but poor quality! The beds all fell off!!
3.0,"Why is the shirt so short??? The pants have really long legs and the shirt is basically a crop top. Idk, it's weird."
3.0,comfortable but too narrow. looks funny.
3.0,"I like the concept, but the quality is poor.  The fabric around the zipper is easily frayed."
3.0,"I wanted to love, but the top part ran large on me. Did not provide any support, had to return."
3.0,I like the material of the shirt. But order a size up because they run small.<br />Also one of the shirts had a hole in it when I took it out of the package
3.0,The lock on the chain came faulty and it kept dropping off.
3.0,"I found that they are pretty and soft,  but hard to type with. Not really surprising because of the  hard gloved finger tips.  As gloves they fit well, have kept my hands warm, and feel great, but as texting gloves, not that great."
3.0,"My daughter loves the prints and feel, I reccomend sizing up 2."
3.0,so they would work for summer...they feel like tencel to me.  They washed and dried well.  But they do not look like pants for boys....they are tailored more for a girl.  I ordered these for my 2 year old grandson and I ordered a 2T.  They were a bit long and frankly just too flowy and not fitted enough to look like boys jeans.  These are more like pants than jeans.
3.0,Followed manufacturers size chart and jacket was to small (should have known because I‚Äôve never been a med-size.) I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 145 lbs with 38 bust. Returned for a large because I do like the jacket.  Large Fits better but arms are snug with just a t shirt!  Not sure I‚Äôm keeping this one yet! Gave 3 stars for the quality of the jacket. Would have given 5 except for the nuisance of sizing issue and tight sleeves.
3.0,"I loved the color n the dress looks very nice on. My problem is it is so thin, afraid material will not last a couple washings. Won‚Äôt purchase another."
3.0,I had one break when my son was out playing.  My husband was able to fix it.  No other one has done that yet (we have 4) but I am kind of waiting for it to happen.  They should be able to handle kids playing.
3.0,"Watch looks good, however the Watch band clasp doesn't stay closed, cant be fixed and needs to be replaced. I will contact the vendor to see about a return or exchange."
3.0,I think the sizing of the rings is a little off as in a little larger than the sizing provided in the description. None of the rings were snug enough that I can wear them without fear of them coming off if I'm cool/cold. They are as pictured in the description (design and color). The underside of the elephant ring is not smooth and feels scratchy to the touch/on my finger.
3.0,Feel good yet on day 2 the stiching\threads holding them together is already falling apart. Sadly not real sure how long they are going to last. Potential to be good slippers with a little better materials used sowing them together.
3.0,"It was returned, nothing bad, it was a bit too large and a little plan."
3.0,"Not as smooth or silky as I had hoped. I was expecting a more satin like feel, similar to other nightwear of the same material. It also has a less roomy and more tailored sizing than the illustration seemed to show. I'll probably just pass it on to someone else as a gift. It is pretty enough and just because it wasn't what I was hoping for, it is still ok for the price and not worth the bother of returning if I can find someone it will fit and who will like it."
3.0,Here you're buying a brand name. Nothing too special about a pair of dog earrings. My niece wanted them but I would not have purchased for myself.
3.0,nice material but was sent back
3.0,Looks just like the picture. It runs a little small the Arms are tight. Nice quality
3.0,Sent back..cheap looking
3.0,"This was massive on me in normally a size 4, b cup. My mother is an xl and a dd cup and it fit her perfect. It was very lovely but I was sad I couldn't wear it"
3.0,The fit is very small. I suggest going up 2 sizes
3.0,This product works as expected but cheap.
3.0,Pretty necklace but I ordered it in gold and it came in silver. Gave it to my daughter-in-law and she liked it
3.0,The shirt is cute. A little disappointed in the length. Seems really short for a tshirt
3.0,"very small, but pretty"
3.0,"Cute. When I first got it I thought the straps were a little too stiff, but after some use with some wieght inside, they seem a little better. I love that its wipe off cleanable."
3.0,"So, I was using this on a child-sized head not an adult one.  And said child has short hair.  But this wig barely covered.  Felt like it was sitting on top of the kid's head like a hairpiece. Can't imagine it would fit on an adult head."
3.0,"I wear a US 8. I purchased a 10 and could not even pull it on. It was TINY! Otherwise, quality appears fine."
3.0,Nice color but I didn't realize you have to tie the blue tie. I thought it came tied already so we were disappointed that no one knows how to tie one
3.0,"Unfortunately, I ordered the grey. I got two different shades. One grey and the other looks kind of pink. Very disappointed ."
3.0,Comfortable I love the suedes elbow patches.<br />Being a textile designer I am very critical in print design and production.  The plaid print on the garment is not professional quality.  That being said it doesn‚Äôt bother most people and I always receive compliments on the shirt.
3.0,Ankle strap was too big.
3.0,The strap that goes over the top of the foot is to tight.  The sandals tend to slip off my feet while I climb stairs.  I would not buy these again.
3.0,They are nice and bright. Very easy to read.
3.0,Super cute but clasps and letter seem very cheap and easy to break
3.0,I loved the design and color. I ordered xlarge and got a large and was a little too tight. Ended up returning
3.0,"Ok quality, crappy handle"
3.0,THEY ARE SMALLER .<br />ORDER A SIZE BIGGER.
3.0,Product fits large. Size down one size.
3.0,Very bright orange. I thought looking at the picture it would be more of a dark fall or rust orange but it's more of a bright Harley Davidson orange. I doubt I will ware it.
3.0,I'm 5'1 and ordered a MD in mens
3.0,"These fit okay, but the waist is a little big. That might be because I've been losing weight, so I'm not too concerned with it. However, for ""warm, fleece lined"" leggings, these are a disappointment. They're pretty thin, and not much warmer than leggings with no lining. If you're looking for a nice, warm legging, these aren't it."
3.0,Ok. Did what supposed to but didn't hold enough to keep my sons feet from slipping out with every step he took
3.0,The pants are light and feel great. I owned the regularly thickness elite sports in an A4 and I liked it quite a bit. I bought the same size in the lightweight and it is way too tight in the shoulders. I can‚Äôt move at all in it. I missed my window to return it which is my own fault for forgetting about it. I still wear the pants now however and I like them so far.
3.0,"Cute product. Helped keep the sweat out my eyes, got nice compliments. Took a long time to arrive though."
3.0,"The shoes are okay look-wise. They look better when they are tied up all the way. I might be being too nit picky but one shoe lace was longer than the other. That bothered me about it a little, but thats not too major. I like my shoes to be comfortable, but these are not comfortable at all. They do not pinch from any side, but I had to put in my shoe inserts in order to wear these. If i wear without my inserts, my heels start to hurt alot. As I mentioned before, they are not the shoes where you can wear them and they are super comfortable and can wear for hours. If i wear them with inserts I can wear them for longer but not without the inserts. Also if you are trying to wear the show by closing all the way through, there are hooks after the few holes to thread the laces through. Unless the shoe laces are tightened, the laces keep on getting out of the hooks. That is very inconvenient because everytime I take the shoes off and wear them again I have to thread the laces in all the way through. I wish the heel was also just a tad bit longer to provide a little support. I have been wearing them for about 2 hours without too much walking and my feet are starting to hurt. If you are solely going on the basis of they look nice these shoes would be great. But if you are planning on walking too much in these, then not so great. The good thing about them is they don't feel like you are wearing rain boots while walking. Rain boots feel super stiff when you are walking in them and these are nothing like those. (referencing to  rain boots because some shoes are like rain boots and its painful to walk with them). The only thing that bothered me about these is the shoe does not provide as much comfort as i would like it to. If you buy the inserts from somewhere for the feet then these shoes are good.<br /><br />I recieved this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review"
3.0,"The shirt is cute. It held up after the wash and the image is still there. The skirt was cute, but not quite as pictured. You really needed to fluff it out. It also did not survive the wash. I would suggest putting it a garment bag on top of washing it on delicate."
3.0,This clutch was cute but it was not my style. Didn't like the color to work with a blush pink dress.
3.0,"The earrings are very pretty. However, the back piece slips out easily and does not stay in. It is too loose."
3.0,Too small. And it is pink not Red.
3.0,Pros:<br />Comfortable<br />Keep the shirt tucked in<br />Easy to Wear<br /><br />Cons:<br />The clip on one of the belt will not work stay tight. It unbuckles itself. So I had to buy a new pair.
3.0,I got this gift for my husband since hes hard to shop for. He says he likes it but he also said he thinks its for a girl.
3.0,"Bracelet looks nice, but the clasp sticks. Maybe in time it will loosen up."
3.0,Material was not what I expected. Hate the material.
3.0,"Super cute boots!  My daughter loved them, but as with most kids, she plays hard in them and the decorative pieces came off.  Not made well for kids boots.  It's been less than six weeks and the only thing left is the bow, barely hanging on."
3.0,Bought a 3X and its not as big as a traditional American 3x..its more like an XL
3.0,"I bought this because I'm an Earth science teacher and teach the Solar system. My first degree is in geology.  So, I thought the stones for each planet represented a certain stone and that this would perfect.  No information on it and the stones may not be authentic.  Good price but a bit disappointed"
3.0,"These are decent gloves for the price, although the texting fingers don‚Äôt work well at all. They could be warmer too, but still will work for Fall. I washed them and they washed up nicely."
3.0,"After one wear, the stitching is already coming apart in the crotch. Very disappointing."
3.0,the bag was synthetic and didn't look like leather. It was not the right size.
3.0,"Bottom of inside of shoe is hard, kinda slippery"
3.0,I really want to love these earrings. Didn‚Äôt return them because I really wanted them to grow on me but after 2 attempts I don‚Äôt want to try them on again. It is a project to take them off. Sorry!
3.0,It's pretty but much smaller than I expected from the picture and the description.
3.0,The quality isn't as nice as I would have liked but I'll wear it. I think it will look nice from afar so I don't mind the imperfections as much but it's really cheap. You get what you pay for in this case. I don't even want to wear the earrings since you can see all of the glue but I think the necklace is less noticeable since it is somewhat framed by your clothes...
3.0,Color was not represented accurately online. I bought this for a costume and this was far off the color I had expected. I took off one star for color and one for price. It was a bit more than I wanted to spend but needed it to match my costume. It was large enough to be comfortable and didn‚Äôt hurt behind my ears. It held up nice in the wash. I would buy this again for function but not color.
3.0,To be honest this was not my favorite top. It remindes me of something you would get on Shein. Fine for going to a bar or tailgate but that's about it.
3.0,"I've owned these for about 3-4 months now. I love the fit, simple style, and some of the quality. I bought 2 pair and the pocket on one of the shorts now has a hole after a month or 2. The decorative stripes are peeling after about 3 months. Shorts still serve their purpose for the most part so I'm giving them 3 stars. I'm usually a medium/large, I wanted a size up from normal so I got the ""3XL"" based on the size chart."
3.0,Average. .
3.0,"Just got it and when I open the box, the rubber foot starts to come out. Poorly made... and if its poorly made its made in.... You know (Poor Refurbish of Ch....). Just suck it upüò© Loctite to the rescue!!!! I hope it will work as it claims...will never know..."
3.0,"Product was of  good quality. I measured carefully, but they would not fit well over my glasses?"
3.0,"The top was too small and dug into my sides, the bottoms fit but they sure are very warm, good and bad side to that seeing as they are shorts."
3.0,This wasn‚Äôt great quality. Kinda plasticky feeling.
3.0,They were a perfect fit as far as tightness goes... I'm 5'6&#34; and 154 pounds and they're about four inches above my ankles which I'm not a fan of but they're still super cute and comfortable!
3.0,Tight for adult with large hands
3.0,"It's pretty, but the bodice was weird and the dress fit *quite* small for the size.  This was a 14 that I feel fit like a 10. The crossover &#34;mummy wrap&#34; added weight to my upper body.  The fabric is not what I would consider formal; it's a thin kind of polyester.  The beadwork was very pretty across the straps, though, and for a body with a longer torso (I'm 5'0&#34; and very short waisted) this dress would probably be gorgeous."
3.0,"I am disappointed in this bird beak mast.  While it is amusing, it is not protective as a mask."
3.0,Good product but hard to loosen ball
3.0,"I like the Fanny Pack, especially that it is made of good quality leather. I could use a little bigger one. The main complaint I have is that it is much too big around for me, and I am not a really small person. I cannot make it any smaller. I believe I read a review with this same complaint before I bought the Fanny Pack."
3.0,"Runs very small and shrinks even more after washing.  Decent quality, but fits snug.  Recommend ordering up 2 sizes if you want it to fit comfortably."
3.0,"Looks nice but it's a little tight in the back and shoulders. If I didn't have to wear a blouse to work/move a lot in, it would be okay.  Also, there's no way this material breathes.<br />It fills my work aesthetic requirements, but performance not so much."
3.0,"These tank tops are fine, but they do NOT have a bra insert. I thought they would still be just fine, but if you want a really tight fit, you definitely need to order a size smaller."
3.0,"Nice looking and decent quality but way too long!  Unfortunately due to the long length, you cannot see the Honda print when wearing especially if you have to wear a jacket or sweatshirt.  Im going to attempt to hem from the top to make a little shorter to see print.  Hopefully that works."
3.0,Looks nice. A little small for my taste
3.0,"In all honesty I am a size large and I had to order a 2xl to get it big enough to fit me without feeling constricting. I don‚Äôt like the material. It‚Äôs comfortable, but it‚Äôs not like a cotton ish , It‚Äôs kinda shiny much more polyester than I would prefer"
3.0,Me gustaron los colores pero el material un poco delgado
3.0,Ajustan muy bien aunque no tienen suficiente levante. Son muy c√≥modos
3.0,VERY STRETCHY. DO NOT BUY A SIZE UP. Lower quality than I expected but still good enough to wear. The white is a little see through.
3.0,I am a size 2(American Eagle size) in shorts and a small wouldn't even button on me. I would definitely go one size up. I am returning. Quality on the other hand was GREAT! I really hate it didn't fit.
3.0,XL was not XL
3.0,"Somewhat cheap, but priced accordingly."
3.0,I normally wear a size 8 but ordered a 9 and i was shocked at how tight these boots were. Their beautiful but i wish i ordered a size 10. I'd recommend ordering 2 sizes up.
3.0,The M I bought is bigger than the usual L.
3.0,"The quality of the cosplay is good for what you pay. My only problem is the condition the cosplay came in. Some of the stars came with scratches and parts of the gold were chipped off, showing the black plastic. One of the gloves had a small hole. Both a leg warmer and glove had a small stain that looked like dirt. Maybe I just got unlucky, but this was pretty disappointing."
3.0,Cute and cheap and came on time. These won‚Äôt hold up forever.  They are pretty thing but luckily they were a good price.
3.0,Cute but a lot smaller then pictured. I really hopped they would be as big as they appeared in the pic showen . Each earring is just slightly larger then a quarter.
3.0,Weird material and very see though
3.0,Love the ability to fold them for travel & they come with a great bag to keep them in. Price is very good for this product which is good for light to medium use.<br />Do not like the finished height when assembled.  I am 5ft tall & my hands were up near my shoulders holding the handle part.  I ended up not using them because of this.
3.0,"This Moyabo casual dress is much prettier in the pictures than it is in real life. One problem is that the color of the skirt background is not as black as it is in the pictures. It actually looks like a weird purple-gray. In addition, this dress style is obviously much more flattering to a slim person than an average-sized person.<br /><br />I got this for my daughter, a young lady standing 5‚Äô9‚Äù and weighing 160-175 pounds. She‚Äôs a bit of a pear with a bit of a tummy and a small (A-B) bust. The high waist and the shorter full skirt just didn‚Äôt really look as nice on her as I wish it had.<br /><br />I think this dress would be more flattering if it were longer and the waist perhaps a bit lower. The waist might be okay where it is if the skirt were fuller and lengthened. That said, this dress would be flattering to a slim person with a smaller waist.<br /><br />My daughter likes this dress, even thought it‚Äôs not flattering, because it‚Äôs comfy and light. Overall, I wish the colors on the dress matched the listing. That would help a great deal.<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

3.0,Fit nice but material is very thin.
3.0,It's cute and does the job well but does run a tad small
3.0,"Pretty band, but  colors aren‚Äôt as vibrant as pictured.  Very skiff. Not as soft like regular leather."
3.0,"It was cool, hard to see and breath out of it. My self and 15 year old daughter didnt care for it after 20 minutes of wearing the mask. Heats your face up from trying to breath threw it and really hard to see especially if you go out in it."
3.0,The jacket was nice but the arms were about 4 inches short.
3.0,Way too small otherwise looks just like the picture
3.0,Nice but very large. Can not wear
3.0,Material is very poor quality. Had to return. Return process was easy that's why I'm giving 3 stars.
3.0,I like the skort but had to exchange for smaller size so still haven‚Äôt actually been able to wear.
3.0,"I mean.. I probably should have paid better attention, but wow are the gems small. I got this to go in my Medusa and the length was too short, and the gemstones were smaller than expected. My bad though."
3.0,"THIS ANKLET IS SOOO PRETTY! I have an obsession with anklets and this anklet so far is my favorite. Some of the reviewers said that theirs broke off so I took one star off because the lock on the anklet does not seem very sturdy. I however had to give that one star back because it's just too pretty. I reinforced the lock with a skin tone string so that if the lock ever breaks off, i have a back up lock. I have a big ankle and I was surprised that this dainty pretty little thing fit my ankle. Just buy it you guys. And reinforce the lock with a string so you don't have to worry about losing it.<br /><br />Sadly enough after 6 months of withstanding abuse it broke off even with the string reinforcement. It is still very pretty but it's not the strongest."
3.0,Very nice but it was super short and was to small
3.0,just ok. runs a little large
3.0,"Like, but oversized - ordered small and they are too big"
3.0,It's really slouchy so in the blue stripe color it almost looks like an old-timey sleeping cap.  It's soft and lightweight so it works well for summer and is nice enough for the price.
3.0,"It was definitely cute! Just slightly see through and runs a little small. I got a tutu to wear over it thank goodness because it gave me major camel toe as well. The headband I am wearing in the picture  is not the headband it came with. Overall I did like it, but maybe not the best quality."
3.0,"Cute design, but straps do not adjust so mask slips down fall down on small child."
3.0,A beautiful product worth the price
3.0,Not as good as the older version
3.0,"The fit of the sunglasses is exactly what I was looking for. I did not receive a case or a cleaning cloth. The sunglasses were in plastic inside a box. Both sunglasses, one hinge is tight while the other is loose. Tried to tighten but won‚Äôt work. I doubt these will last. 3 stars for fit."
3.0,"The mat is durable but the smell is awful. It's like smelling fresh petroleum...like it's built into the mat. I cannot have indoors and have tried everything, including leaving in sun to bake out scent. Unfortunately, the mat is outdoor only, unless you like the fragrance of a machine shop indoors."
3.0,Fit a little tight came with a lot of fuzz on it.
3.0,These are well constructed and look like they'll last long but they are HUGE my daughter is approaching a size nine toddler and they fit about two sizes bigger
3.0,"These are so cool ..but I returned them because I wanted gold, which is shown in the picture, but I received silver ones."
3.0,"Review update: I have to increase my rating and review based on the actions of this company's customer service. Out of nowhere I received a package containing 2 bibs. Also I closed was a short personal note. That is customer support above and beyond the norm. Perhaps my first snap was defective... In any case I plan to give them the benefit of the doubt and I also want  to say thank you to their customer support person.<br /><br />What a disappointment. The snap on the strap that goes around your neck is very flimsy. It broke the second day I used it. Utilizing a snap versus velcro means that no adjustment is possible. The material is very thin, which is okay but it is not water resistant in any way. It does have a crumb catcher. I was going to return it but decided fixing it with velcro would be just as easy. I would not recommend this product nor would I buy again."
3.0,"I'm 4'11"" and curvy so it is extremely long but nothing a little alterations can't fix. Love the print. Super cute!"
3.0,Just okay.  Not crazy about the texture of the fabric
3.0,Really really cute BUT..doesn't fit my wrist and slides right off
3.0,"For 16$ I wasn't expecting much. The mask part is really large, but well painted and scary. I took the wig part off and I'm going to make the mask solid with the use of some old mask making techniques. It needs work. That's for sure."
3.0,My child prefers the nylon looking masks from Costco with bright colors
3.0,Great product. It became a lifesaver when I traveled to the Bahamas. I wish the zip pouches were bigger to accommodate larger portable batteries though.
3.0,"Felt like it ran small, like the cups are too close together. I'm typically a 32C-34B and for a strapless I went small with the ribcage measurement. I couldn't even cram my girls in this thing and close it. Pretty though. Order up."
3.0,"Love the fit and the look. However, the first time I wore it I landed about 10 snags. It's ruined. Very loosely woven, so it's not an all day sweater. Dinner out, movies... short term wear. I am going to attempt to repair it. Wish me luck!"
3.0,"A little more clear than I was expecting, but still looks pretty nice"
3.0,"After reading the reviews, and everyone saying it ran small, I decided to order a medium (I am usually a small in most clothes)....definitely regret it. The medium was way too baggy and loose. I am 5'2&#34;, 115 lbs; and should of ordered the small. The print looks exactly as pictured and the material is light. You can adjust the X straps in the back, but it still leaves gaps near the side boob. The bottom have a waist tie, which i tried tying as tight as i could, but the shorts still looked big. Definitely have to return."
3.0,It we ok just a little big
3.0,I wanted a short that was tighter at the knees. I think that is more slimming. These do not hug the knees at all so I returned them.  My legs are not thin more average so  i thought they would work since the model has skinny legs. I returned them but  the quality was nice.
3.0,I just recieved this in pink and the color looks nothing like the photo.  It's more pepto bismol than soft ballet pink.  Very disappointed.  Returning.
3.0,"Fabric was quite thin and I didn't like where the top of the peplum started. It was too low and unflattering on me. Maybe someone with a longer torso and more height would like it better. I am 5'2&#34; and 115 lbs and the small was the correct size for me, but returning."
3.0,"The fit was fine but the white is transparent enough that not only can you see my bra line, but my tattoos as well. I'll likely reorder in a darker color."
3.0,I knew it'd be thin lacy material and it got the job done for what I needed it for. I gave it to my little sister and she now enjoys it for dress up! So I am pleased with the durability of this seemingly fragile item.
3.0,The bars are much thicker than a standard belly ring. Actually hurt to the point I had to remove it and put my old one back it. Would be fine if you're used to a thicker bar.
3.0,"Had these shoes for a couple months and the heals ripped off the shoe. They're cheap so that is to be expected. If you want shoes that will last a long time, buy something else. If you just want shoes that are cheap and you're in between nice pairs of shoes, these will do the trick until you can get a pair that will last longer. Other than the fact they broke, they were comfortable."
3.0,A tad small. My daughter is a small girl and it barely fit around her. But it looks like it did in the pictures.
3.0,I like the way they look. But sag in the behind.
3.0,"The dress is very, very thin. If definitely feels cheap and shows every lump and bump. The top is also cut very weird around the neckline. It's too wide across the shoulders so I know I'll have to fight with my bra straps to keep them far enough out on my shoulders to be hidden by the dress. Also, the waistline is cut weird so it bunches kind of odd at the small of my back. On the bright side, it is pretty modest with the skirt falling almost to my knees and the top not showing a ton of cleavage. It's cute enough to wear to work once in a while and the colors are beautiful. I probably wouldn't order it again but I also don't hate it so I gave it three stars."
3.0,"These suspenders are ok. They fit, though they were smaller than I expected. My son is 3 and I was on the fence about whether to get the smaller ones or not, based on his age and size (he's small for his age). I ended up getting the larger ones with a longer suggested age range and I'm glad I did! The quality is so-so. They work for the most part. But my 3 year old managed to pull the clips off a couple of times now. I don't want to bother with a return so I just put them back together which isn't too difficult, just mildly annoying."
3.0,"I like this dress for a simple outfit. The lace across the neck line looks pretty jacked though so I‚Äôll probably have to iron it down. It‚Äôs also shapeless and long on me and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 so I have to hem it too. I‚Äôm keeping it so I can fix it up, but it probably wouldn‚Äôt look bad on a different body type."
3.0,"Nice shirt, it just runs really small. which is crazy because if you follow the size chart it seems to run big. Go by your regular sizing not the chart."
3.0,Can't get the clasp to open.
3.0,"They are ok, will be mixing them up with my own straps"
3.0,"Very pretty for the price paid. It‚Äôs dainty and sparkly, plus, they sent a free gift of an additional chain which was nice."
3.0,"Wow, this piece is absolutely gorgeous but here's why I ended up returning it.<br /><br />PROS: The length, the weight, the quality, the design, distribution and placement of the charms are perfect!<br /><br />CONS: What's up with ""gold-tone plated metal""? What exactly does that even mean? There are so many excellent plating options that offer a look very similar to real gold, but the chain on this piece looks like oxidized brass. I really wanted to love this necklace but for the $230 price tag, the gold plating should be really good quality.<br /><br />Come on, Swarovski! You can do better than gold-tone plated metal."
3.0,Fun interchangeable watches for snap bracelets. But batteries don't last. Replace batteries and it still won't run. Some of the snap backs come off. Not too good. But what do you expect for this price?
3.0,"This dress looks better in the picture.  The material is not the same and it's just plain.  I purchased a body chain to wear with this to dress it up a little.  The dress material is thin, you can see through it so make sure you are comfortable with that before purchasing.  I wish it looked a little more like the picture but I will make it work."
3.0,"Battery life is decent, quality of the sound is good. Only downfall is the beanie stretches and loses shape, so now the ear pieces get moved around. Ultimately loses quality of material, and uncomfortable fit."
3.0,"Love the charm, but the necklace itself is cheap."
3.0,They are cute but way too tight. Couldn't wear them
3.0,Oddly made. Bigger bottom than top.
3.0,I ordered 3 pairs and 2 of them didn't fit
3.0,"I overall extremely liked these leggings, BIG bonus for me was the pockets. And they are so light that I would forget I put my phone in there, and end up searching for it. Only con was I got the size XL and while a bit tight on my thighs, was huge around my waist. I am 7 months PP and still have a saggy tummy, so I can‚Äôt imagine how much space other people must have. I can just roll them and they are fine, but if you have a smaller waist and bigger thighs, these may not work for you."
3.0,It runs too long for S/M size. I am hoping it shrink after washing.
3.0,Really cute and delicate bracelet.  Holds up well.  My only problem with it is that the clasp is very hard to get done.  I have to get help putting the bracelet on and then I struggle to get it back off.
3.0,"Very cute pattern but cheap material and horrible seamstress work. The polka dots do not line up. Also, the dress has an irregular hemline. The price should be $10 or less."
3.0,"fast delivery- easily scratched and scuffed quickly,"
3.0,"The price tells you that this is not an expensive watch, but it is an attractive one. As for quality, it's probably not competing with the more expensive watches either. However, after weeks of use, I can affirm that it has worked without fail,  except that it's been extremely hard to keep the band clasped. I haven't figured out a solution to that problem yet, but maybe you can."
3.0,Pendant seems well made but when separated the bottoms are rather sharp which is a concern for kids.  The chain is pretty useless though.  Broke within an hour of my daughter wearing it.  Price should be cheaper since you'd have to basically throw the chain away and buy a stronger one if you really intend on wearing it.
3.0,It is a little bigger than my old one so I have not used it.
3.0,Metal around stones turned colors
3.0,"I like the clear frame & shape, however it‚Äôs not a transition lens at all. It gets pale pale grey.. not like description on the lens"
3.0,Inexpensive. Good enough for the price but pretty cheap quality.
3.0,"The earrings are as described and as pictured. Keep in mind that the picture with the model is a close-up--look at it just in comparison with the size of the ear. The silver looks nice, but yes, the lapis is really as dull in real life as it is in the photo. It really just looks like painted on blue, to be honest.<br /><br />All in all, though, I'm happy with the purchase."
3.0,"Pretty dress. Very basic and comfortable, just not what I was looking for."
3.0,Need to be ironed.  Excellent fit and look.
3.0,"This is pretty but this lady must be 5ft tall.  I am 5'7&#34; and this shawl did not fit me like this.  It is almost to the ground on her and it only came to my knees plus I had to bend my elbows to stretch out the wings because they were too short.  Also there is no loop to put on your finger in like on my other cape, you have to hold it. It fit my granddaughter like the picture and she is 5ft/100 pounds."
3.0,Very fragile. Broke very easily.
3.0,Style was great but pmts a bit thin and lightweight.
3.0,"Didn't really like the material, it wasn't sweatshirt like"
3.0,not shoes what is up with that
3.0,"I'm normally an XL/ 14-16 and measure about 44 in the bust so I went by the measurements given- go a size up if you are American.<br />This dress is beautiful, but it doesn't fit.  I took pictures when I first got the dress but due to a new job I've been on the go and haven't been able to find the pictures.  I did want to give and honest review though.  The bottom portion of this dress fits great but the bust does not.  It might measure across as 44 inches but it does not fit a 44 bust.  I couldn't even zip up the back, it was embarrassing. The arms are tight as well, I could not bend them.  The material is great quality!  I was shockingly surprised but it just didn't fit my chest at all.<br />If I find the pictures I'll be glad to post them."
3.0,Comfortable underfoot.. Often felt as if tipping forward
3.0,I wish that comes on petite sizes is was way to long and I had to pay to get it heim
3.0,Cute but runs too big
3.0,"The material was nice! I wanted to love it, but in the XL, it was bulky and not flattering. The Olive color was very nice."
3.0,Stinks and I can't seem to get it out or I'd give 5 stars.
3.0,Twists and doesn't keep open.
3.0,"This is a gorgeous ring, no doubt. The color of the peridot is beautiful. It does fit true to size and is worth the advertised price.<br />However....the reason for the 3 star is due to the size and the diamond accents. The description says it has diamond accents. I only found one micro diamond. It's barely visible to the naked eye. I know due to the cost it wouldn't be much, but they should just omit &#34;diamond accents&#34; from the description.<br />My next issue is the size. This is a tiny, dainty ring. I looks bigger in pictures, even my own picture for this review. Now if you like small rings then buy this, you'll love it. But me personally I like my rings a bit bigger.<br />So overall this is beautiful and priced good, but petite in size and lacks the accents."
3.0,"I love the print but the fit is not flattering.  It looks cute in the picture but it is very cheaply made. It runs true to size and stretchy material. I didn‚Äôt overall like the dress, just not quite my style."
3.0,The legs are a bit short. I don't have terribly long legs and these are more capris length on me. Other than that they are great. Color stays. Squat proof and great control top.
3.0,"Not crazy about the fabric.  I bought Large and it clings, not loose like shown.  Normally a Large is loose on me."
3.0,"The look is the same as the picture. However, the length was extremely long!"
3.0,This are very thick and run a bit big.  I returned them because the waist and crotch did not fit properly.  I will try again in XS.
3.0,"I had to return this product, though I was very excited about it after reading all the reviews. For reference, I am 5 feet tall with a short torso, and I am really overweight now at about 170 pounds. I am in the process of trying to get back down to my normal weight of 130 since my daughter is now a toddler, and I find that wearing shape wear makes me feel more confident in my daily life, as well as I find it supports my back while I do my workouts at the gym. I usually buy the Spanx Assets brand from Target, but even with rotating 4 pairs and hand washing so I can wear them every day, I find myself replacing the Spanx high waisted mid thigh shapers every 6 weeks (approximately). The material is thin, and it shreds very easily. So, since those are $23, and the one I ordered from the Spanx website didn't last much longer, I decided to try this brand. The material of the shaper was very thick, and felt almost like velvet. I would have loved to keep this as it felt great on and seemed to work, but it only came half way up my back, whereas I am used to all of my shapers coming up high enough that I can tuck them under my bra line so they don't budge. It was surprising that it was so short, because I did purchase a large, and I have a VERY short torso."
3.0,I really like the sweater and get a lot of compliments but it is already starting to pill after only 2 washing's.  So that is disappointing.
3.0,Wore it once and the arrow fell off the chain. Looks pretty but not impressed with durability
3.0,Dress fits well but the sleep a little bit too big for me
3.0,Didn‚Äôt know what it was mesh  on the backside
3.0,Color was off .. more pink than expected. Shorts fit good top was not as expected and way not as flowy as picture shows.
3.0,I hope they stretch!
3.0,The fir was smaller than expected
3.0,"This bra is by no means no bounce. It does minimize the bounce however it doesn't stop it. It does work for lower impact and I can run in it, but I there is movement. I have the Glamorize double layer bra and that one works better for running. I might try this one when I do yoga or body weight and see if that is a better exercise for it."
3.0,"I thought I figured it all out. I read all the reviews. I figured that I'm maybe a bit bigger than some of the descriptions so the large would fit fine. I should have realized that nearly everyone writes about themselves in a flattering light. I'm no different, so take this with a grain of salt.<br />I'm 6'2&#34; 200lbs. Broad shoulders and arms, and pretty doughy everywhere else. The Large is too big. Not GIGANTIC, but I definitely would like it a lot more fitted. In particular, the width of the arms where they attach to the torso are very oversized. 2 feet in circumference, no exaggeration. Sleeve length is fine. Elastic cuffs keep them from dropping too much. Bottom hem hits 2-3 inches below my belt.<br />Thankfully, awesome Amazon provided me with a refund. I might try the Medium. MIGHT. But I feel like I'll need the torso of a Medium and the sleeves from a Small."
3.0,Lenses are low quality
3.0,"Cute dress but had to return due to being too small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 140 and the medium was way too tight."
3.0,Love WrightSocks--but these crawl down my heels and I'm always having to take off my shoes and pull them up.  Won't buy these shorties again.
3.0,Super cute but runs really small. I figured I‚Äôd need a lg but bought xl after reading reviews. Gave it to my sister in law who usually wears a small or medium! Bought myself a 2xl and it fits great.
3.0,"Cute design, soft cotton but too short body and too long sleeves."
3.0,"Its not small but it fits nothing like the picture suggests. My son is very thin And it fits like leggings, very tight to the skin.  It's large enough but it doesn't have a harem crotch, again like the picture suggest. I was being nice by giving it 3 stars."
3.0,"3 stars because arrived cracked; was not sent in box. Otherwise is a very beautiful piece. Flowers were attached well and stayed in place, just a chunk of glass had broken off. From the pictures I thought the chain style was an odd choice but actually looked good in person!"
3.0,"It is really cute, but the hands/gloves were off centered and it really bothered me. Also runs a little small"
3.0,"Cute dress, just v-e-r-y small. Perhaps jr? I bought a Large...which is what I'd typically wear...it fit like a second skin...um, needless to say...it went back!"
3.0,"I was pleased with the quality of the dress. The pictures on Amazon were very accurate. However, the sizing is very &#34;off.&#34; I went by the size chart which indicated that a Large would give me about an inchto an inch and a half of wiggle room everywhere. I typically wear a Medium or 8/10 in US sizes.  The dress was roomy in the waist and hips. But it was extremely small in the bust and shoulders. I do have a very large bust (32 GG) but a small rib cage and small shoulders.  Going by the size chart measurements it should have easily fit, but it was TIGHT in the shoulders and did not even come close to coming together over my bust.  I'm short (5'2&#34;), and the dress skimmed the ground even when wearing 3 1/2&#34; heels. I ended up returning it.  I'm debating ordering a larger size, but the XL isn't prime shipping/free returns like the Large. If the XL still ends up fitting weird, I don't want to have to pay to ship it back."
3.0,Mounts are very sturdy and lights are bright for how small and compact they are but the battery life doesn‚Äôt last nearly as long as advertised. Brightest setting lasts about an hour.
3.0,too large and had to return :(.
3.0,"Thought they were sterling, but discolored one time when i wore them in the shower."
3.0,"I think this hat is good quality and material, especially for the price. My only complaint is that the clasp for the strap always catches on my long hair when I take off my hat making it uncomfortable as I have to detangle my hair from it. This happens every time and it's so annoying that im considering returning it. It would be perfect if they changed the design of the clasp so that it doesnt do this because the rest of the hat is great."
3.0,"they arent too heavy like many gauges are, which have the tendacy to stretch your ears further. but the crystals started falling out. i think i may have had these a month at the most, and i'm already missing 5 total from them.<br /><br />buy from TOLTEC TRADERS. their products are of much higher quality(past buyer)"
3.0,Super cute and well made.  Wish my 18 month old would keep it on her head.  I love that you can adjust the size of the bucket part of the hat so that she'll be able to wear it longer.  Would be better if it had the same type of clasp on the under-chin ties as it does to tighten around the bucket.  It would be a lot easier to quickly get on a moving toddler.
3.0,Doesn't look as it does in photo but it's fine for summer beach wear
3.0,"The masks look good, the graphics seem to be well done, the adult size is large(almost too large, for me anyway) and covers the face well. The only problem and the reason for the 3 stars is that the nose clip is far too weak. If it is going to perform it's duty as a mask the nose clip is the most important piece and this is where this mask fails. Put a much stronger nose bridge/clip on it and it would then be a 5 star mask.<br /><br />One other thing and I find this with pretty much all masks of this type and that is the filter pocket. The pocket does not cover the nose area at all/very well so unless your a mouth breather it will filter nothing. But this is a common flaw of these types of masks and I think it's more of a gimmick anyway."
3.0,Too short in length. My son can't wear this shirt
3.0,"I am typically a size 6 give or take, and the mediums are HUGE. They have a lot of stretch. I should have returned them but decided to keep them for those days when I'm feeling extra big and bloated. I may order smalls and see how they compare. If you are in between sizes or are unsure definitely order DOWN"
3.0,Material isn't very soft.
3.0,Very hard to open.
3.0,Runs way small... Cute shirt tho.
3.0,"This fits as expected and they feel really good. However, I have only worn/washed twice and the stitching has come loose/frayed. Not a hole, but I'm concerned without the extra stitching that they may just split down the seam at a very inconvenient time/location. üò¶"
3.0,"Very cute hat; alas, one size does not fit all. If your head is on the larger size, this will be too small."
3.0,Fabric was a bit thin.
3.0,I want to like this top.  I like the fabric and it's really cute but the shoulders are wider than the hemline.  and they put a seam up the back and it pulls at the bottom and looks funky. :(
3.0,"These are just ok. They work for Converse sneakers, but not Tom's, and definitely not dress shoes.The white pair that came in the set slides off my heel constantly. (The rest are fine)."
3.0,I bought it for myself in an X-Lrg and ended up giving it to my 13 year old daughter who is a size 0.  Thank goodness she's tall so it works for her.
3.0,These shoes are made cheaply but serve their purpose/
3.0,The product is nice but it‚Äôs definitely not going to fit a kid. It‚Äôs an adult size not a kids size. I was very disappointed that it didn‚Äôt fit a kid like it said it would.
3.0,Shirt seems nice but was smaller than I expected.
3.0,Well doesn‚Äôt fit as I was hoping.  I ordered XL because I like them big and it‚Äôs more a Large size
3.0,They are very cute.  The clip on the red one was broken when recieved but my son is actually using these and not hiding them like the plain ones
3.0,Inside lining of fleece is warm and cozy but the leggings don't seem to pull up high enough to fit in all the areas they need to.
3.0,"This two-piece set is made of 65% polyester and 35% cotton. It‚Äôs a very odd combination of materials. The flight part feels mostly like cotton. The black part mostly like polyester both of which are thin to medium in thickness. But the most unusual, and off-putting, part of this set is the leopard print. Unfortunately, they have tried to make it look like and feel like faux leopard fur.  I am really not fond of it. If it had simply been a fake leopard print that had been printed on fabric, then that would‚Äôve been fine. But as it is I neither like the look of it nor do I like the material<br /><br />I have the size large. The top measures 26 inches from the top of the shoulder to the bottom. The sleeves measure 25 inches from where they attach at the shoulder to the end. It measures 20 inches across in the middle. The bottom measures 39 ¬Ω inches from the top to the bottom. The inseam measures 26 inches. There is a 2 inch elastic waistband. There is no drawstring. The waste measures 25 inches before any stretch and they will comfortably stretch to about 36 inches. There are two side pockets.<br /><br />This set is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon. At the current price of thirty-seven bucks it‚Äôs well over twice the price it should be. As the sort of item you would pay ten bucks for in a discount store."
3.0,"It‚Äôs pretty and looks exactly like the picture. It fits the watch and my wrist well. It‚Äôs very thin which is what I wanted, since I type often.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the price is certainly reflected in the quality. It feels like a dense foam coated in thin vinyl paint rather than leather like I was hoping for. With normal wear I assume this one won‚Äôt last more than a couple months at best."
3.0,"I LOVE this necklace but after 3 or 4 wears, the finish is rubbing off. BUMMER!"
3.0,a little short because the skirt is wide at the
3.0,The yellow glasses are great for night. But the pair I'm used to was also useable during the day. These are way to bright. Not a big deal. But they are so beyond uncomfortable. It's rough plastic sitting directly on your face.
3.0,I work out everyday and I was excited to get these. But if you have a tummy- DONT GET THEM. I am returning them.
3.0,"I HATE bathing suit time im super picky, i want to be comfortable yet sexy/stylish. this suit actually fit my needs its flattering and comfortable 5'1 125lb 32DD i ordered a med.<br /><br />Sooooo its been less than a month and it broke....... i loved it but sad its broken and summer is just the beginning. :-("
3.0,Nice quality hat. Very big on my 12 year old.
3.0,Don't get me wrong if I could have fit this in my ear it would have been super rad. The way my industrial was pierced was at a different angle than the standard forward helix to the helix. Maybe if I had the traditional angle it might have worked out. I'm really bummed out I couldn't get it to fit. Otherwise the jewelry itself I had no complaints. Good quality and the center piece isn't saudered onto the barbell itself.
3.0,"I wouldn't exactly call this material soft. But, the shirt itsekf looks great on, and doesn't move around while I'm working out. I would say it's just okay."
3.0,Very overpriced but purchased as a gift.  Person loves it so I guess that's all that matters.
3.0,Cute but cheap looking.... But you get what you pay for
3.0,"Rubber insert makes it a pain to out these shoes on if wearing socks, and if not wearing socks, they &#34;stick&#34; to your feet.  I like the look of the shoes, but will never buy them again."
3.0,I'm not that big ... often get away with a medium. The XL is still too small for me.
3.0,"I love the material these shorts are made out of but the still was just not right. The crotch of the pants was so weird and It would bulge when sitting. It looked stupid so I am returning. Also, these did run large"
3.0,I bought the shirt as a costume piece for a play and I did compare size chart to the measurements of the actor.  It runs a little large.
3.0,The bottom is an ok fit but the top is way too big. It says this is a push up but its not at all and it cant be adjusted much to make if a better fit also the info in the details is way off about the model wearing it.
3.0,Beautiful dress<br />But I wear a 1X this dress is an XXL<br />It's a little right
3.0,The suit runs small but the cover up is nice!
3.0,"Very cute little girls boot for cold days.  Unfortunately, the finish is just a light topcoat-- like a layer of paint.  It easily nicks and scrapes off, especially at the toes. A boot for toddlers should have some sort of toe protection as you can be certain the toes are going to be scraped.  Also, the finish is a light nap which does not accept polish well."
3.0,Good for a swim coverup but very see/through and thin. The sleeves were a little too oversized in my opinion
3.0,color is alittle different than you see
3.0,Ripped as soon as I put them on. Very fragile
3.0,"I'm conflicted on this product...  It looks great (at first), but very quickly shows wear - scratches, and the seams that hold the steel mesh together start to wear out immediately.  It's light too, and thin, and holds almost as much stuff as the previous leather wallets I've had.<br /><br />The price is a bit high, given these issues I'm mentioning here.  Maybe steel mesh is expensive and difficult to manufacture, but it'd be nice (and make a lot more sense) if they's improve the thread used to sew the seams - because I can already tell this thing is NOT going to last me very long, and I treat it with care!<br /><br />Finally, if you're really concerned about the RFID or other signal blocking capabilities that are marketed on these, I'd look for something else.  My RFID card scans through the DEEPEST part of the wallet with ease - even easier than my old leather wallet (!).  Faraday cage, my arse!"
3.0,a little heavy and too small
3.0,it is very cheap but what can you expect for just a couple of bucks. I threw it away right after Halloween. but it went with the costume well.
3.0,It was pretty but broke after a few hours...
3.0,Please read the description before you buy. Not what I thought it would be
3.0,wish it was bigger
3.0,The connelly is good but the execution wasn't.  I have thick hair so when I curled it and teased it you could barely see the horns
3.0,"One star for product, 5 stars for seller...so giving it 3.<br />Zipper fails after second washing....opens up from center while wearing!  I bought 1 and loved how it fit and looked so bought 3 more not knowing after second wash they would all fail!  Now too late to return!  Going to try to reach seller!<br />Ok so update on seller...they refunded all of them even after time was out.  Hopefully zipper will get reworked..."
3.0,Alterations are necessary as the size chart is not correct.
3.0,OK purchase
3.0,"This is the jacket I wanted, and it is a great jacket. These do Not run true to size though. I am a medium, but this jacket fits me like an EXTRA LARGE. Other than that, I recommend this jacket. I will be returning it and hopefully ordering a smaller size."
3.0,"The fit was fine, it was just too boxy and material was a thin, but on another shaped body would have looked great.  Make sure you measure yourself to get the right sizing, don't compare to our sizing, you will get it wrong"
3.0,The main knot became undone within less than a day.
3.0,Sizing was off. Sent item back. Cute however! Would have kept.
3.0,"Nice product, they sent me the wrong colors."
3.0,Fits very loose
3.0,"Design was bolder than I thought from internet picture.  If the colors had been more muted, I would have kept the blouse.<br />I liked the blouse overall but it wasn't what I consider chiffon.  I didn't try the blouse on for fit / size because I was looking for a lighter, fluffier blouse with a softer-colored pattern."
3.0,Cute dress but it‚Äôs see through and the material seems too fancy for a beach day cover up.
3.0,Nice width
3.0,Love the first order but the reorder was shipped XXL and I ordered XL
3.0,The color is great very 'pop-y' it's cute but there is absolutely no place to put my breasts and I'm barely a B cup. Yeah..... Hubby *really* liked it when I tried it on but I can't leave the house in it....
3.0,Mine did not have a floral print just plain black. I will probably keep it because it‚Äôs the only dress I could find in Xsmall but bummed it‚Äôs pretty plain.
3.0,love it but get snagged easy and has no hem
3.0,A little tight fit.
3.0,We wear them as ankle bracelets because they were so large.
3.0,Nice leather but too big for my wrist and I don‚Äôt use it
3.0,"Not the greatest quality, worked for what I needed.<br /><br />Ray"
3.0,My 11-year-old daughter is heavily into cosplay  She got me to order this so that she could use it  I ordered a small adult woman size and thought that would be large enough for an 11-year-old  It is not.  The arms are too short and it will not button.  Other than that and the fact that it took over a month to get it it's a pretty nice coat.
3.0,All was able to use but the straight bar if your nose is thicker stick to the oval shaped designs
3.0,They‚Äôre comfy! Includes the phone pocket. They‚Äôre a slick material that creates ‚Äúsag ass‚Äù and slides down more than they should.
3.0,Love the look and feel of the sweater just don‚Äôt like the sizing
3.0,"The fabric is thinner than id thought. The colors are also brighter than in the picture-- more vibrant/bright than the jewel toned rich colors they had appeared to me in the pics above. Is as long as id thought tho-- im 115 lbs 5'4"" and Small hits right above my ankles."
3.0,"I  like it but it doesn't stay on my shoulders should have ordered a smaller size,that my only problem."
3.0,"Came with a seam not properly sewn in the bottom of the right cargo pocket. 5 minutes and ten stickers and they are almost worth the money.<br />  Ok. A few months have gone by and I'm adding to my first review. I'm not going to change the stars. They weight almost nothing but.. they are the only pair that gets caught on everything. Honestly, I took this pair and use them for rooftops installing AC  unide"
3.0,This jacket runs very small.  Weight of jacket is great.
3.0,They are just too short to be practical.
3.0,"Glasses fit ok. I'm not used to wearing eyeglasses, so it took some getting used to the impact on my field of view. Lenses took some effort to remove smudges."
3.0,"I‚Äôm a female with a tiny head. They were great for a couple laps in the pool and the suction was great, but because of my little head, they lost suction after about 10 laps. They would be awesome for a man with a big head. It looked like they were skiers goggles more than swimming goggles on me!"
3.0,Gave  as a birthday present to my dad.
3.0,This was ok but a little heavy. I didnt like it that much so I gave it to my daughter and she seemed to love it. I think its better for teenagers since they like to dress up on a daily basis
3.0,The Sterling seems perfect very sturdy. The pearls are great but smaller than I expected and I hate that there‚Äôs not the little push on caps to secure the earrings post so they won‚Äôt slip off
3.0,You get what you pay for. This looks nice but is of very cheap material and build quality. Easily rips and Buttons fall off. Good for a beach shirt that you don‚Äôt care about but that‚Äôs about it.
3.0,"very.....plastic. great for a laugh, but not something to actually be worn. speedy delivery."
3.0,Very long.  I have a short torso on top of being only 5‚Äô2 these shorts came up too right under boob and went down to almost right above the knee. Returned.
3.0,"I ordered these for a gift,but Im going to have to send back cause they seem to light and plastic for a a gift. They are nice for me,but maybe not for a gift."
3.0,"Very short and sexy which I don't mind. Ladies if your breast are not perky, so not the dress for you. Also if you a big rear, probably not the dress for you either. Thank me later."
3.0,not what i expected i would have to fix it for my shape
3.0,"It does not look as cute as in the pictures. Frankly, it looks more like a fox than a cat. But at least it still looks like an animal and is kind of cute, so I will wear it."
3.0,Worked well for our students Holiday program. I even decorated the hats a bit.
3.0,I would order a size down
3.0,I Love this
3.0,Don‚Äôt expect this material to stretch. My niece was only able to wear it once
3.0,Dress is cute but way to short!  Expect to wear it more as a shirt unless your child is short.
3.0,"The original cost stated $150.00; but I paid $45.00 so I thought I had a real deal. I found and bought  the purse at a discount purse shop for $15.00. Needless to say the $15.00 is probably a knockoff; but who is to say that the $45.00 purse isn't a knockoff too.  What I am trying to say is that we try to be savvy shoppers and look for the best deals and that might not be the case. The purse is nice, I'm just not sure it is worth the price."
3.0,"I bought two of these - one for my daughter and one for my niece. Both chains broke within minutes of having them on. I replaced the chains with ones bought at a local craft store and now the necklaces are just find. the pendant itself is great, just cheap and flimsy chains that can't hold its weight."
3.0,Got XL men‚Äôs size and it was not sized correctly. I‚Äôm a women‚Äôs medium and I fit in it my husband can‚Äôt wear it
3.0,It is a bit loose on the ear. One if fearful of tightening the cuff as it might break.
3.0,"The socks where nice when it comes to look and comfort, but I had some issues with the workmanship of the product.  When putting them on I had two socks get a tear on the side of the sock wear the top band meets the last stripe mid foot.  Additionally one of the socks had the tip of the toe sewn to the mid toe."
3.0,"I read the reviews on these & decided to get them anyway. Having said that, it was only because they were inexpensive & I figured they could hopefully work. The reviews stating that they are NOT like the other soft VIV Collection leggings were correct. These are totally different. They are scratchy & somewhat see through. Much more like a thick pair of tights without the feet. My main use for them is to wear with dresses that are toooo short & are more like a tunic. I can use these well for that purpose, but if you want to wear as pants with a shorter shirt, basically anything showing your underwear line, these are not going to work. Definitely more like pantyhose or tights."
3.0,Great shirt only complaint is that I had to sew every single button back on the shirt before even I got a chance to wear it! That‚Äôs the only reason for 3 our 5 stars other than that great shirt!
3.0,I think I just don't like this thong style. Somewhat uncomfortable and the waistband creates a visible line. But hey if it works for you then great.
3.0,Gold box deal. They're pretty but no one will mistake these for the real thing. I wasn't expecting them to be as large as they are.
3.0,EARRING IS PRETTY GOOD SIZE. SPARKLES ALOT.  LOOKS FAKE.. I WOULDNT RECOMMEND TO ANYMORE WHO ISNT LOOKING FOR ALOT OF BLING.
3.0,Mi talla es M. Pero Seg√∫n las medidas era L y esa fue la tallla que ped√≠ y me queda demasiada grande
3.0,These are definitely leggings. I ordered thinking they were actual harem pants. They are more like leggings with harem pant pockets. I'm going to keep them because they fit fine. I just can't wear them as intended. They are a comfy stretchy material.
3.0,"These shorts are cute, stretchy, and comfortable. They fit a little bit snug on me so if you like a tighter look they are true to size but If you want a more loose fit size up."
3.0,TKS
3.0,"True to size?  Not even close!  Unless you like tight fitting shirts, fo up a size."
3.0,I bought these based on sizing chart. I should have gotten medium. I love the fabric and fit but they are too big. I would order these again but with different size.
3.0,Very thin but the writing looks great and the colors. I got a 2x and it's more like a large
3.0,Unfortunately the watch started becoming delayed shortly after purchase. Changing the battery didn't work to fix it. I really liked it before that.
3.0,They keep fallen down around the waist..how ever they are very thick üòç  any see through at all
3.0,I probably just didn't do a good job reading the product description but these would fit a large toddler or small child for sure. Definitely too big for my 5 month old.
3.0,"Smaller then anticipated, but still ok. Very comfortable material."
3.0,Pretty steep price for what it its.  Supply and demand I guess.
3.0,this doesn't last long.
3.0,"I like the design & color of the stones. However, the silver setting/branch stem was not as pictured; it was wider/very pronounced taking away the delicacy of the piece. I returned it but will buy it again hoping to get earrings as pictured.."
3.0,"Not a 1:1, but not noticeable from far away so would be cute for pictures :)"
3.0,This bandana was a very pretty color in person but the fabric was disappointing. It didn‚Äôt have any substance & felt like cheap silk. As much as I had wanted to love it it didn‚Äôt make the grade. I sent it back.
3.0,"Got it today ,nice UNTIL one of the trinkle fell off  .üòîit is stainless steel it was hard putting it back on ,they ship it in a envelop ü§î"
3.0,"The material is very cheap, shiny almost plastic feeling. Also pretty short, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and usually I have the opposite problem. This would be cute for a Hawaiian themed party or something along those lines but the quality just isn‚Äôt good for much else. It does run true to size."
3.0,They are nice but they break easily (frame cracks) and the company policy is to only replace in the first 14 days and only with ALL original packaging. Very good looking glasses.
3.0,"Received this today in the black tie-dye colorway... it does look like the photo, however, is EXTREMELY thin, and very simply made. What you're getting is literally a square scarf that is folded in two, and tacked on each side for &#34;sleeves&#34;.... I'm not betting it'll last long, but it's cute for the price."
3.0,Doesn't fit me as well as some of the other in this same size.  The wires leave marks which I haven't experienced previously in this size.
3.0,This is a silky material. I'm not very fond of this shirt. Does not look anything like the picture.
3.0,it broke really fast
3.0,You definitely have to order a size or two larger....  This is not made for American sizes!
3.0,Beautiful pin. The colors are vibrant. The only complaint is the pin seems not so secure.
3.0,"I was really excited about this product. I tried it on. It was like my nipples were covered with two dorritos, the rest fit ok. It was comfortable (the fabric lace is very soft) and well constructed, sturdy. The color is lovely. Im kinda bummed because I thought even though I am top heavy, this would fit based on reviews. I wish I had not tried the top and bottom on together, or I would return for a different size. Fine for a sexy night in with your sig other (who likely appreciated more boob), but not for the purpose of chilling in, feeling cute. Would try this brand again, as I said its very well made for the price and comfortable. The bra size is not true sizing though."
3.0,Cute bathing suit but likely the reviews are correct. I would do at least a size up. They unfortunately didn't have the size up for me so I went with my regular size wishing for the best but it didn't work out. Barely contained my chest :)
3.0,Purchased in a large. Almost fits like an XXL. I do like the material.
3.0,"Love the feel! Real leather, buttery soft. It is not very consistently sewn together, meaning, one shoe was wider; the soles were different shapes. But. For price & being real leather, I will keep."
3.0,"I bought two of these to keep my beads in place. They look &#34;nice&#34;, nothing overwhelming about them. They are very simple and blend in well with the barrel clasp on my bracelet.  Unfortunately I lost one within a week because it didn't clasp shut very tightly. The one I still have isn't real tight and can slide along the bracelet if I catch it on something. Won't be ordering a replacement for the lost bead until I see how the one I still have left holds up."
3.0,I expected it to look just like the picture. The quality is a bit lower than I expected. The curls aren‚Äôt as textured as i intended them to be
3.0,Ripped before I even got the chance to wear them I took the cardboard cover off and one pair ripped
3.0,"Returned,felt wrong."
3.0,It‚Äôs definitely cuter in the picture but most clothes are. The lesson I learned was to zoom in on fabrics more before purchasing because when this arrived I was surprised the lace looked kinda grandma-ish.
3.0,Cute dress but too small on my arms
3.0,Doesn't feel like it's cotton and breathable. Looks good.
3.0,"I thought smile and quote would be larger, it is much too small"
3.0,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE SAME ITEM BY RUSSELL ATHLETIC BOUGHT A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH HAD BETTER FLEECE AND MADE ON A TUBULAR MACHINE (ONE PIECE,NO SEAMS)"
3.0,ITS AN OK SET...PRICE WASN'T BAD
3.0,I love it however I wore it for less than an hour and the pearls started falling off.
3.0,Sizing is much larger than normal. Ordered a 5T. But looks like a 6 or 7. Seems well made. I will hold on to it for next year.
3.0,I love the jacket and very well made.  I do wish I had ordered a size larger than I normally wear.
3.0,"This scarf is lovely and long, but it has nothing to do with silk or even mulberry.<br />It is 100% polyester with a satiny finish.<br />Why the makers/sellers are not more straight forward about this item is something I simply do not understand because it would be praiseworthy if described accurately.<br />If, however, you are expecting a silk or mulberry derived fabric based on the product page, then you will have reason to be upset with the pure polyester scarf you receive.<br /><br />To give a sense of how the scarf looks in different settings, I tried to show it in cool and yellow light.<br />The nice thing about this scarf is that it is long enough to go around your neck several times or to go around the lapels and collar of a coat or blazer.<br />This could easily dress up a winter jacket or outfit.<br /><br />The downside is that the fabric is very slippery.<br />You therefore need to pay attention to make sure it does not accidentally slip off you or your coat, getting lost/dirty.<br /><br />I recommend this as an extra long and lovely polyester scarf; I only wish the product page was clearer about the materials used to make this accessory."
3.0,"Says its wood but it only looks like wood. Feels light, cheap, and like it's made of plastic. No &#34;glow&#34; feature either. May look good, but it feels a bit cheap and too lightweight."
3.0,I love the look and feel of the swim suit but I could not wear it because the bra is too small.
3.0,"I like this dress, purchased in red, very pretty! Fits well but the top is see thru and requires a tank top underneath."
3.0,"Sized up one so they would be baggy, fit like they're 2 sizes smaller than my usual. Thin material that hides panty lines worse than most leggings I own. Well made if you're slim enough to fit the sizes."
3.0,"It‚Äôs not a typical sweatshirt it is T-shirt material, however it has held up and it‚Äôs adorable! We sized up for our son he is a little tall, and it fits good!"
3.0,"It does look pretty cool and will be perfect for my Medusa costume.  It is only one earring, not a pair."
3.0,"wasn't what I was expecting, clasp would just open on its own. Almost lost watch @ airport, and again in grocery store"
3.0,There was a slight scratch on one of the lenses.
3.0,"It's okay, I'll keep it but not what I was looking for.  A NASCAR T with no logo on the back ??? are you kidding me?  What the point?"
3.0,This item appears to be a light weight sweater but it‚Äôs just tee shirt material. Wish it were warmer and a bit thicker. It runs small.
3.0,"Ordered 2 sizes bigger, son will probably grow into it by the end of school year, not much bigger than him"
3.0,"I purchased jacket, in white. It fit as expected, smaller but read the reviews so I expected that. Took out of package and almost immediately thought is was dirty. The inside is sewn with a dark gray/blk material so the white appears dingy, except around the zipper.  Wouldn't recommend a light color  for this jacket."
3.0,Cute but small and  unable adjust.
3.0,"Immediately out of the box one earring did not light up, however I will still wear them around the holidays because they are cute even when not lit up!"
3.0,The metal arms are thin and very flimsy - not at all what I would expect from a $40 pair of sunglasses. Can't imagine they would last long.
3.0,They appear to be reasonably well made. However upon applying the mask there was a very distinct unpleasant odor which will require a washing before use. First face masks that have required this treatment. Make me wary about the chemical content of the material and whether or not it may be deleterious.
3.0,Item Must be plugged in. Heating pad separate not incorporated in the gloves. Material that holds the heating pad in place under the gloves is extremely cheap.
3.0,"Very pretty but received with a sharp piece sticking out of the back, like it was a reject."
3.0,"Doesn't work for me, had to pull the corset so tight to get any sort of cleavage and there's so much bra it sticks out of my top. It is comfy and still does its job just doesn't look like the photo on me :/"
3.0,"Great-looking shoe, with a great reputation - BUT.  While the size runs true, the width is narrow.  I ordered a 10 Wide, the shoe and box are both marked 10 Wide, but I cannot fit my heels comfortably into the shoes.  (The rest of my foot fits fine.)"
3.0,The fit was great! But the cups looked more coney and made my boobs look wonky.
3.0,My chest is hardly anything to worry about when I'm at the beach but this top was microscopic.
3.0,"Pretty romper, two sizes smaller than expected though"
3.0,"They are very dark.  Almost a dark chestnut brown, black.  It is a hard match to my tiger-eye pendant and they look almost nothing like the product pictured."
3.0,"Historically readers have lasted me several years , normally being changed out only when I need to up the strength.  I use them to knit, read, and eat. No roughhousing. I have gone through 2 pair of these in a year. The same thing happened to both. The  plastic into which the right hinge is embedded on the temples cracked and the hinges slid out. They are very pretty and I get a lot of compliments, but ended up with little bang for the buck. If they were $5.00, I'd say go for it, but not at the price I paid ($16.95). They are made by Calabria whose products I have been using for 10 years with little trouble.  These glasses, as pretty as they are, fell short."
3.0,"shoe was nice looking but way too small.  I usually wear a 7.5 to an 8, bought an 8 and if fit more like a 6.5 or 7.  way too small"
3.0,LOVE the shoe style. Runs large. 7 could be 6.5 or 6 even
3.0,Weird cut on top! I had boob spillage everywhere! Lol
3.0,I am fairly large chested with a small waist so I purposely bought a small (for the bottoms) and a large (for the top). I was sad to find that they are a horrible fit. The large was still too small for my d size boobs and the small was to large for my tiny ass. Very bummed. They don't look nearly as good as the model shown either.
3.0,i got it for my monroe & its alottt larger than i thoght
3.0,It was longer then regular size
3.0,I liked the colors of the stones but they were much smaller than in the photo.
3.0,"I bought this top in XX-large, and it's hardly a 'tunic' in that size. It ends about an inch below where a T-shirt would. So it's more a blouse or top than a tunic.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a lovely top. The lace is soft and feels lovely. The designs in the lace are outlined with a raised border.<br />It's stretchy, lined with a stretch material."
3.0,"Very cheap feeling, but look okay form a distance. Will be returning"
3.0,"I was looking forward to wearing this dress. Unfortunately, it fits very loose and looks frumpy."
3.0,"Pro:  I really like the style and look of the sweater.<br />Con:  the material is very rough and scratchy<br /><br />I believe it runs a hair small though, so I suggest going up a size."
3.0,"The boa looks good, just as shown on the picture. I got it for a Halloween party and by the end of the party the feathers were everywhere (chair, floor, table, etc.)"
3.0,"Just from reaching into my jacket, the thumbhole rubbed against a velcro patch and started coming apart."
3.0,It just sits on top of your head. Won't stay on. The beads keep falling off.
3.0,Latch broken
3.0,"I love the look, but they are really bulky and uncomfortable to wear"
3.0,"I like this purse because it has loads of compartments, however, it is a little heavy."
3.0,Love the packaging! I didn't realize it has zero boob support and for a plus size girl that is important. Cute but not something you can wear if need to be modest or worried about showing to much clevage.
3.0,It‚Äôs super cute! The shorts run very small though.
3.0,"Love it when I first got it. Comfortable and easy to care for.  But, as with anything that‚Äôs trendy fashion these days, clothes aren‚Äôt made to last at all. After about a dozen washes, it‚Äôs already looking so used, stitches are frayed, and fabric stretches too much.<br /><br />Not recommended."
3.0,Loved the color and feel of the leggings but the crotch area and waist were too loose for a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 99lb! Was not flattering at all. Was so disappointed bc I rly loved the color
3.0,"The delivery took forever. It took so long, I thought my package was lost in the mail. It is a little bigger and thicker than I would liked. I wanted this for bartending but it looks like I will wear for costume parties."
3.0,This is my everyday necklace it is cute and goes with everything I have. my only negative is that it is cheap but you get what you pay for.  not a bad necklace for the price
3.0,"First of all, I love the swim dress.  It fits great, it's flowy and so pretty.  However, boy shorts are not included with the swim dress.  The bottoms that ARE included are skimpy bikini bottoms.  I'm keeping the swim dress, and using boy shorts from another swim suit that I own.  Disappointed, but love the dress part too much to return."
3.0,I liked the idea of the different ways to wear it but the fabric looked very cheap so I returned it.
3.0,Arm holes are really large
3.0,Its a little bit small.
3.0,"Not for me, is this an Asian style fit?Tight and stretchy across the chest. Fine if you like that, but not for me."
3.0,"You have to be careful the ""stone"" doesn't fall out. Pretty sure its not a real stone."
3.0,"These are pretty small, even on my wife's face."
3.0,"Fit is kind of awkward. Loose around abdomen. Material is a little thin so will need to wear something underneath, but that ruins the looks of it. Otherwise, cute."
3.0,very pretty dress but it runs really large.  we got a five and it was two sizes to big.  will return and get a smaller size
3.0,"When I received this band, I liked it until I put it on my wrist. The feel of the band is premium and has a nice weight to it. I did not feel like a cheap knockoff, but the magnets were not strong enough to hold firm for longer than a minute when I put it on. It kept falling off. This has the potential of being a worthy band with stronger magnets."
3.0,"I had oakley laces for two deployments and they finally gave out on the third.  They are ok laces, I have only had them for 2 months but they are already starting to wear down.  I  walk around the base all day which shouldn't be a huge factor.  Wouldnt get them again if I can get my Oakley laces."
3.0,"These were a little bit snug in the waist for my 3T child. The length was fine. The colors in person look more faded (muted) than in the photo online. Also, the quality is not very good. The fabric is quite thin and the weave is quite loose. The shorts arrived with a couple of threads already hanging. The reason I'm giving these 3 stars and not 2 is because my son seems to like wearing them, and I think he finds them comfortable."
3.0,wife thought the style was ok. Good price
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äô and 190lbs and I ordered an XL which was a typical size for me on amazon. It was too long and too big. My husband tried it on 5‚Äô10 and 225 lbs and it fit him pretty nice! Lol but he doesn‚Äôt wear dresses unless it‚Äôs for a joke.<br />So I gave it to my sister, 5‚Äô10 and 250lbs and it fit her too but wasn‚Äôt flattering on her stomach. She gave it to her coworker who is somewhere between our sizes and she rocked it! So‚Ä¶weird dress. It may have worked for me if I ordered a medium instead bc it‚Äôs so long and stretchy."
3.0,The description states 100% cotton and Plush Backed Waistband.  I received 55% cotton 45% polyester and not the waistband pictured.  I am returning the item.  This version is not soft at all.  Like a cheaply made wrinkled dress shirt that is thin.
3.0,"The earrings are pretty. Some are very heavy and stretch the lobes. The screw backs are a pain to get on and off, leave ample time to fuss with them while putting them on in the morning!"
3.0,The color is much closer to bronze than vintage copper.
3.0,It says it fits 44DDD but I spill out of it. Wanted something other than a regular bra as my straps kept falling down while doing yoga. By the end of the hour I‚Äôm just about completely out of it. I do like how it fits across my back. It‚Äôs very comfortable.
3.0,Fabric is much heavier than expected
3.0,"Don't go by the size chart, if you normally wear a medium, buy a medium. I bought the XL because I went by the size chart; too large."
3.0,Nice necklace but still trying to figure out what I will wear it with.
3.0,"Super soft, would have loved them if they weren't so small.  Gave them to my girlfriend, she loved them."
3.0,"Very pretty, and well made, but small. It isn't nearly as &#34;off the shoulder&#34; as the picture, and it rides up constantly."
3.0,The toe part was too big
3.0,"Although the disk were very colorful, the designs were a little too ‚Äòbusy‚Äô in my humble opinion.  Bold colors instead of tiny details would have been better.  I‚Äôll be selling these for a mere $3.00 each. ."
3.0,I absolutely loved it!! But returning today because it‚Äôs too small.
3.0,I like these I just don‚Äôt like the back string it leaves the mark on your ankle and leaves it red.
3.0,"Great logo design, good material but size runs small. I ordered a size Large and fits like a medium. I have it to my son cul√© not wear it."
3.0,Decent product. Personally I prefer bibs so the pad stays in place.
3.0,Does the job but is nothing spectacular. Arrived on time. Ordered a size small which had somewhat of an irregular fit but I decided to keep it. Probably would purchase elsewhere next time.
3.0,"Cute. However the silver one was broken when I received it. Amazon refunded my money. But the silver one is the one I actually wanted and don't want to purchase a two pack again. If it weren't the broken like the gold one, wouldve been very nice and cute."
3.0,Not as it is pictured! The top handles are not that long. they are about 4-5 inches long. Also the front zip pocket is not leather as the other Ariana bags are. It is nylon. The plum color is beautiful.
3.0,The beige is a baby pink. Still soft and comfy but not the color I expected.
3.0,I liked the purse and the color however it broke in several places within a few months .
3.0,"The quality of the jewelery seems to be good. But I only received 7, instead of the advertised 10. I was missing both of the silver ones and one of the colorful ones."
3.0,"It runs a size too small compared to what is shown.  That being said, everything else about this vest is great!  Just order a size larger than what you normally wear, and you should be fine.  I reordered one a size larger and it is a perfect fit...couldn't be happier with it!"
3.0,It's really large and hard to breathe through...cute picture though
3.0,"It's very pretty, but kind of cheaply made, and not as big as I was hoping"
3.0,"You get what you pay for so I didn't expect this to be the omg!  Magic trick but I am upset I ordered gold and got silver üò¢ I don't wear silver so this will never be worn and thefore is a waste of my money , other then the order not being correct,  it is a good product for the price it is smaller the. It looks though and looks a bit cheaper than the pic , but I expected that for the price"
3.0,Bought 7 of these at the same time and they all came in different sizes so that made it very hard cuz some didn‚Äôt fit good
3.0,The body of the purse is nice but the straps are too short and very cheap looking. I've thought about redoing the straps.
3.0,"This was bought for me as a gift. Things to know:<br />This is un-lined & a fragile garment.<br />The size runs small, & the armseye runs very small.<br />The &#34;N7&#34; graphic is unfortunately placed so that the chest distorts it during wear, larger busts showing more distortion.<br />The fabric itself is thin.<br /><br />I like the idea of this garment & a small, small armed, & small busted Fem Shep may give this five stars. This criticism is meant to be constructive rather than snarky."
3.0,This shirt slips and rides up.  Won't stay in pants when tucked in and rides up when outside pants. I constantly have to pull down.
3.0,smaller than expected. Other than that they are ok
3.0,I love these gloves I wish it would stay winter all year round
3.0,Some clips locking spring gave up after a short while.
3.0,Don‚Äôt stay waterproof long my feet get wet everyday after a few months. Not worth the money even on sale
3.0,These are cute but really small.
3.0,"Whenever I take off my watch, I have to adjust it back to the size that I need. The band is really too big for the space where it attaches to the side of the face watch."
3.0,Front stuck way out. Bra small.
3.0,its good...but it could make some improvements.
3.0,would have sized .up 2x my normal size . tiny and not great if you have a bigger chest
3.0,"I collect sunglasses and i actually love the looks of theese ones, but i hardly ever use them because the make my head ache really bad, i use cheap chinesse sunglasses all the time and have no problem with them, but this ones are a torture, i have the hypothesis that the source of the problem is the deformed  transparent lens layer, them would be perfect without that issue, i received a ton of complements, and some critics that also enjoyed, like &#34;you look like a supervilan&#34; LOL"
3.0,This looked great but once she tried it on realized it's not exactly as sjown and top will only fit someone with a  narrow and small chest. There's no space between the two cups. Had to return.
3.0,"Cool mask. Has a protective insert. It‚Äôs not an N95, but it still feels pretty protective. Wore it for Philippine Independence Day Parade in NYC."
3.0,"Looks cool.<br />Pretty large 40mm face. Because it has very little unused space, the watch comes across as being quite a bit bigger than typical 35mm diameter watches.<br />Nice leather strap rather than rubber/plastic.<br />Biggest issue is that it seems to run 1min slow each day!<br />Maybe it's got a weak battery, but I just got it!"
3.0,Very pretty but a little too heavy for my ears
3.0,"Sweater isn‚Äôt bad but the problem with many xxx large sweaters is the neck collars are huge most people, even over weight people, don‚Äôt have 32‚Äù necks. Common problem among big people and not limited to any specific brand. I recommend getting measurements done if your someone over weight or don‚Äôt fit a traditional size."
3.0,I Bought these shoes for wedding that my toddler was in as flower girl . I bought her normal size but they wouldn‚Äôt stay on her feet
3.0,Very thinly made.
3.0,"These earrings look like the picture & seem to be holding up pretty well. However, I don't think they're white gold plated, as indicated, which is why I'm only giving 3 stars. The earring backs are turning blue-green from use, & the posts & prongs are starting to tarnish. On the plus side, the earrings seem to be very sturdy. I take them out before karate 3-4 times a week, then put them back in, & after more than a month of doing this, they are holding up just fine. Even with the metal tarnishing, the earrings themselves still look nice, since so little metal is visible while wearing. I have several piercings, so while I'm not pleased with the metal, overall, it was an ok purchase.<br /><br />ETA (4/13/17): Someone commented & must have realized their error & deleted the comment. The description at the time of this review clearly states the earrings are white gold plated over stainless steel. I just wanted to clarify to avoid any more snarky comments in my email box. ;-)"
3.0,"Not bad, not as tight as I would have liked, 5'8&#34;, 120 lbs, I ordered a small. Good for a casual dress."
3.0,Little too big.
3.0,"By US standards I wear a size 14 blouse.  I ordered a 3X and it comes no wear near fitting.  This blouse is made for pencil thin women, not for woman with a little meat on their bones.  I am handicapped and forced  to  shop online. However if  Amazon can't do a better job of ordering for American women they are going to lose my business."
3.0,shoes not in their original box
3.0,"This shawl is one-size and it's pretty big. Feels and looks like wearing a blanket. I'm 5'6"" and 125 lb, normally wear Small size tops - you can see how the ruana looks on me in the photos. Pretty big. The faux pearl embellishment looks nice - the pearls are silver colored and look kinda metallic. But I do think the pearls make it a little less comfy/cozy - the rest of the shawl is fuzzy and soft but the pearls are hard. The pearls are only in the front, so it's really designed to be worn open in front. You could wear it like a scarf or wrap, but the pearls wouldn't show."
3.0,Se transparentar pero es un buen vestido para estar en casa o como coverup
3.0,Thin material. Buttons not sewn tight. Looks like the buttons will fall off quickly. Flattering cut. But cheaply made.
3.0,The straps dig in you shoulder. They aren‚Äôt strong. The part that covers your chest fits great.
3.0,Nice coat looks üëçüèº nice<br />Only problem is under arm area has large holes have to return now!!! my son has to go longer without a coat üò§üò©üôÑ
3.0,"I bought two of these, one in grey and the other in blue. They are warm, fit well but the blue one has pilled terribly after just a few washes. The grey one is fine."
3.0,"I like the style of the dress. I thought the material would have been a little heavier and because it took a while longer to reach me, instead of returning it for a smaller size, I will take it to a seamtress to adjust the fitting."
3.0,"This is a gorgeous dress, but most definitely for girls with bigger boobs"
3.0,These are a little on the flimsy side for larger gauges. I have 1 inch and they kept rolling up. I'm sure they would be perfect for smaller sizes. They're very thin but the colors are great!
3.0,"I have to admit the buckle on this belt is nice. Very good finish. The size is true as well. Where I have an issue is with the ""Italian leather"" advertising, but nothing on the belt or the box says anything about Italy.<br /><br />I've used leather belts all up and down the line... from Gucci (used), Coach, all the way down to Dickies and no-names. This leather is above average. It's not some fine craft or anything. It's stamped leather and kind of stiff with just an okay finish. I would not normally be so harsh, but to trumpet Italian leather and send this, it's deserved."
3.0,Fits a little small and is a pain to iron.
3.0,I have to use a strapless with no cup because it is tight on my chest.
3.0,Really excited about this product. Glad I got it!
3.0,"So comfy, but not flattering. Very wide and makes me look fat. Just kind of a sack fit. I thought it was cute. Paired it with a jean jacket. Then I saw pics of me wearing it, and I thought- yikes. That‚Äôs not cute. I‚Äôm a size 4-6 and 5 feet tall. Just not good for a short girl."
3.0,"Apparently MY BLACK SKIN AND BLACK BODY EVEN COMPLETELY COVERED IS AN ISSUE; but every other race of female can post reviews in bikinis down to UNDERWEAR.<br /><br />I have ALREADY reviewed this, and Amazon is ERASING reviews without my knowledge or consent. Even declining reviews, that had NO issues to begin with. I am documenting every review, as I have for the past year; I add them to my notes, and then email them to myself. All my reviews usually have pictures and videos, but nobody likes RESUBMITTING HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS WITH HUNDREDS OF PHOTOS.<br /><br />Absolutely love it, but I would suggest sizing up as it is not true to size. It does have some stretch as you wear it through the day, but the not stretch of maybe workout clothes. Love that it's a 3 piece, you can wear the jacket or not. I only wear this at home, but can be a cute outfit for a shopping trip. I did get a hole in my pants on the inner thigh quickly, so I don't think it'll last long."
3.0,"These leg warmers would probably work better over fabric. Unfortunately I wanted them to keep my calves warm and wore then without anything underneath and they don't seem to have any elastic... So they just stretched out fast and fell down my legs. In all fairness though, I don't have very large calves either.<br /><br />I only have them a 3* because they wouldn't stay up in my legs."
3.0,Cant complain for 12 bucks. Definitely aren't quality shades but they are better than nothing.
3.0,"Hubby likes them, so we buy them. I just wish that at $70/pair (?!?!), they didn't fall apart when washed on gentle and hung to dry. Usually starts by the 3rd wearing, sometimes sooner. He has worn these, or earlier versions, for many years. The older ones held up much better, and cost less, if memory serves about $15 less a pair. Another company that has cheaped out on quality, and jacked prices. If he'd try something different, I'd never give them another dime. Due to a past surgery, he needs the support these provide, and they are good for that."
3.0,"The color and material is nice. I'm 5 ft 5in and this is way too short. Comes up mid calf, and I don't have long legs. I was hoping it would be floor length. My fault for not checking the measurements."
3.0,"Too short for my mom bod , good material and neck line is perfect. So disappointed that it was so short , it fits not like a crop top . I am sure it is super cute on the right body type"
3.0,"I'm a tiny person - 5'4&#34; and about 100 pounds. If a size small doesn't fit me, I'm not sure who it's supposed to fit. I typically wear a size small in juniors clothing (sometimes even an xs) and always an extra small (or even an xxs) in ladies' sizes. This sweater barely fit me and it was uncomfortable. According to the size guide provided, I should have been able to fit an xs! Be sure to size up two sizes when you buy.<br />The sweater itself, outside of the poor sizing, is great quality. It's very thick and probably very warm.  Nice long sleeves which I definitely prefer on a sweater."
3.0,"Tried these out and had mixed feelings.<br /><br />They feel good and even with the gel strap in place are comfortable to wear, they do take a little getting used to as they hug your body pretty snug and if your not used to briefs that do then give it some time.<br /><br />I liked the idea of the gel ""belt"" that holds the shirt in place, it does work... mostly. I found that my shirt was becoming a little untucked at the love handle area, but the item has a noticeable effect on keeping a shirt from ballooning out or becoming untucked altogether. NOTE- Your shirt must fit properly, meaning it cant be too big or too small, otherwise this item wont do much for you.<br /><br />One thing that could really use some work, is the crotch area. There is no access door or slit for bathroom breaks, so you have to pretty much untuck and undo everything before you can relieve yourself, even standing up. Was rather surprised this was overlooked, but it does give you a chance to ""readjust"" everything before you leave the bathroom. Word of warning: this process can be a bit of a juggling act if your wearing loose fitting slacks with a belt, as trying to get everything in place while holding up your pants isnt as easy as it sounds. You may not want to stand at a urinal while wearing these.<br /><br />Overall I think for some fits this may work well, others perhaps not so much, but if you really have a balloon issue then it may be worth a try."
3.0,Ok. Looks rather cheap.
3.0,I do wear my  new wrap but for us plus size ladies it could wrap further for us modest ladies.
3.0,"These are decent for someone who is nervous about bare feet in yoga class, or who is doing yoga at home with no mat (why?) and getting sweaty feet. However, realistically, you should have a yoga mat, you should feel OK about your feet, and you shouldn't really need these. Also, sometimes the area around the toe feels really tight, like it's cutting off circulation to your toes. However, the non-slip action is strong; you definitely won't slip. I guess get them if you feel you need them, but you probably don't need them."
3.0,The size was too large for medium!
3.0,I had to send this item back this item was much too large and I am now going to reorder a smaller size of this item but I did like the way the item is made and the pockets on the side and  way the item looked
3.0,"I recently received this wrap dress and was initially excited about the velvet material and the gorgeous blue color. However, upon trying it on, I was disappointed to find that it did not flatter my curvy figure (I'm 5'2"" and 140 lbs). Despite this, I have to say that the dress itself is beautiful and the full sleeves add a nice touch. However, because it doesn't look good on me, I haven't worn it even once and it's just sitting in my walk-in closet. Overall, I would give this dress 3 stars."
3.0,"very thin material, kinda cheap, would not buy again."
3.0,"These pants we‚Äôre almost like a thin pillowcase material. There was no label, front ..back ..anywhere. I wasn‚Äôt even sure which were the front or the back since they were identical. All the pleats made my butt look humongous.<br />These are for a thinner and taller persons that doesn‚Äôt care about quality and disposable clothes."
3.0,"Loved this watch, gave my garmin a very elegant look with this rose gold band.  The only downside was that metallic smell and a bit of rusting. Should you wear this band for special occasion it may be worth it. But definitely not suitable for everyday wear ( ps. I did not shower or exercise with this band)"
3.0,"First off, they're quite comfy and warm on the inside. My room gets a bit cold and the concrete floor is icy, so as far as overall comfort, they're decent. However....if you look at the top stitching around the toes on the outside, it's uneven and looks like it was made on a tilt. That's where the two stars come off but not bad for the price."
3.0,Its soooooooo pretty! Was so happy when I got it and it came right on time!!
3.0,The earrings are beautiful but after 1 month they change colors . I thought they were sterling silver. If they are not then Ingit what I paid for. Would have preferred to to have the real thing. ü§î
3.0,"The chains are very weak, they fall apart and you have to adjust every rings before actually wear it.<br />But once you finally have it on, it looks cute."
3.0,I would just want the shoulder straps to be just a bit longer.  Otherwise ok.
3.0,"Good size, and stitching, material weight is a too light and slightly see through."
3.0,"This backpack really is lightweight! And can be folded down for easy storage when not in use rather than clutter up a closet until it‚Äôs needed. But it is still the size of a normal one large pocket backpack (with a smaller front pocket)! I was able to fit an oversized beach towel, regular towel, set of clothes, pair of tennis shoes, bag of dog treats, leash, and 2 water bottles in this backpack to have for a race. It also held all my clothes for a 4 day beach trip (toiletries did not fit though), so it would be perfect for a weekend or overnight trip where you just want to take a backpack. It is definitely not meant to carry anything heavy since it is lightweight and thin. You can also feel the shoulder straps digging into your shoulders with heavy items because there is no padding (again, since it is supposed to fold up and is light weight). Overall, I am pleased with this bag for the price. It‚Äôs a go to now for when I take my dog places to put all his stuff in easily. I have noticed some wear with how the zipper works 3 months in because I use it often and have overstuffed on  occasion, but it still works fine. Some of the inside seams are starting to unravel near the zipper, unsure if from overstuffing as well."
3.0,"The stone is red when held up to light from the back but looks brown when on the finger.  Apart from this, the setting and the cabochon are nice enough for the price for male or female.  Doesn't really look as important as the picture."
3.0,This was a beautiful purchase but my daughter is disabled which means she is a bit rough with her clothes.... so I am not sure if it was the material and how it was made or how rough she was playing but the skirt ripped off the bodice within 30 days.
3.0,The fit was okay. Doesn't have the same compression as others I've purchased from this seller. Overall pleased.
3.0,"Easy to install on the watch with the quick release pins. Nice looking and lightweight watch band. Only giving it 3 stars because it has sharp corners and it keeps getting caught on all my clothing, which is incredibly annoying! Also, if you aren't careful when taking it off, the band comes out and you have to re-loop it through which is another annoyance.  I had a similar band for my vivoactive watch but it was thicker and the edges never got  caught on fabric."
3.0,I do like this sweatshirt but the colors are exact as I expected. It isn‚Äôt as bright and cute as the picture. It appears more like printed colors than a dyed colors. This did fit as expected though.
3.0,I love the color but hate the material it is made out of. It reminds me of rainboots or something similar. In a way it's fine since I often have to walk through mud but they are so wide that I feel like they are going to fall off and it's obvious they are too wide. I'm not sure getting a smaller size would help as length wise they fit fine and I think if I went a smaller size my toes would be curling up.
3.0,"These socks are so very pretty, and I wanted so badly to be satisfied with them, but I had to return them.  The problem is the non-skid dots on the bottom where the ball of the foot is. If these were not raised, they would have been just fine, but because I am on my feet for many hours at a time, the raised shapes became quite painful."
3.0,"I love the necklace. I have been wearing it for almost a month and get many compliments. However, straight out of the package, I had to cut off the black necklace string. It was crumbled and bent. The material seemed cheaply made to where it would not straighten back out. After removing it, there is only the gold chain left which is fine, although I would have preferred to have the two colors."
3.0,Nice shirt but runs alot smaller than the sizes should be
3.0,"This mask is just ok, it doesn‚Äôt really cover a man‚Äôs face well.  It should be much bigger."
3.0,Outfit beautiful fit as expected thanks to the reviews I knew to get a large BUT the quality of the zipper is horrible. Not even two hours into my night the zipper split and I had to leave the event I was attending.
3.0,"perfect size for my 'grandma' locket that was started for me and I spent a long time researching how to add more so they matched. As others have said, the colors are a bit off. I had a hard time picking another blue sapphire to match. That said, there are lots of stones. happy I didn't err on the size."
3.0,it didn't seem to fit right. it was too small in the breast area but then had a big space under the arm so you could see all of my bra. it was an odd fit so I will be returning it
3.0,"just a little bigger than I anticipated. I was thinking to wear it on my cartilage ear piercings. Since it‚Äôs bigger, it hangs loose and kind of dangles as if lopsided. Too small too tight to wear on the ear lobes. So unfortunately had to return."
3.0,"My 6 year old granddaughter was very excited to have her first watch!  I think the concept of the watch is great but there were a few things that I thought needed improvement .<br />After wearing it for thirty minutes my granddaughter asked me to take the watch off because the band was ""itchy"".<br />The numbers on face of watch and the writing on minutes and hour hands are very, very small.<br />I agree with the mom who said the multi colored watch was confusing...too many different colors on the watch face is a distraction... although I bought the multi colored one with the purple band because purple was my granddaughter's favorite color.  If I had to do it over again I would have purchased the less colorful watch.  Easier to ""read"".<br />Overall, she was thrilled but she doesn't wear it."
3.0,"I did purchase the slim fit version of this shirt, but it was a bit more narrow than expected.<br /><br />The material is very thin material - a lot thinner than expected.<br /><br />It is fine for its price, but I do not expect it to last the season intact."
3.0,Very cute and okay for an couple hours out or to church but not too comfortable.
3.0,A little tighter than the black one I bought of the same brand.
3.0,I ordered a XL. I am a curvey female and was looking for a hoodie to workout in. This thing is ginormous though! I‚Äôm thinking about keeping it just to have a ginormous hoodie laying around. May come in handy one cold lazy day.
3.0,"I would definitely order up a size. I got a medium and it fits but slightly snug. I‚Äôm keeping it but if you are looking for a looser boyfriend type fit,size up. Other than that, good quality and what I was looking for. Matched pic"
3.0,Great look for 1 day. Stones felt off within 3 days.
3.0,nice ring but the paint is chipping off. sad because it looks pretty sweet otherwise.
3.0,"I think that did it all.  It would be great for most Halloween costumes,  just was too costume for me."
3.0,Not made for a long torso.
3.0,"I've bought these same glasses here repeatedly each time they break. In your pocket? Nope, no good. Gonna break. Cleaning them often? Don't use isopropyl rubbing alcohol or anything that will damage weak plastics.  They will literally crumble. Sometimes the lenses will pop up. They're really the only glasses I like. Not sure if I can justify buying them yet again at that price point though. I currently have almost one side of the frames covered in copper tape. Worked as a quick fix, not so fashionable anymore though. Still, I liked the coverage."
3.0,It‚Äôs a lot smaller than I expected.
3.0,Very stretchy- doesn't hold shape and is somewhat see through.
3.0,It feels a little bulky when wearing.  It also doesn't engage as shown in video.
3.0,Smaller than I thought it would be<br />But seemed well made.<br />It was a gift and they liked it and thought it would be very useful
3.0,THis suit was to large so I returned the suit to amazon. and bought another one that fits fine.
3.0,Some have a very itchy material that have caused rashes on me and friends.
3.0,This is too small for a size 7 wrist.
3.0,"I received several compliments on the band over the first few days and really liked it. Unfortunately, it only took a few days of wear before the area between the strap holes started to fray. I am sending it back as defective as no band should deteriorate as quickly as this one is..."
3.0,Very cute shoe. Cut small. My daughter is in a 8 and I got an 8 1/2  and its now to small. So I would order a whole size up
3.0,Bigger than expected. Not comfortable at all either. The fabric is very scratchy. I should have returned it but forgot about it.
3.0,Pretty enough design but it doesn't feel like anything more than plastic.
3.0,I feel these run big & i returned them the thumb was twice as long as my finger. Circumference was very big & I don't feel I have a small hand.
3.0,I returned it because I felt the neck line was too high and the material wasn‚Äôt cotton like I had hoped but it was nice
3.0,"I originally bought this dress in the sunflower pattern. It fit great and the length hit right above my knee. I am 5 foot four and 150. When this dress arrived I had hoped that it would fit the same as the sunflower dress, It‚Äôs about 4 inches shorter . It will have to be worn with leggings. Disappointing"
3.0,Wife says the band has a hard time staying in the groove. 3 stars due to this.
3.0,Sized and this barely hit the top of my jeans. I'm a size 6 in banana republic for reference. Bought a large. Color (light pink) is not really great either. Returned
3.0,"Price was 4.99 but when I clicked they were different price, 7.99?"
3.0,Cheaply made but my son likes it so we kept it.
3.0,This dress is sized incorrectly. I ordered a medium and it's a bit tight in the chest. The slip that only goes just past the knees is cheap looking. The outer layer hits at the ankles so im not able to wear heels with it. I purchased a sash belt to glam it up. I don't have time to re-order a large before the wedding as shipping takes a while so I just have to deal with it üòî<br />The entire dress is SEETHROUGH. even where the slip lays- FYI
3.0,"Had to send it back. Too big. Not a bad product, though."
3.0,"Beautiful, (when new), comfortable, had to order larger size, doesn't hold up to hard work, scratches easily."
3.0,"The jacket is awesome, but the zipper sucks. I would return the jacket if I could. It's very comfortable and looks great, but the zipper killed it for me."
3.0,"Size is exactly what I want, small volume for a day pack. Lots of molle attachment points. Adjustability is obviously for a much smaller person than me, 6 foot 2 inches, 230 pounds. Best purchase for a youth or a petite woman, not a large man!"
3.0,"I received a tortoiseshell with wood-armed glasses in a round shape. I ordered oval metal. These are cute so I will keep them, but way off."
3.0,"So these shoes say they re for both men and women. So I ordered the size I normally wear. Well, they are way to big. So, if your a women ordering for youself, you need to figure out what your size is in men's shoes. Cuz they are actually sized to men's. They are warm and comfy...I just feel like a clown wearing them..so I don't wear them tht often."
3.0,"This necklace is ok. The color is ok. I guess it serves its purpose, however, I would not buy it again!"
3.0,"Works ok i guess, packs make it heavy, it gets so hot and dry here, it‚Äôs hard to tell how much it is helping.<br />I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs very effective in temperatures above 100 degrees, sucks for me."
3.0,"This band feels nice and looks nice. I put 3 stars on easy to install because  though it is easy to install, it apparently is not meant to be taken off. I've had the strap for a bit over a week, went to switch it today out and the silicone ripped up by one of the connectors. I got my fiance the dark blue one and his was fine, so maybe I just got a bad one, but it's a little disappointing."
3.0,This was exactly what I was looking for and needed for my four year old‚Äôs first pair of glasses. They are easy to adjust and get on and off of her head even when attached to the glasses. However the little plastic clasp didn‚Äôt last long. Especially for a four year old. It still works because it isn‚Äôt completely broken but the plastic has bent and won‚Äôt snap in properly which doesn‚Äôt hold the glasses snuggly anymore.
3.0,"Pretty, loved them at first but only good for a couple uses. They rusted after a week and turned my daughters ears green"
3.0,Hard to tell how tall the hat is from the pictures.  I prefer a lower top.  The hat itself is good quality and a really nice hat just not my preference.
3.0,"It says fits adult sizes 5-11 but I think that would only be accurate for women.  I think that this might fit a man's size 9, at the biggest."
3.0,"Skirt is a little smaller than anticipated but will work for what I'm going for.<br />Color is bery close to the picture.<br />Few issues with how the product is made: because of the way it was serged, I have a small tear on one of the seams of the skirt on the waist band. In all honestly, it looks like a section about 1.5-2inches of fabric were not sewn and included in the waist band. The hem also had some weird serger threads hanging off in various places. Because I have some experience in sewing, I'm confident that I can easily fix it.<br />Also, the &#34;lining&#34; is super sheer and short. For whatever reason, it's shorter in the back and longer in the front. It's so short that it barely covers anything. I ALWAYS wear a pair of spanx or spandex shorts under my skirts so I don't really see this as a huge problem, but it might be for others.<br />I ordered an XL lavender skirt. I'm 5'4&#34; and usually wear about a 12 or 14 in bottoms. I feel a 2x or even a 3x would've been a better fit but XL was the largest size available<br /><br />With that said, the skirt is actually really cute, light weight, and twirly. I went with 3 stars because, while there are some issues, it's nothing that I can't come up with a solution for and it's still super adorable"
3.0,Cheesy material!!
3.0,LITTLE TOO THIN AND FLIMSY.
3.0,"I have a white burnout Tee of this same brand and it fits perfectly, so, I ordered one in black.  The black one fits tighter and I haven't even washed it yet!  Hope I can still wear it when I do wash it."
3.0,Beautiful but bulky and ill fitting. I should have ordered a size larger but not sure that would alter the way the cups fit. They are too close together. It is not a comfortable fit
3.0,Really liked the style and cut of the pants.  They do run a bit smaller than the suggested measurements.  When I tried to exchange I was told I could but it would take weeks to get my refund.
3.0,Came apart from the belt after my daughter just tried it on. Had to use safety pins to hold it together. Other then that it's fine
3.0,I ordered the wrong size. I was thinking it was a package of a variety of sizes.
3.0,the bells are perfect size. and the shipping was extremely fast. the only issues are one bell is dented in....and one clip is falling off. but I can easily glue the clip back on. idk about the dent tho lol.
3.0,This is a very cute bathing suit. we ordered twice because we really loved the look. however it runs super small even for our tiny daughter and one of them was missing ruffles on one side. Had to return both.
3.0,Seemed smaller nice fabric
3.0,I love these necklaces I purchased these for my two daughters for Christmas and they have not turned yet  they are great gifts
3.0,"Very sad that &#34;ONE SIZE&#34; is too tight for me, 5'4&#34; 135lbs fit and round. Very cute design, thin material but not transparent."
3.0,the background is a sparkling gold fleck like.....I didn't care for that
3.0,Bag too small . Can only be used as a lunch bag . I wanted to use it as a beach bag but it is too small
3.0,"Cap was missing the Airborne shadow emblem on the right side and the word Airborne was not on the bill.  However, for my needs the Airborne emblem in the middle of the cap is fine.  I accept the cap as is."
3.0,"These are indeed very small and extremely painful for me to put in and take out. They do however look really nice, I can change them to match my outfit, and they are comfortable. They don't stick out and they don't fall out. Would recommend."
3.0,Large fit like a small medium....too tight for sure.
3.0,item was ok -- arrived on time and fit was fine
3.0,"The shirt is decent quality,  It runs large. Not a true Kelly green."
3.0,My husband likes it more than I do.  I guess that makes it OK.
3.0,"I own a couple of these suits, so I know that the production quality can vary from suit to suit. This particular suit was extremely tight in the rise. So tight that sitting was uncomfortable after 30 minutes or so.<br />I am 5‚Äô11‚Äù 185 and ordered a large. The coat fit perfectly and the waste was comfortable for me (I am a 34)."
3.0,Good for small people only
3.0,Well made and cute. I give it only 3 stars because it runs small and we only got to use the bonnet about 3 times before it was too small.
3.0,"This was a really good bracelet and it fit well/looked good, but the pearl that holds it together broke off after about 2 months of wearing it. I basically just tied it around my wrist to make it stay on. I would buy it again though, and just be more careful.<br />EDIT bought again and the same thing happened"
3.0,The bras are completely useless as a support bra - but comfortable as an everyday bra and they are pretty.
3.0,Followed the size guide but could barely push them into my size 10 Johnston & Murphy chukkas. So they were returned.
3.0,Cute but broke within a day /:
3.0,"Great for the price, but the hooks are plastic, so harder to clip on and not sure how long it will last."
3.0,Cute but small for a Large size equivalence.
3.0,The emblem that is iron on the front of the shirt is crooked it is not straight down with the shirt  Not centered
3.0,Good looking product. Band broke within 2 weeks. Refund given quickly.
3.0,One daisy on necklace damaged (yellow center and one petal were loose in box) Otherwise the set is very nice. I gave neutral rating pending seller‚Äôs response to my Email
3.0,Cute dress just a little too poofy for me. I‚Äôm 5 10 so the dress was a smidge short and the poofiness did nothing for me.
3.0,It was larger than what I expected. I had to made someone trim the legs part. But the material is decent and seems like it'll last a long time.
3.0,Alittle smaller than the size specified
3.0,I have a big head so I kind of expected it. I just cut the elastic off and wear it that way.
3.0,It was ok not exactly what I thought it was
3.0,It's an ok glasses. Would have been better if it was a bit larger. But it's cute
3.0,Like the tank tops but they are on the smaller side.  I should have got a size up from what I normally wear.
3.0,Much more of a pleated mask than smooth mask as pictured. Did come with a filter. Nose wire? Not so much. But I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I looked a long time for a case to hang from a purse so I don't have to be limited to buying purses with the right sixpence outside pocket.  This is very cute, girly, not boring.  I wouldn't trust outside pockets for important cards, but that isn't why I bought it.  Te straps are nice with swivel clips.  However, the small strap came improperly made, with it attached on,y to the clip part, not at the bottom with the swivel!  One clip on the long strap doesn't fully close unless you force it with your finger.  Great idea, poor execution."
3.0,"This is a beautiful, rolling laptop bag. However, the inside laptop space should be placed on the back side of the bag versus the front side of the bag. The bag tends to tilt and fall forward when the laptop is placed inside."
3.0,Nice shirt...Just order a size or two bigger.
3.0,"High quality, beautifully woven fabric, well made:  unfortunately still too scratchy for my wool-sensitive head.  Oh well, back to synthetics for me."
3.0,Not a tight fit. Slides a bit but expected with a case that is a slide in. Bought it to match the wristlet. Lots of compliments when paired together.  Couldn't find a discounted price for Sakroots anywhere
3.0,The blue colour is see through and the fabric doesn‚Äôt have any structure. Will be going back.
3.0,These are nice but a lot smaller than I expected.
3.0,Loved the print but after continued wear i wound up with a rash and had to go back to my silicone band.  Rash was super itchy and never had a reaction to a watch band before.  It went away when I changed bands.  I guess beware if you have sensitive skin.
3.0,"Not the correct size, had to take it in for it to fit."
3.0,"I measured myself and ordered according to the provided size chart.  The bottom portion fit me fine with plenty of fabric to wrap around so even in high winds I wouldn't expose myself.  The top prtion was way too big and just draped on me with not much shape.  I would definitely have to wear a tank top with this.  Due to the weird top I returned.  It might have fit if I sized down, but didn't want to take a chance on the top fitting weird."
3.0,"The top fit to size, but the bottoms were really tiny. I am at 34C and a size 4/6 in pants  so I ordered a large. The top fit, but it was not flattering and made my boobs look flat and pushed up at the same time. The bottoms didn't fit at all.  If the top had looked cute, I would've just kept the bottoms because the price is low enough, but neither of them looked good so I had to return. I would choose sizing on the piece (top or bottom) you like more because the other is probably not going to work."
3.0,The bracelet looks great and is as advertised. Beware however that you need to be a magician to put it on by yourself. Hooking the clasp together with one hand while trying to line the other end up is very frustrating.  Most days it stays in the dresser because you need 15 minutes and a lot of swearing just to get it on.
3.0,"They are pretty but they are not 6mm they are more like 5mm In fact  I bought different colors from the same company that states they are 7mm and they are about 5mm as well. No size difference at all, disappointed."
3.0,It looks way different on me than it does on the person pictured. The first length at the top does not drape it just clings to your chest looking weird. Just ugly...
3.0,"The sweater didn't fit as I expected but the seller, Beautife, was extremely cooperative and very pleasant to deal with on the return.  I would give them another try for purchases."
3.0,This case is advertized as &#34;extra large&#34; but it was too small to fit my standard large sunglasses. Had to return.
3.0,"These are nicely made and a good material but fit very small. I normally wear a large and ordered as such. These fit more like a small so I ended up giving them to a friend. They are good quality and a good deal, just order a size or two up."
3.0,"Good watch.  Does its job.  My only problem with it is how small it is.  I tried to figure out exact dimensions but no information was really given.  The watch, end to end is 9 inches.  I can get it to the first and second notch, but it looks kind of silly on my arm.  Fair warning for those with large wrists and large hands.  It will look a bit funny because it is so small.  I wore it with the watch on the underside of my wrist for when I needed to use it."
3.0,As expected of the quality of the jewelry. But it is a gift for my mother and it has pink ribbons on them that usually symbolize cancer support. It‚Äôs a bit distasteful to send them in a box that says ‚ÄúBurning Love‚Äù with hearts. It was strange I needed to put a sticker over the box to give it to my mother. I took of a few stars for that.
3.0,It‚Äôs a good bonnet. I just have a really small head. It won‚Äôt stay on.
3.0,Very pretty and fit nice but the fabric odor is unbearable. I‚Äôve washed them all several times and they still smell.
3.0,The measurements are off. Order the much larger size!
3.0,It had more compression than was comfortable for me. This could be a due to my own medical issues rather than a flaw with the socks. I only wore them for an hour before they became uncomfortably tight and I had to remove them. But the sellers were willing to off me a refund.
3.0,"It‚Äôs very cute, but I had to get help to put the band on my Fitbit versa 3.  Screwdriver, hinge, small parts included....but it was a lot of work for me to change out. I prefer the ones that just pop in or out."
3.0,The hat was ok but it is very boxy. Very square shaped hat and looked weird when I put it on and I wear a lot of hats.
3.0,"its ok, kind of baggy and the boob area was kinda loose on me. but ill make it work. took 2 months to arrive, almost forgot about it. 5'5 150lbs and ordered the medium. color is as pictured and love the silky stretchy material."
3.0,"I like the top, but so far, three buttons have fallen off."
3.0,The dress is ok. The top part is a bit loose for my taste. I'm a 34B
3.0,it took me for a while trying to figure it out how to use it.
3.0,Was cheeper material shorts don't look like picture but there are nice. The suspenders are horribly made! other than that it'll do.
3.0,"They would have been great, but really small.  I wonder is they are sized for women?  Two sizes too small."
3.0,Small hat would be ok for costume but not everyday
3.0,"I am a little apprehensive about the attachment to my Charge 3 as the ends seem light weight but so far have been fine. I love the aqua color and it is very comfortable against my wrist. However, It needs to come in a smaller size as I have it on the last hole and it is too loose.  The band wraps around my wrist making it a little bulky too."
3.0,They feel a little cheap. Not very soft.... they are hard & crunchy. I tried washing them thinking they would soften but it didn't help much.
3.0,"Very pretty. Wore it one day , lots of compliments. Still cold out so wore black leggings and boots. The ties are too thin and tassels fell off!!! The material came unstitched around the waist band where the tie string goes ... just cheaply made. Disappointed"
3.0,"Bonitos sus accesorios! Llego todo completo en su estuche! Sin embargo pens√© era de un material m√°s fuerte, el pl√°stico parece endeble! Tocar√° que mi hija lo use! Pero no creo dure mucho!"
3.0,I am in between a large and xl and the xl fit like a large. They fit like low riding jeans. Don't buy if you want high waisted. They are not. And you can feel the wais band seperate from the material they used. Very cheap feeling.
3.0,"Quality and design was as expected. Pants fit as expected, however, jacket was smaller than expected. Return is too bothersome so it will hang in closet until gifted or I loose weight but then the pants will be too big. Lol"
3.0,"I am happy about the quality of this product, but the size is odd. I ordered a large to accommodate my D bustline but there is very little ‚Äúshelf‚Äù built into this cami!"
3.0,To bling didn‚Äôt realize they were so shinny and to much money for a toddler shoe very disappointing
3.0,"Nice pants , fit well ."
3.0,"I am 5'10"" and normally wear size 8/10 M.  I purchased size 10 and it fit as expected.  The fabric is on the thin side but it is not clingy at all.  Overall, pleasantly surprised and better than expected."
3.0,"I've been looking for a VU t-shirt with an oversized banana for months and finally ran across this one; it was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />However, the material is pretty cheap and the shirt is simply too long. I have a relatively long torso and it looks like a blouse on me."
3.0,"A cute, very light earring.  Good for wearing all day or for casual occasions.  The finish is good.  Marked down some because posts bend easily and the backings are plastic.  Doubt they will last a long time but they are attractive as long as they last."
3.0,Cute shirt buts runs really small.
3.0,"The charm I think is the only part of this bracelet that's stainless. The bracelet itself was not,  it started turning colors within first week of wear."
3.0,"I am 5‚Äô7, 135 pounds. I don‚Äôt consider myself to have large thighs. However, these were entirely too tight. They left marks on my legs and I couldn‚Äôt keep them from rolling up instead of having the wide hem at the top.<br /><br />I ordered these because they were a good price and I do like the patterns, hence the 3 stars. I just won‚Äôt be able to wear them."
3.0,When wearing loafers the heel part of the sock keeps slipping off after walking for a few minutes. There's a rubber reinforcement in the heel area but doesn't seem to help much
3.0,"They fit great and are light weight. However, they started to fall apart after 6 months of regular use of walking 5 to 10 miles a day."
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt fit that good a little larger then the size
3.0,"They smell terrible out of the package - DO NOT WASH WITH ANY OTHER LAUNDRY.  I ended up washing the socks 3 times with vinegar and laundry soap, just to get the horrible chemical smell out of the socks."
3.0,Ordered according to the measurements however the arms were too tight.
3.0,not bad when you have a large fam for traveling
3.0,One of the eyelets fell out after a month.
3.0,Kind if flimsy.  They are cute and I would recommend.
3.0,Looks great.....lots of compliments..but the band has a crease it in that I have not been able to flatten out.
3.0,I didn't care for this one
3.0,the butter fly fell inside the first month.
3.0,Unfortunately this bathing suit was too small. I read the other reviews and ordered one size up. The bottom fit perfect but the cut of the top was too small. I have a larger chest so I wasn't surprised that it didn't fit because I am used to it. I am a size 32 DD in bras and usually a 4 in pants. Anyway the suit was super cute and felt like it was made out of quality materials. The color was true to the picture. I would have ordered a large but the bottoms would have been too big. That is why I am giving it 3 stars. It would have been perfect if you could order the top and bottom separately.  I got the red one and it was very beautiful. Too bad it didn't work out for me. I also likes that you can adjust the straps so you can get a batter fit.  Note: I received this product at a discount in return for my honest unbiased review.
3.0,It's a rain bonnet what else can I say.  it was for someone else.
3.0,Not bad but does look very much like a child‚Äôs play toy
3.0,"These glasses were made in Malaysia.  I couldn't disagree more with the existing 5 star reviewers.  They are ill fitting to begin with.  The nose guard is bendable to better fit the nose, which is a necessary feature to better align the lenses with the eyes and keep them from slipping.  They are not comfortable by any means.  They are adjustable and this is a good feature, but if there are any bright lights in the room there are many internal reflections.  At best, their field of view is very limited.  You have the feeling that you are peering down a pipe for the clearest view."
3.0,"it was flimsier than I imagined. the strap is skinnier that it looks and there is not much tension. the clips where you hang the purse are small to medium sized so if you have a purse with wider (1"" or more) or thicker (leather ones for example) you may have trouble hanging both straps on the clip. it can slide down as well. don't know if I would purchase again - probably not."
3.0,"Not the best. Could easily be at target for more. Its like a stretchy material, but it runs really small. The arm lenght doesnt match the torso sizing. But its good for the price"
3.0,"After washing per directions, the shirts came out WAY to small, not even worn, caution while shopping!"
3.0,"I ordered this in apricot for myself and just LOVE IT!! The reviews said it could be smelly but it wasn't at all. Beautiful purse and no odor at all. So I ordered one for my sister in the light gray and it smelled just awful. Not to mention that the light gray color was actually a light brown. Not a bad color, but not what i wanted. I am sending it back but in the meantime i ordered another apricot one for my sister and it has arrived and is just as nice (and non-smelly) as mine.Maybe just the smell of the dye? Just be careful which one you order!!"
3.0,"I really like the look of this purse, it is a nice design with good space. However, it smells horrible! I saw some posts about this in the reviews, and others that said it didn't have a odor, so I took my chances...Nothing has worked so far, so it is sitting in my basement, covered in essential oils and still reeling of fish :("
3.0,The front screws on and can pinch your earlobe. Will be uncomfortable at all times.
3.0,We bought this for our 10 year old girl and we even went up in size and would up with a sweater that is almost too small. She won't be able to wear this for more than a year. Also the graphics weren't as clear as we'd have liked
3.0,I would have loved these but they run very small so I can't give me much of a review because I couldn't get it past my thighs.  Overall I think they would have worked had I been able to get them up and actually wear them.  I was very disappointed that I couldn't wear them at all.
3.0,"After reading the reviews, I thought this item would work for my wife.  However it fits smaller than expected.  She can use them, but not sure if that will still be the case once they are washed."
3.0,The front straps that go from them cup to the shoulder strap are very loose. However the rest of the bra is a perfect fit and very comfortable. I'll probably just cut the loose straps off because I like everything else about it.
3.0,"These glasses are well made and sturdy. However, the center horizontal bar on the picture appears gold, but in reality is a sharp off-white color. It is too harsh for the design, which makes them look less attractive."
3.0,The fabric could have been better.
3.0,Color wasn‚Äôt as advertised.  Dull and can barely see picture and writing.
3.0,"This was a good necklace for the price, pretty good quality and looked better than others I bought from other places."
3.0,"I thought the purse would look better than what it does in this color, but it will do."
3.0,"If you like the old style non-shiny velour, then this will NOT be what you want. It‚Äôs an okay shirt and decent price, well made, BUT it‚Äôs the shiny poly kind of velour rather than the soft cotton kind. Just FYI."
3.0,These are cute and the kids love them but one broke already that is why I gave one star to th stretch.
3.0,"I love the top of the swimsuit so much, in fact it was the only reason I bought this swimsuit. It fits great (size up if you would be close to between sizes). But the bottoms are made for a doll, I am a size 0 and 5'4&#34; and the medium bottoms were laughably small. Won't be returning because i love the top so much though. Top gets 5 stars, bottoms 1 star."
3.0,"I like the sweater. It kind of feels like a thin thermal material. I got the gray and it is not see through. The sleeves are long, which is nice because I have really long arms. The seams are a little ruched like it was pulled through a sewing machine too fast, but it's not a big deal. It isn't high quality but cute and cozy. My problem with it is that there is writing (end of the fabric roll?) On the underside of the material that shows through the front like a stain. I contacted the seller to see if maybe it would wash out - I like it and didn't want to bother with an exchange - but their only response was for me to contact Amazon and have them handle it. I don't know. I feel like the seller could have tried to answer the question."
3.0,Doesn't look much like the picture unless you squint and try not to see any detail. Basically a long t-shirt. The sleeves are tight and not at all like the picture. Still kind of cute. And not a waste for the price. I gave it to a friend because I am too large chested for this.
3.0,"It's a cheap watch so can expect too much,..it looks pretty ok but taking links out to resize was impossible. It ended up broken before wearing while trying to fit it."
3.0,The magnet works but hurts!
3.0,"I wanted to love this swimsuit, but the top was WAY too small and did not seem at all consistent with the size of the bottom. I'm 5&#34;4', 34D bra, 26&#34; waist, and 40&#34; hips. I ordered this in XL based on the other reviewers' comments and the size chart in the description. The bottom fit fine, but the top was so tight that it was both uncomfortable and unattractive. I had to return, but I'm sure this would look cute on someone with different proportions."
3.0,I‚Äôm bummed because I would‚Äôve ordered one size up if the reviews had indicated it runs a size small.
3.0,Product seems nice by feel and look but I haven't tried it on I will be returning it because it's too big
3.0,Large would have been perfect
3.0,It is beautiful but the size is big!
3.0,My teenage granddaughter requested this shirt in a size S.  The description does say to order a size down.  Unfortunately there was no XS.  I figured often teens like to wear things a bit oversized'.  When this arrived it was so large my  husband was able to wear it with room to spare (he is normally a men's M/L).  Had to return.
3.0,Can't wear over glasses
3.0,"First of all, please order double sizes up because it's really really small. I normally wear size M or L and I got it size XXL. Well, it's fit ok. The straps are a little short and under arms are a little bit tight. Length is good for lounging and I can wear it all day on lazy weekend. The color and style is cute, but fabric is not that good.<br />Overall is ok, for the price point is a little high for quality."
3.0,"Let's start with the good, the material is soft, and the pattern is great. The bad is that it is waaaay too long. My baby is always in the highest percentile of height but this was still too long. Frustrating."
3.0,"There‚Äôs plenty to like, but the part where the arm is attached relies on a narrow piece of the solid hard plastic frame. The pictures explain that much better! These do look good they have some venting and that black soft piece attached at the bridge is  so helpful for sweating. I have one on my custom Smith fishing glasses and they have kept my glasses off my face for extra venting. One more thing, some kids don‚Äôt fit these wrap around glasses until they get older. I would try some at a shop just to make sure. Bottom line, the look good, have some venting, but I think they will break fairly quickly. I would buy them if my kids had wanted them if the price was low enough I didn‚Äôt mind the risk."
3.0,"The canvas material on the outside and the space inside are exactly what I expected and wanted. But the quality of the stitching, on the handles and the inside zipper pocket, are not what I expected. A little more than a month of using this purse on a daily basis with the same amount of items as I carried in my last canvas purse and the seams have already come apart in the zipper pocket. I sewed it together only for the stitching for the zipper of that pocket to come undone. The handles are unraveling little by little, and it probably won't be long before they're completely undone as well."
3.0,"Ended up returning this because I bought the wrong size. Didn't read the top very carefully, it's for the PLUS. Thanks!"
3.0,"The fit is ok, but the support is less than ideal for the &#34;no-bounce full support&#34; it claims to provide. I would not recommend this for running or any kind of intense sport. But, it is ok for walking and other low intensity, mild activities."
3.0,They were longer than i thought
3.0,I ordered a medium and the fit was good. The material is not of the best quality.
3.0,The socks are nice looking and easy to get on and off.  But I just don't think that they are 20-30 mmHg.<br />They feel too loose.
3.0,Fits a little small and feels pretty cheap. Quality is equivalent to other $15 tops that I have. The fit is a little weird and I wish I had sized up.
3.0,They have fooled me again. I am previously bought compression socks from these people based on the promise they were easy to put on and easy to take off. They were not. I saw an ad recently for this product making the same claim. I figured that maybe they had improved them. They have not. They are not at all easy to put on an easy to take off
3.0,"its nice a little see through but my husband liked it  , the only thing is that its a little small im 165 pds 5'8 and it keeps riding up"
3.0,Still haven't worn it in though
3.0,"Really love the look of this purse and it holds everything that I need while still maintaining its shape! However, the second day I used it the strap broke on it :( really sad about it. I used to love Scarleton bags but I've had poor luck with the last two I have purchased."
3.0,"Eh, not the most elegant pieces but cute."
3.0,"I bought two pairs cause they were on sale for a good price only to find out they did not fit me, they run about a size smaller. üò≠"
3.0,It came slightly cracked.
3.0,This item didn't stick to me
3.0,Smaller then I expected but cute
3.0,"Okay, I guess. Somewhat flimsy. Not thrilled. I guess they're okay for what they're worth. Probably just a spare set of driving glasses that I don't need to worry about too much."
3.0,Shorts great Shirt a lil small for a xxl
3.0,"I purchased this shirt with the intent of going for a baggy silky shirt look. I normally wear a small, but I ordered a medium. However, once I tried the shirt on the medium fit like a small."
3.0,"You definitely have to size up because the arms and length is slightly off. I'm usually a xsmall or small, but I like some of my hoodies to be slim fitting and I sized up and got a medium because of all the reviews. This hoodie doesn't give you the slim fit it's more of a comfort/ loose fit because you need to size up. I think if I sized down it would be too tight  to get into since the fabric is not all that stretchy. Everywhere else it fits fine. The shoulder seam falls lower than my shoulder and the length of the overall sweater is just perfect and sits just slightly lower than my hips. If I sized down I think it'd be too tight and too short. The fleece on the inside is nice and soft. Not sure how it will be after I wash it several times.  I think the sweater is slightly too thin and feels kind of cheap, but it beats buying a sweater like this for over $60. This one I can just wear for awhile and once I'm sick of the style I can just donate or recycle."
3.0,"I thought these were kinda flimsy , was expecting better quality for the price"
3.0,"UPDATED REVIEW: So I‚Äôve been wearing the band for a long time now and at first I was and am still let down that the nice suede color and feel left. However, the new color that has emerged is nice too. It‚Äôs just a lot darker. I still get compliments on it and now I don‚Äôt have to be as careful with it. Since I wear it almost all the time, it has started to stink. I‚Äôve soaked it in baking soda and water and then let it dry out in the sun and it‚Äôs helped but I think it‚Äôs time to just buy another one. At $15, that‚Äôs not a big deal and it has lasted a long time. Also, just be aware that you need to make sure that the tiny screws on the part that slide into the watch need to be tightened every once in a while.<br /><br />As other reviews have stated, gets dingy within two days of wearing it. I was extremely cautious with it and it made no difference. It‚Äôs made out of a suede type leather so it‚Äôs somewhat understandable but still. Not to mention the thread came undone by the third day. I mean it‚Äôs not a $40 band but I expected a little more out of it. Sucks to because it looked great the first day."
3.0,little cheaper looking than I had expected...
3.0,I didnt like the plastic adjustable strap. Preferred velcro strap. Too nice of a hat to have a cheap looking plastic strap on the back.
3.0,"Nice material, good stretch, just not doable for us. The opening at the ankles was so disproportionately small that my teen son could not fit the pant leg over his heel when putting these on.  I suppose they would be fine if the wearer has munchkin feet, but my size-11 footed male could not get these on without a struggle.  Once he finally did manage to squeeze his foot through the opening, the pants fit like a super duper skinny leg would fit, and they looked nice.  The ankle struggle is just not going to work for us, but may work for you."
3.0,The ring is very pretty.... HOWEVER wore it 2 times and it bent.  The ring metal is VERY VERY soft
3.0,"I like the glass and the correction is has for my sight.  The width of the frame is a bit snug for my head.  However, with time, they loosen up a bit and the fit is acceptable."
3.0,"Very cute, ripped after two wears."
3.0,To smal but good quality!!
3.0,"Nice product worked well for a family trip to Disney.  My daughter where's a 7 in most items and this fit her well.  It was a tad snug through the stomach, but not uncomfortably so.  The one issue she had was the neck was a bit tight and she felt like it was choking her."
3.0,"My teenage Daughter is going through a bit of an emo phase eight now, so she asked me for this accessory. It was cheap, so I bought it for her, and she seems very happy with it, and says it's &#34;lit&#34;."
3.0,"Design and fabric are great. I wanted it to be a slouchy fit but this runs really big! I'm keeping it but I do wish it was tapered back a bit on the sizing. Had I known, I'd have ordered a smaller size. I washed it and put it in the dryer. It didn't shrink so if you're ordering it, size down!"
3.0,I followed the size chart but this jacket looks smallish to me. Mainly because the sleeves look short. I will know for sure after Xmas as I bought this as a gift.
3.0,I ordered the black Isotoner gloves and ended up with Ivory gloves.  The gloves seem warm and look nice enough for the price . The fingers seem abnormally long and wide towards the tip of the fingers .
3.0,I Really like the shirt because it matches the leggings that I have with the price was way too high
3.0,These are very cheaply made sunglasses. They scratch and bend very easily.
3.0,And it not really big /large. More if your going somewhere and don‚Äôt want to take your big purses. Then grab this stylish
3.0,It‚Äôs cute enough but the piece should be bigger so it won‚Äôt spin around And sit backwards so much.
3.0,I really fell in love with these silicone rings due to the fact that they had different colors but my husband‚Äòs been wearing the black over the red  for about three weeks and this is the color the whole entire black stripped off and now it‚Äôs faded red I guess you could still use it for work
3.0,Product fits true to size.  Chunks of the insert (green) start breaking off within a week.
3.0,very small purse but good materal
3.0,"I ordered a larger size than I normally wear and it shrunk a lot.  Otherwise, it's very nice."
3.0,The ring was super cute! And comfy to wear and adjust.. however after awhile it started to change color on the ring. I would still buy another because it is so cute but the color change is a downfall.
3.0,Had to send back. I got a large based on reviews. I'm 5'7 and 138 and the body was plenty big but I had to contort myself to get my arms in and then I felt like I couldn't move.
3.0,No child sizes were offered.
3.0,These are really cute and seem well made but I didn‚Äôt realize they were wide. My 14 month olds foot was sliding constantly in the shoe even with a thicker sock. She is a steady walker and fell multiple times trying to walk. If your child‚Äôs foot is more narrow then don‚Äôt buy these.
3.0,but the color in the skirt faded a bit after a few washings.
3.0,love this bracelet only wore a few times and starting to fade but overall it nice
3.0,"The magnifier patch is to high and can be see when looking straight ahead.  A bit of a distraction when driving, biking or walking but not too bad when stationary."
3.0,The bra is ridiculously large.
3.0,"This bra worked well for a backless dress I wore while on vacation. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because I am not too sure if it truly will be reusable. The adhesive doesn't work as well after the first use. I will probably try to use it again at home, to test it to see if it really can be considered reusable. On the other hand, it did work well for the one time I used it. I am a big C cup borderline D cup and it worked well for me. It kept everything together and it made my dress look very nice. Overall, it is a good product if you don't intend to purchase for constant use. I did purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"Great, affordable set of plugs!<br />Unfortunately one came broken but overall they're all good quality.<br />It would be great to get the single plug replaced if possible (I don't have the option to request it though, just the option to return them all)"
3.0,ACCURATELY MADE
3.0,Very cheap and  thin. But for thd price I guess I couldn't expect anything too great. They were as pictured online and came quick.
3.0,"They are cute and warm.  However, for the money, I thought these would have been really super cozy.  I dont think they are any better than the pair I picked up at the dollar store.  Would not repurchase."
3.0,"It was nice to have 3 different choices in one purchase.  The ""teeth"" on the clips are very rough which can snag ties if not careful.  I filed down the teeth a little with some fine sandpaper to smooth them out.  Hopefully it will work.  Cannot attest to the durability of the clips since it was a gift.  Time will tell."
3.0,Too big for pandora
3.0,"Super cute, but not long enough."
3.0,The dress does not look like the picture. The top of the dress is straight and not tapered which makes it look like something a toddler would wear. I wish it had a sash to tie in the back. I will be returning the dress.
3.0,super tiny but still super pretty
3.0,Love KISS... LOVE the idea of amp plugs...but the KISS sign does rub off ... Or id give it 5 stars
3.0,Used for part of a Halloween costume. Served it‚Äôs purpose. Great price for costume jewelry.
3.0,The pic of makes it look like a cool design nut it is just vertical B&W STRIPES.
3.0,"Not happy with the coloring will probably return, there are bright yellow threads in it that do not color match at all and stand out too much"
3.0,Protejer wl smart watche
3.0,"I am very mixed on this item.  I ordered it to use while doing commercial cleaning and also for employees to use while commercial cleaning.  While it would definitely do the job, there are a few things I would fix about it.  First, the adjustable belt strap is ""slippery""-- as in, the adjustable plastic piece doesn't stay put very well.  Definitely still functionable.  I don't think it's going to fall off while in use but could get looser after time when it is full of supplies.  Secondly, at time of order, this item was retailing for $19.99.  As mentioned, I considered buying these for my team of commercial cleaners but at this price, I do not think it is a good deal.  I think I can get a better value in another product.<br />I do like the easily-removable keychains on the apron.  The actual apron pouch seems to be made of good material."
3.0,Thicker than expected
3.0,Ok product but would not stay in shape.
3.0,"The shirt is great and fits good, except for the collar. It has too much space."
3.0,"I got these because I thought they would be easier to put in and take out. They are very difficult to get back out of your piercings once u put them in. I used them for my Tragus, rook and cartilage piercings and I will never used them again, the colors are a coating that peels off. I have really sensitive skin, an I can‚Äôt wear anything with nickel, or sterling silver. What ever is under the coating I am allergic to. I have had these piercings for years, an I had to take them out because they got infected."
3.0,It was both to small and to big. The top was big and the bottom was to small.
3.0,"Really pretty, and good quality.  Not big enough for large wrists good for 7&#34; or less."
3.0,Seems to have been stretched out by someone already. I usually fare good witH Xls but this was different. Too big at the top and too tight in the body. Im 38-33-45@5'10
3.0,"I couldn't get them on my husbands feet,hoping we can get the swelling down so they will fit."
3.0,Very tight at back of the knee
3.0,"The packaging was a little suspect as they were shipped in a normal bubble envelope, but it ended up being very safe in the included hard-ish shell case.  The case also had a repair tool, a protective bag, and cleaning cloth.  The glasses look good, but my wife is adjusting to the bluish tint they have when looked through. I suppose that's the effect of either the color of the lenses or the polarization.  They do not feel as sturdy as other cheap aviators we've had, but time will tell how durable these are."
3.0,The slip that comes with is of no use. Is just as transparente as the dress and is much smaller than the dress; it did not fit. I owned a proper slip prior to this purchase that went well with the dress. I loved the dress. It hid and huged in all the right places.
3.0,They are cotton sox might be better if had a little lycra (stretchy material) in them.
3.0,It's not standardized
3.0,"For reference, I am 5'7, 135 lb with a pretty average body shape, 34C. This dress was cute but waaay too short! When I tried it on you could see about half of my butt. This would probably be way better on someone shorter but if you are around my height DON'T buy it your whole booty is gonna be out. I'd say probably if your shorter than 5'4- 5'5 then you can go for it and try it, but any taller than that... it's just not gonna work  out. Also the fabric feels like an athletic shirt type of material or even swimsuit fyi"
3.0,Not the greatest material but you get what you pay for ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3.0,I was expecting two separate necklaces but it is really just two chains on a single clasp. Construction was fine and for the price this piece is great. I haven't worn it long enough to see if it turns me green though ü§£
3.0,"These hairnets are durable, however, a bit small. If you have a smaller size head they would be great.  Unfortunately, average to large or more hair than my short cut would be difficult"
3.0,"Looks better in the picture then it does on. Didn't send it back,so will probably wear it this summer."
3.0,"The bracelet is really cute and fun looking, but not a durable I would have hoped.  My daughter loved it, very trendy"
3.0,Could have bought a better earring at the dollar store for a buck. I was disappointed
3.0,Bigger
3.0,"Wife bought these; she says (3) stars for the following reason: not as soft a cotton as she would have liked... But, other than that, quite adequate!"
3.0,"I have a fairly big head.  This hat does not stretch, so it is too uncomfortable to wear.  Can you say HAT HEAD?  Once it IS on my head, there's lots of hat left sitting up in a poof on my head.  Anyway, the quality of the FUR and the stitching is not too good.  I am returning it."
3.0,A bit large for a females head but otherwise good.
3.0,"I loved this band and how it looked. However, I wore it one time in the pool and all the flowers began peeling off."
3.0,"It felt good, it was just too long for me."
3.0,"Overall this product does not look as pictured. It was cheaply made with uneven stitching. Order a couple of sizes up from what you would usually wear. I ordered a medium despite normally wearing a small and found it difficult to zip around the rib cage. The chest was baggy, but the outer layer was far to small and will need to be adjusted. The gloves that come with the costume just had the tips cut off and were uneven and not sewn off. You will either need new gloves or to cut these ones more to maintain character accuracy. The only detail on the costume that is actually 3D is a symbol at the bottom of the dress. Everything else is part of the fabric design. It's a decent cosplay, but you could probably find something better for the price."
3.0,Beautiful but the hearts are quite painful; get caught on bras
3.0,I like it even though its a little bit big for meüòâ
3.0,"I absolutely adore this dress. BUT, could never wear it outside my bedroom. I'm 5'10&#34;, 150lbs. Ordered a Medium AND MY CROTCH IS CONSTANTLY IN VIEW. I guess I'm just too tall. Or I'd literally have to have one hand holding down the front at all times... Besides crotch issue it fit me perfectly everywhere else."
3.0,Absolutely LOVE the black. However when purchased the beige they arrived and are white and completely see through. Also ordered same size as other pair and this one didn't fit. Returned.
3.0,It was way too small for my granddaughter but my great-niece could wear it. It's an adorable little maxi...
3.0,"Not as nice as they look in the picture and they are a lot bigger than they look, they are over priced, should be sold for a dollar! They look cheap."
3.0,"Ordered yellow, got red.  Photos show a timer function (4/8/12 hrs).  There isn't one.  They get warm in one small spot, the rest of the unit stays cool."
3.0,"I like the blouse however it's not as shown.  The lace is emerald green but the blouse itself is olive green.  I bought this for St. Patrick's Day so I'm  bit disappointed.  Also the packaging on this was terrible.  It came in a cellophane bag that wasn't even sealed closed.  The blouse itself was rolled up and tossed into this bag.  By the time I got it, it was half out of the bag and very, very wrinkled."
3.0,"The item works, but this listing is for only a single cleaner, not a case of 24 like the description says."
3.0,I have had this for some time now and have worn it about 15 times and it already has a hole developing in it right in the middle of the chest.  I think I may have just got a poor quality this time because My other hoodies from this brand are all OK.
3.0,"Love the print and I always got compliments,. But little tight."
3.0,"Returning item.  I ordered the XL (I'm 6'4&#34; 210lbs, athletic build, normally and XL top and L bottom).  I was able to squeeze into this top but it was too tight around my chest and arms.  If you your chest is 45&#34; or larger and arms over 15&#34; (both relaxed) then you might try XXL?  Quality/material/stitching had no issues."
3.0,"The weight of this watch I love, however you have to make the band a snug fit otherwise it hurts your wrist as it moves because it's so heavy."
3.0,A little feminine looking but that's offset by the large dial face.Watchband hard to use. Overall a good buy.
3.0,Very stylish lightweight affordable but prescription on the glasses very very low did not help me see better
3.0,Meh. Gotta watch Amazon purchases for sizing. If it's Asian sizing and not well stated as such (and a great many aren't) you get clothes for a child. LOOK CAREFULLY.
3.0,"I bought this top as a base layer for winter cycling in Colorado.  It works very well for that except the cut of the neck is not comfortable.  It is too loose for a mock neck shirt and the front taper causes it not to lay flat when fully zipped or left slightly open.  I'll still use this for cycling in cold weather (don't need the style points), but won't order another one nor wear it for casual dress.  Disappointing item because of the cut and style of the mock neck."
3.0,Fits true to size but I wasn‚Äôt fond of the overall cut of the dress... looked like I was hiding a baby bump. The material is also VERY thick.
3.0,Needs more arch support and cushioning.
3.0,One of the lava beads came broken and dont really like how the extra string dangles so much
3.0,Needs to be a bit wider for the war lobe.
3.0,The belt was not included with my dress. I‚Äôm not happy
3.0,Dress is well made I wasn't expecting all of the elastic gathering on both sides of the dress but it's a cute summer dress.
3.0,"The slippers were too tight on the sides but once you wear them enough, it fits a little better. Also, the slipper tends to make your feet sweat after a while."
3.0,They are barely rose colored at all. When I wear them with any other gold earring you cannot tell any difference at all.
3.0,Ok but completely flat on one side.  Not as expected.
3.0,"I love this little wallet. It connects directly to your keychain (no extra chain or strap that could potentially break), which is why I bought it. It is small and compact, so overall it is very practical. While I am glad that I made this purchase, I noticed after 1 day of use and opening the wallet less than 5 times total, that the lining had already cracked on both sides. I tried to show examples of this in photos 2 and 3. This isn‚Äôt a huge deal to me because I still like the wallet and am not returning it, but I did expect it to hold up better than this. I‚Äôm not sure what the propose of adding the lining was if it breaks that quickly. I have also not had issues with my cards slipping out, so I do think it holds cards in place well. However, I have no put a card in the outer stretchy fabric pocket."
3.0,"Comfortable shirts, but kind of a weird material, almost slippery? Static clings a little bit to the stomach even though it‚Äôs summer. Loved the colors (I got pink, maroon, and brown). The strap in the back is a little scratchy, but not bad at all. Overall, I liked the product but probably won‚Äôt rave about it or hurry out to buy another set"
3.0,These run a little big
3.0,"A little tight around the top of the leg, but otherwise a really nice padded sock, fits foot fine."
3.0,"They fit pretty good, except after wearing them a couple of times the waist stretched a bit, I had to improvise the waist a bit to make them comfortable."
3.0,"I love the color and this is exactly what I was looking for, but in some places the blue is scratched off leaving white/light blue marks, which is kind of disappointing."
3.0,"I do like the garment, but had to return it since it's too small. I bought a medium and I'm typically a small or medium. Bust 36&#34;, waist 31&#34;, hips 37&#34;. It was just a little too snug in the waist and bust. The fabric is also different than I expected. It has a waffle pattern/texture similar to thermal undergarment fabric. I am considering ordering one size larger but haven't decided yet. It is a cute top (or dress if you're short) and does look like the picture."
3.0,"If I had seen this in a store, I would not have bought it.  I did not realize that it is artwork (which is very nice) enclosed in a clear vinyl covering.  I'm not sure how it will hold up over time.  My main problem with it is that the part that you put between the checks when writing out the duplicate checks is not really long enough.  Therefore, it does not cover the date area.  If you press too hard, the date will come out on the duplicate check for the following check.  So, I have to make sure you can read the date on the duplicate check.  But, it does serve its purpose, the design is attractive (and it is 3 dimensional), so I decided to keep it."
3.0,They are not formed to fit my face.. The wind still blows into my eyes. regular sunglasses would work just the same
3.0,"These fit my kids well and I like the colors, BUT it only took a few days for the seams to come undone."
3.0,It's cute. Nice piece of jewelry.
3.0,Swim suit is very cute but for my body top part was lil small
3.0,"Didn't fit as expected. I ordered a small because of the measurements and it was still a bit big and much longer than expected as well. But the quality is good, I will just get it altered a bit."
3.0,Fabric=super static
3.0,The bar code sticker is wrong-- labeled at grey but it's actually pink. It's also moisture wicking and quick drying -- not actually for cold weather like I was expecting.
3.0,The gem got removed but it was mostly my fault. Don't shower while wearing them.
3.0,"Far too see through to be a viable option. The cut of the dress is cute and in a different color it might be more forgiving, however I ordered it in white."
3.0,"The &#34;one size fits all&#34; is a bit big on me - I'm 5'2&#34;, 110lbs, and usually wear an XS or S. I would say that this &#34;one size fits all&#34; would be a better size for someone who wears a M or L. But it's not so big that it does not fit and would still function as a beach cover up. The scrunched part in the front under the bust isn't tight on me but at least gives it a little more shape. It's a little long but not past my knees. I am not sure if I'm going to keep it or return it yet."
3.0,The material for this dress is lighter than expected. It would be great for summer but I wouldn‚Äôt wear in fall or winter. Colors are vibrant and it washes well. The straps are just slightly wider set than my bra straps so I have to keep tucking the strap in on the front on just one side which is annoying. It‚Äôs best with a strapless bra. Otherwise the fit is flattering.
3.0,This was an OK bracelet for the money however the chakra colors red and orange are not exactly accurate as they are both red. Also the clear beads on the opposite side are extremely annoying and get in the way. Adjusting the bracelet while on is very difficult
3.0,I had to quit using this band because it will not stay closed and I was afraid of losing my watch.
3.0,"I am 5'3"" and 125 lbs, purchased this dress in medium size, turned out to be huge. I returned it, but if I was gonna buy it again, I would probably need either small or extrasmall size. The length though was just at an ankle. I am assuming in small size it would be even shorter, so no alterations would have been necessary."
3.0,I am 5'4 125lbs and I ordered a medium. Theyre cute but way too big and unfortunately I am outside of the window to exchange.
3.0,A little thinner than I thought but a very delicate lady like chain.
3.0,Good for larger head.
3.0,"So, I love, and hate this dress... this is adorable, the material feels nice, and my daughter loves it.  However, the decals on the dress, make it just cheap. Each time I've washed it, the more comes off it.. so eventually, this will not look nice anymore"
3.0,The breast part feels like it can slip and the bottom part was saggy
3.0,Very small for size the XL was more like a Medium and the Ferrari Logo was not embroidered.
3.0,"I have yet to give this item to my son, but I am sure that he will be thrilled to receive it once I do.  My only gripe is that the material is sssoooooo cheap and very clearly will not last through much wear or many washings.  I would have been very happy to pay more for a higher quality product as opposed to less for something that is pretty much cosplay only (and even then, obviously very cheap)... Overall I would say dont expect much and you will be happy."
3.0,"This shirt is cute but fits odd. It's short lengthwise (I am 5'3"" and it barely tucks into high-waisted shorts) the armpit area is too big. There is no way to adjust the gathering at the neck and tie in back is way too long."
3.0,Smaller
3.0,I thought this would have been larger overall but it‚Äôs not. Nothing wrong with it just not the size I was looking for.
3.0,Pretty color and necklace
3.0,These didnt really work well as a mask alternative because the material  was a bit suffocating and it would slip. But in a pinch it would work - maybe you hold it in place.
3.0,Medium is like a large
3.0,Nice cubes but the color is nothing like pictured. Ordered 3 different colors and all were very different in person. The pink is not light baby pink but instead a bright pink and the navy is just like blue not dark navy blue.
3.0,They were great until they came apart about 1 year after purchasing.
3.0,"I really liked the dress, it fit me perfectly! I ordered a small and I am 5'4"" 124lbs 34B.  I got compliments and all but unfortunately the material or what they used to stitch the dress around the waist with made my skin itch! I wore it for a few hours and I was uncomfortable scratching at my sides almost the whole time.  I don't have sensitive skin but it was scratchy.  I saw someone else say that in a review and i was hoping I wouldn't find that same issue but I did.  I requested a return which is unfortunate because again, I  liked it but I'm not going to be uncomfortable all day because I want to look pretty, I can find something else more comfy on my skin...I'm not a runway model! lol"
3.0,"These are perfect for that 90‚Äôs look, but they are tiny.  Size up at least 2 sizes."
3.0,"I bought a 2T for my daughter, but it was definitely smaller than a 2T which was disappointing because she only got a couple wears out of it."
3.0,Very good movie yhat i would watch over and over
3.0,"Cute, inexpensive but don't plan to wear for any length of time"
3.0,"I would rate these socks as average. They are a thicker sock and are comfortable enough. My biggest complaint is that they take significantly longer to dry than expected. If they are bunched up at all, they will come out of the dryer very damp. I have had them about 9 months and a few of them have gotten holes in them.  They are comfortable, and overall I have liked them, but they don't seem to be worth the premium price."
3.0,A decent shoe that I use for work around the house. The shoe runs about a half a size too big.
3.0,Its really cute but runs BIG and is more of a thin poleyester type material- not regular swimsuit material.<br />Got it to match my adult size and it will be cute for photos!
3.0,"Love this but had to return because it was too big!!! I used the size chart posted with it and decided to go for an XXL because I am a size 12, 180lbs and the size chart said a large was a size 8. I put it on and was swimming in it!! Material is stretchy and loose fitting already. I would have been just fine getting a large"
3.0,"The next time someone tells me ""one size fits all"" and makes hats for children, I'm going to cry. Gave to my gf."
3.0,Liked the shirt but doesnt fit very well ordered a large like the other ones ive ordered from here but it was a bit small.
3.0,I wear these a lot and they're super cute and comfy! Just not very sturdy. The metal part of the frame tends to unscrew itself from the hinge quite often. Had to purchase a glasses repair kit so that I can constantly fix them.
3.0,"These are an awesome design. They run big, especially on the from. My child‚Äôs foot get halfway out from the front. Definitely not the best for thin feet."
3.0,They were a lot smaller than I expected.
3.0,"This dress is really cute, but I went by the size chart and the dress came and it was really, really too big. It's also really stretchy material, so I needed to get 2 sizes smaller.  I might have been able to get it 3 sizes smaller (it was really big and the fabric is very stretchy). I bought this for a costume for a play, and wasn't able to use it. It is really adorable, though, so I hope I have an actress I can put it on someday. The color is really nice and rich."
3.0,This runs really large. I got the 18-24 month for my todder who wears 18 mo and he was swimming in it. I get the two smaller sized to find a better fit. i will update when I get the new ones.
3.0,"The bag is fine but the straps are coming apart.  I had to cut some for the strap edges to keep it tidy looking.  If you carry lots of items, you would need a bigger bag.  I wish it had one zip to enclose the entire bag."
3.0,Came in musty smelling had to wash before wearing.  Other than fine
3.0,I think we send this back because it looked too much like a maid outfit.
3.0,Cute shirt<br />Very thin! Must wear a bra<br />Little small<br />Not comfortable
3.0,I am enjoying my bike shorts but they were just a little less in quality than I expected
3.0,Holes developed after the first couple of wears. I think the material is too thin.
3.0,"It's alright, but it wasn't what I actually wanted. I wanted one where the phone is in an outer pocket. I couldn't find what I was actually looking for so I purchased this one. I am using it and it is OK."
3.0,"I wasn't sure what stars to give these pants, as they are super soft and my kid loves them for pajama pants but he was highly disappointed that they did not fit as represented.  They are tapered, but not ""skinny"" in any way, shape or form.  The picture has you to believe they get skinny around the knee.  And they are definitely not long enough to bunch at the ankle as shown.  My son is VERY short for his age and these pants barely make it to his ankles in his normal size.  I don't want to order a bigger size because then they will swallow him.  At least he is happy wearing them to bed."
3.0,easy to adjust and change the links.
3.0,"I really like the way these fit, my only complaint is that the band at bottom rolls, and does not stay flat"
3.0,Heavier then expected.
3.0,A thread was loose when I received it.  The quality doesn't seem that great.  It's cute though.  I won't bother returning it for a loose thread.
3.0,"I couldn't get what I want - they apparently no longer sell it.  This came direct from China, and it stinks of kerosene or something which they used to disinfect it. It is OK, I guess, when the kerosene evaporates."
3.0,Much much shorter unless you‚Äôre built like a 2x4!!!!
3.0,Runs tight in the arms. Cheaper feeling material but makes it more of a lightweight jacket.
3.0,"This belt is so large, it only fits me if I wear it as a regular belt. Trying to wear it as a dress belt, it won't stay up because it's too large. Just FYI. For reference, I'm 5'6 and weigh 125 lbs. Would not recommend if you have similar measurements to me."
3.0,"The star review was difficult, because my impression of the product and satisfaction with the purchase are different matters.  The skirt has a very nice construction, substantial fabric, and the zipper and button closure in the back is a nice feature.  Unfortunately, as I feared, the small is too large on me.  (25 inch waist.)  If they ever release an extra small size, I'll be there for it.  I love the design."
3.0,Muy peque√±a  no se sostiene firme
3.0,Sleeves are tooo tight.. Really wished it worked out for me.
3.0,The colors are a bit darker than what is seen here so it didn't match what I wanted it to.. but it's still a nice comfortable dress
3.0,Very difficult to close down once in your nose
3.0,A bit too slippery and it has lots of cloth balls coming out after washing them.
3.0,For whatever reason they offer these with an inner or outer seam in terms of which side the actual velvet is on and only one of them is labeled as such. You guessed it: its not this one. Terrible design literally serves no purpose.
3.0,It is a nice dress but arrive other size
3.0,Mine came today. I'm not sure what this metal tie type thing is for. I ordered two in each color and I like them. I'm giving them as Christmas gifts!
3.0,They work as expected.  What can you say for undergarments like this other than they do what they are supposed to
3.0,Print was absolutly adorable! I really wish they would allow to purchase top and bottom separately though. Top was way too small and bottom was way too big! As a 36DDD the XXL top was just cut to tiny. Fit around perfect but just not enough coverage. If I could have gotten a XXXL top and medium bottom this would have been my go to suit! So sad because it was a cute print but had to go back. I will say that I have other one pieces from this company and they are well made garments that hold up over time. This one just didn't hit the mark for me.
3.0,"Nice workout shirts, but they are NOT compression"
3.0,The picture above shows owl dangling earrings however I received Studded owl earrings. I really would have preferred to have gotten what I order however I still find them lovely and I'm going to keep them.
3.0,Again very nice but a gift
3.0,"It fits, but you can't really tell in the picture that there's a seam around mid thigh level and it makes it look matronly."
3.0,This is a great product if you're very thin. The small didn't fit my chest right and the medium makes everything too big. Comfy but won't wear out of the house
3.0,"They're a good deal for the price. The solid color ones are my favorite. The ones with any designs (such as leopard print) don't have any stretch to them, so they're hard to pull on and off. But you can't beat the price."
3.0,"Perfect thin, soft, warm Merino sock, except for 1 thing‚Ä¶ they ‚Äúooch‚Äù down into my shoes. Not sure if it‚Äôs my slightly thick ankles or what. I‚Äôm so disappointed, but will use with my house shoes. If you don‚Äôt have thick ankles, they are very nice when you need a thin wool sock."
3.0,"These leggings run big and they are not elastic. The fabric is cotton. More like PJ than working out leggings! The price is good. But if you‚Äôre looking for working out pants, these are not it!"
3.0,These are cute earrings but the lavender color is not lavender at all- its almost a grey/white- no hint of purple at all. Will be returning. Maybe another color would be okay but I need these to match a dress and they do not.
3.0,I am 5'9 and it definitely wasnt as long as it looks on these models.Which is what I was going for. But it works I guess.
3.0,"Goodness, so loose and long! Don't buy unless you're buying AT LEAST two sizes smaller than your true size. I'm 5ft 115 lbs and my 6ft 180lb boyfriend fit in this how I SHOULD HAVE<br /><br />Not for short people at all.<br /><br />Good fabric and true to color is why I didn't give this no stars."
3.0,"I have a couple pair of sunglasses that I wear regularly. Honestly, this doesn't fit them well. It's nearly impossible to slide them onto the glasses, to the point where you could borderline break your glasses. It comes very stiff, perhaps if you wore it more it would loosen up? Idk, if I could do it over again I would have not bought this product."
3.0,"I like the idea of this but didnt really work for my son, the strings slipped down on his head, and the rubber broke after one use . Also the star which suppose to keep the strings tight gets loose on its own. You do get few for the price"
3.0,The shirts are great but the pants are cheaply made.
3.0,"Love the look, but these socks strangle my legs! Very tight fit."
3.0,"I have so far purchased this top in three sizes: XL, L and then M. I am not a tiny person (I'm 5'5&#34; but I weigh 155) and even the medium is HUGE on me. I'll probably keep it, since the tunic-ish fit goes well with leggings, but if you want it to not fit like a tent, definitely size down."
3.0,I sized down and it was still too large and very long. Would make a very cute maternity top. Colors on the multi tie dye were very cute. Sadly had to return.
3.0,This is bigger than what I had expected. The stud in it is not suitable for a Monroe piercing
3.0,"I bought an extra large, because I am currently between sizes L and XL.  This shirt is unfortunately too tight on me even though I bought the size up instead of sizing down. It's a little depressing because I have been working out and have already lost so many inches."
3.0,Bag material looks cheap.  It looks better in the picture than it was in real life.
3.0,I looked at the measurement of this pendant before I bought it but it was still smaller than I expected - and not as curved as the picture seemed to depict it. It lies flat which makes it less attractive than it could have been.
3.0,"fastener, buckle, at back tangles in long hair.  pinches nose"
3.0,Only reason I'm given it 3 stars is because the pictured showed it can be folded & security logo shows on the outside but when I recieved it I can't fold it like the picture shows & still have security logo show. Good quality though. Logo not showing is only issue I had with this purchase.
3.0,cute dress! but it‚Äôs very see-through:(
3.0,I actually loved this suit. If fit well and was flattering with out looking grandma ish. But it is cheaply made and the one strap was not swen at all and the other was so loose it couldn't stay up. I returned it. I did order another one in hopes for a better one.
3.0,Overall the product quality was fine but the top was way too small on my chest. It looked like side boob but wasn‚Äôt in the traditional side boob spot If that makes sense. I got a large and I‚Äôm a 36D
3.0,They don't stay very well
3.0,"Pretty but very heavy. Really hung on my body. The fabric under the lace is stretchy & heavy. I think it fit ok, but not on me. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend for ANY warm weather."
3.0,The Sunglasses are very pretty but they are way to big!
3.0,Was hoping for better nubs on the foot for traction on floors.
3.0,"Pretty , but not of the best quality"
3.0,"For the money, it's not a bad watch.  The information on the screen and features are nice and it works well.  The biggest problem is that the numbers are very dim and hard to see.  I have to turn on the watch light anytime I want to see the time."
3.0,"Pretty but small, good size for double piercing though.  Good price, good quality, good seller/buyer experience."
3.0,Weird fit!  Tight in the top of the arms and the sleeves are way too long!!
3.0,It‚Äôs very pretty but a little on the light weight side. Could have been a little heavier
3.0,TOO SMALL ‚Ä¶ WALLMART HAS BETTER SOCKS
3.0,The leather is not the quality as the last pair I purchased. It stretches out too easily. Not worth the money
3.0,Wayyyyyy too small for an adult to wear :(
3.0,Material was more thin than expected.
3.0,"I bought this for a kid‚Äôs birthday, and I ordered two sets. One of the sets had a defective or run down battery. The workmanship inside the battery compartment was not robust. There were two 2016 batteries stacked at an odd angle. I am going to try to find the replacement batteries and see if it works, but it was disappointing to open."
3.0,it is very nice but my baby of 18 months will have to wait one or two years before he can use it :(
3.0,It was too small and scratched.
3.0,Sweater is beautiful but tiny even though I ordered up a size.
3.0,The dress is cute but I think it's my duty to inform others that the model in the photo is either wearing a larger size so it doesn't cut in at all or she has less than 8% body fat because it doesn't cut into her at all but the seams are actually quite tight and secure. Size up or just be okay with it super cutting into you.
3.0,My Real Madrid friends are jealous.
3.0,"The screw came loose and broke after 3 uses. Still super cute, though."
3.0,This charm looks better online than in person. Its to bulky and it doesnt look good on my charm bracelet and the credit card holder doesnt stay completely closed!!
3.0,Was to big..does not look like the picture
3.0,Top fit nicely and skirt is flowy. Fabric for skirt is cheap and colors appear faded.
3.0,"Stupid short. Even if you‚Äôre short, and really small framed, but have long legs, DO NOT GET. Fit great everywhere, but they‚Äôre high waters. Great quality though, but really short."
3.0,They were longer than expected. But I think I will still wear them.
3.0,"Bought the black version. Overall good, but the black color started rubbing off where band touches desk when typing, after 1 week.  I work in IT, that's the roughest treatment it gets."
3.0,"They're pretty shirts but they lay weird once they're on and the material is very thin. Definitely a shirt, not a sweater. Not to mention it's a little short, but the rest of the shirt fits fine"
3.0,I could not use this!  I could not breath in it so I gave them all to my husband who says they are okay but small fit from nose to under chin!  Would choose another!
3.0,Needed a some mending
3.0,"I have worn this jacket only three times for a combined total of only 2-3 hours. I only wore it from my door to the car, from the car to my office and back home, but it looks worse than the 8 year old jacket I replaced with what I thought was the perfect jacket.  It is pilling all over and looks worn out.  I really loved it when I got it - -  the perfect length, front zip, hood, and a great color, been looking for these combined features in a jacket for a long time so I am so disappointed,  otherwise would have given it 5 stars."
3.0,"Black paint on the side scratches off EXTREMELY easily, but for a cheap pair of sunglasses I like them. Just don't think you will replace Raybans or prescription sunglasses with these."
3.0,They are crooked.
3.0,For the price I guess it is not bad. Just disappointing that it is so big. The headband doesn't lay flat. It is super cute.
3.0,Much thinner than the originals. Probably won‚Äôt buy again.
3.0,"wasn't impressed with this product, this product can be used either as a hat or a neck warmer. disappointed with my purchase."
3.0,"The cut and the way this skirt is put together is awkward, bulky and uneven.  The print itself is pretty and very cute.  I will be returning it due to the way it is put together."
3.0,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers:  this dress does run EXTREMELY small.  I ordered a 3XL (I can usually wear an XL or 1X) and it still fits rather snugly.  On the up side, the dress is beautiful and I love the material."
3.0,have to wind up everyday
3.0,"A comfortable bra, though it's very thin. Not only will your nipples be visible when you're cold, they'll be visible thru  all but the thickest tops. Order a size up. I wear a 36, but this 36 fit more like a 34. It's so hard finding a comfortable and affordable bra when your cup size is higher than a D. I'm a 36G and was happy to find a comfortable bra with no underwire. It's just sad that it's so thin."
3.0,"My problem...I didn't actually check the specs...since they called it a Doggy Bag, I thought it would be small, and I could use it to carry my Kindle. Ha, we use it as a laundry bag. Agree with the other reviewer."
3.0,My order arrived with a hole right in the front!  I have one of these in a different color that I ordered.  The quality is ok for a quick throw-on or beach dress.  But I had to return the black dress due to the hole. I will reorder later and hope to not get a defective one.  I put a note in my return and let them know there was a hole and to not resell it.  5'-4&#34; 125 and a small fits.  Order up if you like things more lose up top.  The bottom is very baggy and wide.
3.0,"for dressing with jeans, it is ok but for forma pant too wide"
3.0,I bought them for my Lyphadema in my legs and they are doing good
3.0,It's ok. Very thin but I did what I needed to do with them.
3.0,Fell apart in less than 2 months of my son wearing them now and again to highschool.
3.0,The watch is relatively sturdy and attractive. However the watch movement itself is the worst I have even had. I have many years of ($7 and $10 watches from a box box store.) the minute hand moves and wiggles every time the second hand moves. So it can be hard to know which minute it is pointing at. It is also difficult to set because when you push in the crown the minute hand will sometimes move by a couple of minutes. It‚Äôs like the hearing is very loose. I don‚Äôt recommend. Just go get a cheap one at a big box store.
3.0,The body fit okay and it was cute but I had to send it back because the hood was HUGE. I seriously looked like a cult leader when I had the hood up.
3.0,I ordered this dress in an XL when I usually wear a medium. I ordered  two sizes up because of the measurements on the size chart. It was an average cotton dress not expensive. You get what you pay for.  üòú
3.0,The material was thin and did not look as if it would drape or wash well- returned.
3.0,"The fleece of the pants is wonderful but the fabric of the upper part us not nice, I feel a little disappointed  and my Husband didn‚Äôt like them"
3.0,i love the design and got complimented while wearing it but after few months it broke. quality of the pearl is nice but the one holding it is not. not as worth it. i wish the company has a way of offering customer repair.
3.0,"My wife used this to go to zumba classes. It worked as far as working out goes, but when. I went to wash it the seams separated and now it's all loose and floppy"
3.0,"They fit fine, just more compression than I like in my leggings. These are that much thicker legging material, like scuba skin, which I‚Äôm not about."
3.0,Was not expecting hard plastic.
3.0,Fit much smaller then the other that I received. Top fit fine
3.0,"I bought the 6-12mo for my 8mo baby, and the straps/sleeves wouldn‚Äôt stay on her shoulders. The straps are adjustable, but that didn‚Äôt help, it‚Äôs just the way it‚Äôs designed. Also, I bought the wine red, and it really is more purple than red."
3.0,"Material was very clingy, had to return"
3.0,it's OK
3.0,Very cute socks but too wide for my newborn.
3.0,"The leather is very thin and there's a four digit number stamp right on the visible part of the watch which really should have been on the inside or in a hidden part of the leather. Also I have slightly thicker than average wrists and the band is very long. I need to tuck it in at the end. Other than that the style is nice, I just don't think it will last very long because of how thin the leather is."
3.0,didn't fit me properly-returned
3.0,"The colors are beautiful but these are definitely not made for running or heavy exercise. I can walk on the treadmill or use the elliptical, but cannot run or do any type of jumping without my boobs flying all over the place. I am a 36DDD and I got the size XL.<br />Also, the white padding inside is well-visible through the bra. I took them out because I generally don't like padding in bras, but if you prefer the padding just be aware that you can see it in a weird way through the material, just as mentioned and pictured in other reviews."
3.0,"I'm a huge fan so I purchased this but I feel it's expensive and it takes forever to iron out the flag flat.  I wish they would roll this up and ship it instead of folding it into a thousand squares,"
3.0,Run small wish I had ordered 1/2 size lathering small
3.0,I own several of this brand of tops in different styles but this didn't fit as expected.
3.0,I love the shirt just too small. My 2x body didn't fit in the 3x shirt. I bought big just in case it would shrink. :(
3.0,"185/5'8'' --- So, I like what they are trying to do here. I like the concept - but, the fabric is way too thin, kinda boxy, the cuts are bold, good fit in chest-- a little loose in stomach ... This would be a good beach shirt, or like a super casual brunch with shorts and sandals. Def would look weird if you were to wear an undershirt or to try to dress up unless you have a super nice body. The price is about right."
3.0,I like it but it was much too tight. I just ordered another in a large and hoping it will fit. I normally wear a medium. Saw another review where the top was larger than expected. Hope the company is watching the sizing.
3.0,The shirt is cute but the material is not cotton. I bought the Heather gray tshirt. It fit good but the material not being cotton (it was more of a polyester with maybe 10% cotton) made the picture look weird.
3.0,"The dress fit perfectly, however, the accessories did not.<br />The tights were incredibly short and small, clearly not plus size.<br />The pearl necklace was broken before I even took it out of the package.<br />The gloves were entirely too small.<br />The headband barely fit around my wrist, let alone my head.<br />Overall, count on the dress to be great & fit well. but definitely not the accessories."
3.0,"I tried this for running while I had a broken little toe, so my Vibram Five-Fingers were not useable.  The big toe box wasn't big enough for my big toe, though.  I might have liked it better if mine fit me, but my toe healed too quick to make this worth re-trying in a different size."
3.0,I can tell you the shirt looks cool and is a nice material but sadly my big head won't fit and returning it will cost over half its worth. So I guess it's a nice gift down the road.
3.0,"Bought for a Halloween costume, didn't wear it.  Was just too cartoony for me."
3.0,"Cute dress, but too short."
3.0,Cute socks but hardly any compression to them. Nice quality too so I will still wear them with boots
3.0,"I guess I should have checked the description more closely. These are extremely cute. However when I put them in, my ears immediately started stinging and turning bright red and I had to take them out. I wear other earrings specifically for sensitive ears without an issue but I am guessing these aren‚Äôt quite the same. Too bad! The style is amazing and elegant."
3.0,If I can find the time to sew something to stiffen the sides a bit and to sew the straps on permanently this will be way better.  They put functional buckles on it but have them snap on at the bottom.  This is redundant and is asking to have the buckles fall off and get lost.  If you sew them on and bypass the snap all will be well.
3.0,I ordered a medium and should have sized up. I am 5'2 135. This is well made and the color is very nice but it is a cling material and I like my nightshirts to be a bit more roomy.
3.0,Smaller than I thought but nice purse
3.0,"So this skirt is...not all that appealing. The fabric is super cheap, like that shimmery nylon material that doesn't bleach. The design is printed on, and the skirt has poor movement. My fianc&eacute; asked if I was going to a badminton tournament because I looked like the birdie. It fits a little awkwardly around the waist, not inclined to lay flat but bunch and twist at the waistline. There are some random seams placed that don't make any sense, but if you hide them in the back, then YOU can't see them."
3.0,I'm 5'7&#34; and the suspenders were just barely long enough to wear. If you're any taller they will pull your pants right up into your throat through your ass.
3.0,Was way too big; perhaps I didn't read the sizing appropriately.
3.0,"The price on the Capri leggings was good, but the size was smaller than expected and too thin to wear like my regular leggings."
3.0,Quality is So So .. They are to clear .. You can see through them
3.0,they are cute and they glow well under black light BUT they are difficult to put together.
3.0,Comes straight from China; Shirt shrunk.
3.0,Not easy to put on. Very snug fit. Colors are beautiful.
3.0,Cute but very cheap-looking.
3.0,"These run very small, you might buy one or two sizes larger."
3.0,"Got this for the wife for the second anniversary, which is apparently the cotton anniversary.<br /><br />Wife is 5ft5 110lbs and usually wears an Xs or s. Ordered the s because she likes her pjs on the loose side.<br /><br />They looked just like they did online, and the wife thought they were really cute. To me, the tie dye looked like something I did as a 10 year old and not professional, but no big deal. I thought they felt a little rough and scratchy, but wife said it was okay because they were loose. Hopefully will soften in the wash."
3.0,Cute but not 100% cotton underwear.
3.0,"Pretty, seems to be good quality, but it runs WAY small.  I normally wear a 2X, but after looking at the Amazon size chart, I decided to get a 3X in this particular item.  Ridiculous!  I'll need at least one, maybe two sizes larger.  I also ordered my usual 2X in a different flannel nightgown, and that fits quite well, so this item is definitely the problem."
3.0,these are just ok.
3.0,The picture threw me off . I was thinking I was buying 8 capes. Overall pretty good
3.0,The same thing I said above. Great belt . Could you make it longer. Oh by the way I gave the other ones as  a gift. And they love them..<br />Now can you make one or 2  for me. 50&#34; long. If yes send them and I will pay through AMAZON. Thank you.
3.0,The belly ring is pretty. The color is purple and not blue-ish/purple like the picture shows. The description didn't mention to remove belly ring before bathing and swimming. Because it did tarnish.
3.0,My daughter loves her horse. The socks were cute
3.0,"I like the chain.  I am very concerned that it will not fit.  I bought it for my son as a gift, he has not received it yet.  It seems small at just over 8&#34;"
3.0,Love neff watches in general; only watch I like to wear daily.<br /><br />Was alittle smaller then I expected.
3.0,I liked the color and and the pockets even if it was a little heavy. However it will not fit your iphone 8+ which was the point so its going back.
3.0,Came with a weird smell.
3.0,"The 'gems' on the jewelry pieces are actually plastic pieces you would use for a preschool craft. The metal is heavy (not good for earrings), and the bracelets run small but are very unique and pretty, and they fit on my tiny hands/wrists. Would have given 1 or 2 star were it not for the bracelets and necklaces that I got."
3.0,"The material is nice but they roll up pretty quickly and they're surprisingly hot for such a thin layer. Fine if you're mostly concerned about making a low neckline more modest, but they roll up too much to be useful for much else."
3.0,Bought for 4 year old son who is average size. It was a bit big
3.0,"I purchased the Brown and Navy in in size Large.<br />Approximate measurements laying flat unstretched:<br />Chest underarm to underarm 22""<br />Length shoulder to hem 28""<br />Across hem 17""<br />Sleeve length shoulder seam to cuff 25""<br />Across shoulders sleeve seam to seam 18""<br /><br />My husband wears a size large in basic relaxed t-shirts, 32x32 jeans, and this sweater fit like a relaxed large. The sweater is a medium weight stretch knit. The knit is small and tight so I think with a base layer it would be quite warm. It's really really soft on the outside, smooth but not quite as soft on the inside. Overall for the price, I paid $12.99 plus tax and free Prime shipping, it's a well made good quality sweater.<br /><br />**UPDATE - Cold wash and hang to dry with no shrinkage but it pilled all over. Made it look very worn and old. Navy sweater already developed a hole in one sleeve. I originally rated these 4 stars but due to the pilling I lowered the rating."
3.0,Not the same color blue as shown in the pic. Fits a little smaller than I'd thought.
3.0,Nice but backing was very difficult to use. Actually couldn‚Äôt use them . I had to use others in my jewelry box to be able to wear these.
3.0,The filter is a little bit bigger than the pouch you put it in and there's no adjustable nose clamp to stop the air from coming up and fogging your glasses
3.0,"These did not fit my shape well. Fit in the waist, too loose around the hips, and not quite tight enough in the legs. My hips measure about 41‚Äù, each thigh about 23‚Äù, and waist around 31‚Äù. They would definitely ride up when I got on my bike or went for a run. They are tagless which is comfortable but the overall fit was a little disappointing."
3.0,"Purchased XL for my boyfriend and the gloves are excellent quality but the fingers are very short and won‚Äôt fit even my medium sized lady fingers. It‚Äôs a shame, have to send these back :("
3.0,"Great quality for the price, but I thought that the bag was a bit small for a tote.  It seemed smaller than its stated dimensions.  It was definitely ok if you just want a larger handbag."
3.0,too small for my western head
3.0,Not durable....stones coming off in under a month.
3.0,This swimsuit did not come in a brown cheetah like it shows on the picture. But it‚Äôs cute. Be aware that they are VERY thin with no liner. Not even in the crotch section. But cute for as cheap as it was.
3.0,"Pom pom is too big., warm"
3.0,Wish these came in a box...they come lumped in a rubber band...
3.0,Quality seemed fine but it looked more like a cowboy hat than a fedora. I returned it.
3.0,I like the design and appearance. Quite attractive. However I couldn't get my credit cards and drivers license to fit and be able to pull them out for ease of use.
3.0,The width is good but the length is almost like a dress and the sleeves are really baggy and long. Hoping it will shrink in the wash.
3.0,A very simple dress made light.
3.0,"The band does not match the picture. The picture shows a two-piece band, and what I received is a one piece band which loops over and has a different-looking ""clasp"" than the one pictured.  That said, the band is lightweight and very flexible, with a strong magnet.  I have a wrist that is 6 inches in circumference and this band is so large it is just barely OK.  I have a 44mm series 4 watch and I ordered the 42-44 size band.  I really ordered this because I thought it was a 2 piece band as pictured, so overall I was disappointed."
3.0,Top was really cute but size is not true! Order a size  or two bigger than you wear cause they are really small !
3.0,"The dress was pretty but returned because it fit a little tight and was SO HEAVY! if you‚Äôre looking for a light material then don‚Äôt get this dress , you will sweat like crazy!"
3.0,"My son had to have these but they are not worth the price at all. After charging them one shoe continually turns off in about 20 minutes. They are comfy though per my son, just a little on the heavy side."
3.0,They work but determining the correct size is not easy
3.0,"I like the color, fits as expected and it is very comfy! But it came with two holes ! It looks like it is coming undone!"
3.0,"It does not look like it does in the photo at all. The colors are not the same either.<br />I was disappointed with that.<br />It fits fine so I decided to keep it. Not sure what I can where it with, but I guess that will be determined"
3.0,Ended up giving this away - I do not have a large wrist -abs this was to tight ! Disappointed
3.0,"Color and style of the dress are wonderful and I love the pockets. The quality of the stitching is very poor, however. The seam under the bust is uneven and allows some of the stiches to be visible on the front side of the dress. The stiching is coming out near one of the pockets after only two washes. I want to order more of these, but am leery due to the quality issues."
3.0,"Wouldn't use it &#34;day-to-day&#34; but for my collection & &#34;Dress-up&#34; it's fine, would have been nice if it came with a instruction sheet."
3.0,"I love the color (purchased the pink) and generally the shape of the dress. It‚Äôs a little bit long and the front is a little too low cut. If you have larger breasts prepare to show a little cleavage, or wear something underneath. Actually, you may have to wear a slip because it‚Äôs a little see-through, but unfortunately the fabric is pretty clingy so not sure if a slip will fit underneath. I like the pockets, they‚Äôre a nice touch."
3.0,Brought it larger then had it taken in so now it's perfect
3.0,Love the leopard print but they don't stay screw on I've swallowed 3 of them.
3.0,I love the earrings but they were too big they look smaller on the paper I'll give to my daughter for her birthday she'll wear them thank you
3.0,Not was I was looking for
3.0,"The glasses came in a box casing with a magnetic closing lid. There is also a cleaning cloth included. I get headaches from viewing computer and screens, and I use both often. I had never tried, or even thought of getting tented lenses to help with the sensitivity.<br /><br />My thoughts on these particular ones‚Ä¶<br />They are a slight large frames, but the arms still fit nicely on the sides of my head. Not too loose and not too snug. With my experience with these glasses, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them for regular lights in the house, it‚Äôs difficult to see, but I found them helpful when using them for screen viewing on the phone and computer. Over time though I noticed it started irritating the bridge of my nose, and my eyes had a difficult time readjusting to light once I took them off. Another issue I had was that these glasses came with a small crack in the lens, and had smudge marks that cannot be cleaned or wiped away, which can be seen in the last two images I posted. So when wearing these glasses it‚Äôs difficult not to get bothered or distracted when glaring through these imperfections.<br />Overall, I like the concept of these glasses, but it needs a bit of tweeking."
3.0,It‚Äôs pretty. The rhinestones eventually fall off though.
3.0,It's designed for a very small hand. Kids hand!<br />It is nice and comes with a sizing tool. Only it needs more links not less.<br />Buy it if you have a small hand.<br />It seem sturdy and is easy t swap out.
3.0,The vest is well made and a good value for $29.99<br />The only problem is that the largest size available (XL) is comparable to American size L
3.0,Fits larger than normal size 8 and no comfort in bottom of shoes
3.0,Wish top was a little bigger and longer<br />Pants nice fit. I 5‚Äô2‚Äù. 115#
3.0,"After returning a large and medium sizes, I ordered the small. But the back is too big and the front pocket area is baggy.  I'm 5'3 and 155 lbs. Hopefully I can shrink by washing it first. The delivery was super fast though."
3.0,Nice thin fabric but stitches are poorly done.
3.0,The dimensions are off. Definitely will need to alter it.
3.0,"The wallet was pretty and my IPhone 6s Plus fits in the compartment that looks like it was meant to hold sunglasses. Wasn't impressed with the shoulder strap and the clasp was broken. Seller's customer service - eh, not impressed. Amazon customer service was awesome."
3.0,I feel like these are sized for a man and I found them too large for me. I was hoping for a different result while wearing them too. They are okay.
3.0,"The quality is cheap.  After a few hours of wearing it, it rides up and gets really annoying.  I won‚Äôt be buying more of these."
3.0,Cute but the noise makers didn't work very well. The kids loved the hats but were disappointed by the noise makers.
3.0,"This ring guard is hilariously cheap. It is scratchy, the gold color faded after a week, and it was bent when I got it. But, it was very inexpensive and it does the job! I'm going to go to a jeweler and have them put in a better one."
3.0,Great dress but the breast pads were awful ‚òπÔ∏è
3.0,The 8mm are so small they'd only work for cartilage piercings. They are the proper gauge for typical lobe piercings. The 10mm barely works for my 2nd lobe
3.0,Beautiful top but the arms were too tight so couldn't wear ... sigh
3.0,"Not exactly the color I was expecting, a little short in length,"
3.0,"These jammies fit fine and are pretty comfortable. I was a bit bummed with the color as they are more orangey red, rather than a vivid, bold, fire engine red."
3.0,This piece is extremely hard to get on and it is too fragile to wear. I accidentally broke this within five minutes because I rubbed a surface of a bed a little too hard. I recommend that you do not but this product.
3.0,i ordered a size larger than i usually am. the bra is not that comfortable. it has seams on the interior of the garment that have loose cloth. i kept adjusting during my run. really distracting. not enjoyable. although the support was adequate I would not buy this again
3.0,Nice comfy fit but when you walk the pants rise some
3.0,"While we received Baby Yoda masks, they were not the ones pictured. My daughter was disappointed and thought the ones we received were too ‚Äúboyish‚Äù for her."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:420409d00e0c16bddfecda1462bebd2b]] This two piece tracksuit is not jogger material and it‚Äôs small in the pants and the material is moreso polyester. I wouldn‚Äôt get item again‚Ä¶.
3.0,"Great belt! Size way off! Not my fault. I suggest buying smaller then you would. Rule I was/have given is 2 over your waist. Size 32, buy 34. I've had only purchased belts in stores for the last 20 years and have never been wrong with that rule. This belt and most belts coming from Asia seem to be very large for the waist size."
3.0,"After trying this dress on, I decided to keep it. It fits as expected and is a cute beach dress. It is lined but the material does seem cheap. I don‚Äôt expect it to last through more than one wash.<br />The worst thing is how horribly wrinkled it is. I won‚Äôt be able to wear it until I have it steamed. I don‚Äôt trust myself to iron it because the material is just too thin/fragile.<br />I would‚Äôve sent it right back because of this but the fit is flattering and we are leaving for vacation next weekend."
3.0,Look better on the website
3.0,[[VIDEOID:59166647ee244078fc8a20014c6ee0df]] I got it to have the picture of my bestfriend on it and it cut off half his head around the neck part it should have been moved up
3.0,"Sent the wrong size, I‚Äôm a 42‚Äù chest and 48‚Äù shoulder. Ordered an XL but got an XXL in the mail. Will work over a sweater but I won‚Äôt be wearing it over a T-shirt. Too much hassle to return it and wait for another."
3.0,"A bit scratchy, and runs tight. But it does have a great shape to it."
3.0,Great looking but not quality material. They get the job done though.
3.0,"These are cute, but I can't figure out quite how to wear them.  They aren't tight enough to stay at the ankle, but not long enough to wear at the calf.  I think I just have to get used to the looseness.  But they are very cute!"
3.0,Comfortable but overpriced. And the attachment pieces fall out and can get lost when not in watch. Not sure why the image is a bag and there isn‚Äôt a relevant mobile app. Weird product listing. Ok product.
3.0,"I like the bracelet. It is very pretty and feels really good on my wrist. However, one of the stones is turned backwards and I am going to have to restring it to fix it. If I were giving or sending to someone as a gift, I would be very unhappy with my purchase."
3.0,Too short ship out today. 08-06-2020.
3.0,"Fabric was thin, thin, thin."
3.0,A little odd fit
3.0,"Good product, pricing vs quality is enough.<br />Fast delivery, good seller, thanks."
3.0,"Very short in the front, much smaller hole for the next than anticipated so it doesn't fall off of the shoulder very well..."
3.0,Much smaller than the Locs I get at the swap meets
3.0,"I got these gloves as I‚Äôm in northern Indiana and they seemed like they‚Äôd be warm, the price was great and I liked the texting feature. Unfortunately the texting, at least on the pair I got does, doesn‚Äôt work at all. Maybe it‚Äôs a defective pair. As the price was great and they are warm I‚Äôll keep them."
3.0,I originally ordered the white/ cream color in a small. It was see through and the shorts were way to small. I returned and ordered a medium in the grey. The top is slightly big and the shorts don‚Äôt fit as I would like. I think this set would look good on someone tall and skinny. It is exactly as pictured and good quality just does not look good for my body type. Good for tall skinny legs!! The shorts are much longer as pictured as well.
3.0,"I love the colors, material and style. It does not fit as an extra large but a medium."
3.0,"I loved this dress but it went through the dryer ONCE on low heat and no joke SHRUNK 8 inches shorter. I was so sad. I still wear it, just as a shirt now ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3.0,Flares out too much at the hips. It has pockets though so that was nice.
3.0,"This sword is good quality, but buyer beware, it is fairly thin and very small.  Pay attention to the dimensions before ordering."
3.0,"Great length and the color/pattern is beautiful, but it is very see through material"
3.0,Too long falls off.
3.0,Really cute and great in color but the string they are on gets stretched out after wearing it a couple times so now it‚Äôs too big for my wrists and I can‚Äôt wear it. Kind of disappointing.
3.0,After about an hour the sticky failed
3.0,too oily
3.0,"These are nice except I'm short (5')so they don't fit as perfect as I would like, but that's to be expected. Overall I still will wear them, just maybe fold then down or something."
3.0,Dress was a bit snug.
3.0,I‚Äôm on the buster spectrum of girls and it‚Äôs hard for me to find shirts that can hold well without being tight and this shirt was very snug don‚Äôt get if your bigger
3.0,These slippers are very uncomfortable and have an awkward fit. The soles are very thick and bulky.
3.0,There just regular leggings. Nothing special. Too small for me but returning is a pain.
3.0,I ordered an XL (wear size 14) and couldn‚Äôt even get it over my shoulders! Thick material but definitely size up!
3.0,"Did not receive in time for trip, a little small"
3.0,"Nice looking gloves and I used them while clearing snow in Chicago.  Outside temperature was 12‚Ñâ and although I have warm hands, these gloves did little to keep my fingers from freezing.  They're fine to walk the dog when I can use my coat pockets.<br /><br />Also be aware that the gloves are short, the length comes just past the wrists so they don't keep the snow out.  I should have noticed the length before I bought them.  So they're fine as work gloves but not to do work in the snow."
3.0,"I got these for my husband to wear in the gym showers. As other viewers said it runs small, I ordered a size up, and it was still a little small. The piece between the toes is thick and stiff enough to make them too uncomfortable to wear beyond the shower. As shower shoes they're acceptable though."
3.0,Runs very small.  Would need to size up two sizes!  Disappointed
3.0,Love it as a top shirt. As a skirt is too short and if you have curve is gonna be more short. You have to be as skinny like the girl in the picture to be able to wear it. But overall as a top looks nice.
3.0,"they look good , would of given it 5 stars but  the pack came one button short"
3.0,Fits right. But you can barely read the ‚ÄúDad‚Äù or the inscription on the inside. My daughter ordered it for me though so you know I‚Äôm wearing it no matter what
3.0,The outfit was perfect for what I was looking for the only thing I didn‚Äôt like is it came with a hole /tear in the dress.Which I can‚Äôt wear it .Otherwise I really loved the outfit and it can be styled in many ways .material was great .
3.0,"It's a good product overall, but one of the shirts came with a hole in it. Very disappointed that I couldn't find a way to get a hold of them either than to send the product back with no support. Had it not been for the hole, it is a very nice lightweight material with nice colors. Suggest wearing a tank top for lighter colors underneath for modesty if necessary."
3.0,"Bought 3 colors, black, grey, red. Grey was smaller in one whole size tight on the arms. Black and red dress courts and feels nice."
3.0,I love these pj's but the sizes run to small I think I should have ordered and XXL
3.0,"A bit thin and narrow. I thought the quality would be better and a deeper purple. Still, it's good though as I wear it proudly for my Mom"
3.0,No stretch to it.
3.0,Very see through light weight material too big
3.0,I received the package early than expected but the only problem is that the bead on top of the teddybear forehead fall apart
3.0,Just needed the hat. Part of an 80s party costume.
3.0,"It was a bit on the smaller side. The pants are horrible. They're ugly, thin, cheaply made and you can tell. They just look horrible compared to the nice shirt."
3.0,Very pretty hot the green don't know what kind of stone it is but still pretty but very large and heavy on the ears !
3.0,The chain in the middle is a little large for my ears. But with a bit of oil they go thru. I do like their look so I kept them
3.0,"bought as a gift, the recipient liked it at first but then said the black started flacking off."
3.0,I love this bags.. it's nice and big...i just wish it was suede... What  I like About it the most is the detail faux stitching gives it bit more character.
3.0,"The color of the item seemed accurate, the material is very soft, but order a size down. It runs large. I washed and dried it thinking it would shrink some, since it was oversized, but it didnt. I ordered an xxlg and its more like a 2x or 3x."
3.0,Love it however the clasp easily comes undone and I have to keep fixing it
3.0,Gets foggy
3.0,Feels weird wore it 1 time
3.0,Too baggy should be a slimmer fit.
3.0,"As beautiful as it is with its stones and rose-gold enhancements, the quality of the stretch belt is not what I found in other elastic belts I've found on Amazon.  I'm keeping it because the color and style of the belt are nice, hoping it won't stretch out of shape too soon."
3.0,"It is too big and too small all at the same time.  Not as big of a fan in person of the look, either."
3.0,"This anklet looks really cute both on and off your ankles.  The problems are as follows:  First, it says its 18K gold.  OBVIOUSLY, it's not.  If it was 18 Karat Gold, how in the world would it cost $11?  Secondly, 18 K Gold is not this color.  The Gold is a bright, very fake looking gold.  So the marketing is a complete sham.  The second and perhaps more problematic problem is the clasp.  It is a very strange clasp that comes undone very easily.  I wore it for a few hours and it fell off twice.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars because it's super cute but that's about it!<br /><br />I received a sample for review."
3.0,"Super cute shoes, but... they did run very small and you can see glue around the sole of the shoe. Shipped fast."
3.0,The rubber quality is not good but still acceptable.
3.0,Nice ring but it has layers in order to have the wire in there and it's already seperating.
3.0,"The sizes are at least one size larger than the actual size.  The material is lightweight and flimsy,  I would not wear this without something underneath as the fabric is a little on the sheer side."
3.0,This sock fits almost like footy socks. From the images i thought the sock would fit higher up similar to tube socks but a little past the ankles they go. The African logo appears that it may not last long so definitely may let them air dry because it looks like heat would damage the logo. Not as good of quality as i  expected.
3.0,Not as comfortable as I thought they would be
3.0,These break really easily.
3.0,i really like this blouse. i even ordered a size up.. very pretty though
3.0,"The color is very faded and its bigger than I expected. For the price, I'm keeping it for running errands or very casual days."
3.0,Fits a little snug in the bust.
3.0,Very satisfied and shipment was fast.
3.0,"These were inexpensive, I get that. But the magnetic closure didn‚Äôt work well and one strand broke within a week."
3.0,"Love the style and medium usually fits, but these ran smaller than usual."
3.0,These weren‚Äôt compressing me and there showed flaws rather than compressing or slimming in any way - I just didn‚Äôt like them I returned them
3.0,The bathing suit is well-made and the top is attractive. The skirt is too long for those with shorter legs. Returned it.
3.0,"Great collection item, but for wearing them they are very low quality. Still a cool Naruto piece"
3.0,The rose gold plating wore off of the band part in like a month. I love the bracelet though and am still wearing it.
3.0,"The colors are not the same as the picture. Great material, but expected different colors closer to the ones shown in the picture."
3.0,"They are very pretty, but are smaller than anticipated.  I expected a more substantial look to them."
3.0,"Look cute and the fabric seemed sort. However,  runs small and has minimal stretch. Weren‚Äôt comfortable so will be returning."
3.0,"Ok so this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my 6yr old niece.  It was originally supposed to arrive December 4th but didn't arrive until December 24th (too late to give my niece so we had to buy something else for her). When we contacted the seller, they did give a discount for the delay which was good.  It was ordered for a size 5-7 but fits my 9 month old daughter.  It would have been waaaaaayyy too small for the 6yr old niece.<br />When it finally arrived, the color wasn't really what I was expecting but the fabric is really soft and fluffy.  It didn't work out for what it was purchased for but we didn't return it."
3.0,"Runs small and FYI, the suit does not give full coverage on your backside. I returned for that reason, but otherwise, I was pleased and would have kept."
3.0,"I was really thrilled in the beginning, but I just happened to touch it and the medal fell off in my hands.  The clasp on the chain is extremely weak. It won't close all of the way.  I'm very upset.  Now I have to spend MORE money to get the clasp replaced."
3.0,"It was smaller than I execpted, but is perfect for a 4 year old to carry with dance shoes, and maybe a leotard!"
3.0,Very cute but two buttons fell out at first wear
3.0,"Good price It works for a little bit, but after while the velcro stops sticking, after about 2 1/2 - 3 weeks."
3.0,"The socks were tight and left imprints on your skin, too expensive for the quality, the toe stitching was not good the cotton overlapped  and was uncomfortable when walking in shoes."
3.0,"I like this Satinato women‚Äôs camisole tank, but it is not as described at the time I ordered it‚Äîif one expects the item to be as described and it arrives otherwise then the customer may be disappointed. No shelf bra, and sometimes it rolls up, however, yesterday with some slacks I had on, it stayed put pretty well.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The camisole tank is soft.<br />The black is a true black and not that gray-black<br />There‚Äôs no tag - the info is printed in shiny silver on the back<br /><br />What I don‚Äôt like, or what is different from described:<br />There is no shelf bra to this‚Äîif I‚Äôm wearing it during the day with a bra, no big deal; however, when sleeping, I like the shelf bra, and I ordered it for sleeping. I‚Äôll still sleep in it, but wanted that shelf bra as I‚Äôm large breasted. (I did sleep in it last night and it did fine without the shelf bra, but still, I‚Äôd like one just for added support).<br />It‚Äôs not that long‚ÄîI‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and this comes to my hips or if I pull it down and stretch it it will go over my hips. I don‚Äôt care so much that it‚Äôs not long, but again, if you describe it that way, then it should be that way.<br />IT ROLLS! Drives me crazy how it rolls up - even though they say it doesn‚Äôt, it does roll up. I‚Äôm constantly pulling it down ‚Äîthis is the most frustrating thing about the tank. But if you wear it with certain clothes, it stays put. On your bare skin, though, not so much.<br /><br />Sizing:<br />My top is a medium but it fits like a small. I don‚Äôt mind the close fit, but you may consider sizing up. I wear an extra-small or small in tops and this medium fits very snugly (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù about 117, for reference)."
3.0,A lot smaller than expected. They are not that pretty or shiny but you get what you pay for. I've been wearing them for several weeks now the balls have not fallen off easily.
3.0,Thought they were for children but actually.adult size.
3.0,Got the biggest size and is to small for my hands
3.0,You will need to order atleast a size up.  Pants were cute and made out of comfy thick material but to small.
3.0,"I hope you have a wig cap because, when I wore this for the fist time to an anime con I didn't! The pony tail is super heavy, and pulls the wig back as I walk around the anime con, cosplaying as Erza from Fairy Tale. It is adjustable but only a little bit, making easy to put on yet, hard to KEEP on. I admit this is my first year of cosplaying and didn't know the importance of a wig cap or how you fix your hair under a wig.<br />I saw other Erza cosplayers and asked them how they kept their wigs on. They said they braided their hair and made buns to fit under the wig, making a tighter and sturdier fit.<br />It was annoying fixing the wig on and off all day at the anime con but the color is PERFECT for Erza. A dark red but not too dark. The color of this wig is the best part of it. I am sure if I play around with it, I can figure out how to keep the clip on pony tail from pulling it down."
3.0,"Super cute, but loop hole for tying in the back broke the 2nd time I wore the dress. Not great quality."
3.0,I am using this as a decoration so worth the money but as a costume i could see it being flimsy
3.0,"This dress is cute but warning; I am almost 5'8 and this dress came well passed my knees, looked a little matronly and the color was TEAL and NOT Navy blue so I am returning. Cute dress if want something longer and not Navy!"
3.0,"It‚Äôs the right size, but it sits too far off my face."
3.0,"This bag was a very pretty color and the rope strap was super cute. This bag was just a lot smaller than I was counting on. If you just want something big enough for a small wallet, phone and keys, then this is your bag."
3.0,"This jacket wasn‚Äôt awful, but I didn‚Äôt like it enough to keep it. It‚Äôs pretty much as advertised, but the outer material felt a little cheap and was noisy. It was warm, and fit okay, but was a bit short in the sleeves. Maybe I just don‚Äôt like the 3-in-1 design, but it just didn‚Äôt seem comfortable enough to wear with anything thicker than t-shirt material. If I had ordered a size up, it would have looked bulky."
3.0,These ran a bit large.
3.0,Heads up‚Ä¶.if you want the same look as the girl in the photo‚Ä¶size up.<br />Love the feel‚Ä¶.but the t shirt does show any lumps and bulges.  I usually wear an XL.  I should have gotten a 1x for a more smoother look.
3.0,"bottoms were cute, but hte top is not sized to match. The top is barely wide enough to cover one boob."
3.0,Super cute. Luckily I listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. The reason for the 4 stars is the sleeves are so snug and the material does not have any stretch or movement to them at all.
3.0,Not Best but does the job!
3.0,"Have 3 OR hats, all lg, all 3 fit extremely different."
3.0,not as pretty as the picture and the surface already started to flake off after wearing for just a couple of hours.
3.0,"Some of these are thin and broke easily on the first day if wearing. However, their customer service was wonderful and they shipped a new set right out to my daughter."
3.0,Fits very loose in bust and normal throughout rest of dress. Stiff fabric. I waited too long to return it....
3.0,"Overall these are really nice boxers, well made, good material, nice fit/finish, but then ergonomic aspect is a little off. The leggings are slightly short, and small banded. Not by much, maybe an inch on both accounts. I am a pretty average shaped guy and although I can wear these there are others that are more comfortable. They do wash fine, and look really nice. I am 5' 11&quot; 175 lbs and wear a 32-34 denim. I ordered the XL size."
3.0,Very pretty too bad it is one size only
3.0,"It is a good cheap belt but it stinks like compost. After a week of wearing in a heavy construction repair shop it still smells.<br />The heavy smell is gone but it still does have a &#34;scent&#34; to it but the company read my review and did contact me.  That in itself is huge on my part.  If you need a work belt, this is perfect."
3.0,Zipper for change broke within a month of having it.
3.0,"It's HEAVY to carry, I gave it to my daughter who doesn't have back problems.  I thought it was cute, it's very LARGE, and it is a heavy purse. I did get lots and lots of compliments on it and my daughter admits she gets many compliments, but, it was too heavy for me. My back issues are sensitive and I did just find out I'm having surgery."
3.0,WORSE AFTER WASHING DUE TO SHRINKING
3.0,"The crystals are very pretty and seem to be good quality but if you're looking for a pink rose quartz this is not the pendant you should buy. It is completely white, which is natural but still disappointing if you're expecting the crystals from the picture. Overall a good price for the products. Perfect size"
3.0,"Poor quality, not worth $8.99...i would have paid less for them."
3.0,"El modelo es bonito, puse 3 Estrellas por que equivoqu√© el talle .."
3.0,"The description says there is a pocket, but there is no pocket. Very disappointing!"
3.0,Ruff feel but look good kinda small for the spacing on the ear
3.0,"These slippers felt good when I first put them on. After wearing them the short time (less than two months) that I have had them, they are fitting sloppily. Sad to see this happen as I wear slippers everyday."
3.0,I have mixed feelings about these. They are very cute and we‚Äôre perfect for our dragon teeth necklaces for a birthday party. But I had to re-glue all of the teeth/claws to the base because they popped right out.
3.0,"When I first opened the package they looked very nice but a couple of days went by and I noticed how horrible the cutting is on the fabric. It's jagged like someone cut it with scissors. There are hesitation marks in the fabric which makes it look incredibly cheaply made. I've gotten compliments on the necklaces which also feel very cheaply made. They are incredibly light and one good tug on it from my two year old and it's all over.<br /><br />All in all, it's okay but I don't think these shirts are going to last very long. The stitching is just okay but the fabric is very, very cheap."
3.0,"I personally don't like the way this shirt sit on my body.  The pockets look like they're pulling open a little bit.  Also, the small collar doesn't lay flat and straight."
3.0,"These socks have a nice feel to them, and the compression is good.  However, I'm only 5'6 and wear size 8 shoes, and the medium size socks are about an inch too long for my foot and the compression sock only comes up to the middle of my calf."
3.0,Good quality but the sizing was not accurate!!
3.0,This is a nice hoodie. Thin though and definitely not official merch.
3.0,Magnet is pretty weak.
3.0,Loved how the cap looked on me but it was soooo uncomfortable that first day it gave me headaches and I ended up taking it off during lunch. I also where glasses so I‚Äôm not sure if that was why it was uncomfortable as well
3.0,"Shipped on time and arrived without a scratch, but they just don't fit my 5-yr-old's head well. Nose space on the glasses is too wide and the ear pieces too tight. I don't think he'll wear them. :("
3.0,"Beautiful print, but very thin material and arrived with the seam around the waist ripped open."
3.0,Product was not well made. Stitches didnt line up. Not true to size. The top was huge for a small and the bottoms to small. Cant mix and match sizes. I never ended up wearing it
3.0,"I ordered both the ARANEE and the ACEVOG dress in this light turquoise floral pattern. They are cut almost identically, but there are little differences between the two. ARANEE was a light blue color and had a white hidden zipper, while ARANEE was light green with a matching light green zipper. The patterns were almost identical - except for certain details: the branches on the ARANEE were colored with red, on ACEVOG, they were brown, and the flowers and leaves on ACEVOG were colored with more detail and depth than on ARANEE. It almost felt like the ARANEE version was a photocopy of a photocopy of the ACEVOG pattern; like the big designs were there, but the little details got lost.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think I ordered the wrong size. I'm a pretty solid size 14, 36DD and ordered the large. The dresses both fit too snugly in the back for my comfort. Thankfully, the material has some stretch in it! But, I'm going to return and try the next size up."
3.0,"This is super comfortable but the first time I used it, it got caught on to my Velcro part of my bag and it created a big hole."
3.0,To small for my taste. Kept them for gift  for xmas
3.0,bought this for my daughter but it was to large
3.0,The wide of belt is not expected.
3.0,"It fits right, but was very disappointed that the inside of the right shoes wasn‚Äôt even glued down! Looks like the glue they used didn‚Äôt hold at all. Idk what is wrong with it it‚Äôs just all folded up vs.s the left shoe. Other then that they seem good. We will see how a 7 year old active boy does in them."
3.0,"Shipped quickly. Be advised that the gold bar is thinner than one you'd get at clothing sales. I'm sure that no one is going to call me out on it, just be aware."
3.0,I would have given 5 stars but the damn thing kept falling off and I do like it wish the magnetic was mr more powerful when cling together.  But I do love it
3.0,"I am pregnant and this is very cute. The top part looks a bit odd if you are bigger chested. Of course, you will wear a shirt under it but it looks slightly odd."
3.0,"This is a really cute cover, but it runs a bit small under the arms and the fabric is scratchy.  I'll still wear it because it's really cute.  Hopefully, it'll soften up after washing."
3.0,We love this shrit. The color is so bright! It looks just like the picture.  The only reason we gave it 3 stars is because it runs BIG. My little one wears a 6/7 and I bought the smallest size they sell. Its to big for her.
3.0,I order the color that looks like faded purple but when i received it the lenses were bright reflective blue mirrors which was a bit upsetting as i did not want something so noticable.
3.0,Does not fit like an extra large in women's.
3.0,"I normally wear a medium, ordered a large after looking at reviews and I would need an XL to feel comfortable in it"
3.0,"This dress is cute, the fabric is soft, the color is very pretty.  But... It was way too short for my 5'4&#34; frame.  It was too sheer--it's one thin layer of white fabric, I'd need a full slip or tank and shorts underneath to not look naked. It was very tight in the chest while the rest fit fine.  It would be perfect as a bathing suit cover-up (had the fit not been so tight in the chest area)."
3.0,Has to be reset each day. Does not run for any long period if not worn all of the time.
3.0,"Fits perfect, but the length is short which is weird since I am short ( only 5'4) so not a dress, it's a top."
3.0,"The leggings are soft and fit just fine but they started ""pilling"" (getting the little balls on them) and look pretty rough after only three washes. Pretty disappointed but they work for chill days at home."
3.0,"Loved the design, however, when actually wearing it, you can only reach the first 2 lines..."
3.0,"The fact that this says tummy control on the description is an actual joke.<br />There is absolutely NO tummy control.<br />This is a soft, comfortable item of clothing, but it is by no means a tummy control short legging. I would be terrified to put my phone in my pocket for fear that my pants would drop. The band at the waist is just as soft and stretchy as the rest of the shorts. The pockets are deep and on both sides, but I wouldn't put anything in them because I don't trust that my pants will stay put.<br />I also wouldn't do squats in these, or what I actually need them to stay for, which is sitting on the floor and getting back up a bunch of times with babies. I don't need to be pulling my pants up with a baby in my arms.<br />Very disappointed, will continue looking but this are definitely getting returned."
3.0,"I debated whether to get this in a L or XL; I'm 5'3&#34;,117 lb., exercise every day, and have never bought anything larger than a Medium in my life! The item description did not match the size chart provided, so I took my chances and went with the L. It arrived today, and I'm going to test it in the pool, but it's very, very tight. Since it took a long time to get here, I'm reluctant to return it, but in retrospect, think it would've been better to go XL (silly, really...). They need to definitely get the sizes aligning with each other on the website, as well as to make sure they understand that Americans who wear a Medium are not likely to go with an X-Large..."
3.0,"Smaller than advertised, I had ordered another dress like and it fit fine but this one was a size smaller than before. The fabric was nice and pretty."
3.0,Works well but didn't adjust right
3.0,Lining is white terry - not what I expected but makes it difficult to get on over a cotton tee.
3.0,"They're okay.... when I first got them, they were a beautiful, milky, clearish white.  Not solid white.  They also felt bigger than 00g, which is the size I ordered, but I got them in.  About a couple months after I got them, one plug became a solid white and the other is still kinda clearish.  Unfortunately they don't look good anymore so I stopped wearing them, but hey, $5!"
3.0,"I know these pants (Halle pant) have a cult following, but I just don't think they all that great. I own these in two colors. I wear a size 0/24, and the 0 in these is enormous. I have to have them hemmed, and I have to tighten the inner drawstring and wear a belt to keep them up. They're not particularly flattering, but I guess compared to all the other extremely unflattering women's hiking/climbing pants out there, they are okay. These definitely look much better on women with curvy figures. All that said, I give them three stars because the style is cute, they are tough and durable, and the color options are nice."
3.0,price was good but the product was not as durable as i had originally thought - but i'm pleased with this product in relation to the price
3.0,"I am normally a medium, but ordered a large because I wanted it to fit looser. It was way too small all over and wouldn't button."
3.0,It‚Äôs a bit short otherwise fits great
3.0,Runs kinda small better suited for kids
3.0,"Ordered a medium and I am usually medium/small. These are small, so order up a size unless you like them tight."
3.0,I love the shirt but it's way to small. I ordered a 2X and it fits more like a Large. My 10 year old is wearing it if that tells you how small it is.
3.0,"The dress is pretty but the skirt starts a bit lower than my waist making it look like it doesn‚Äôt fit right. The top is very pretty, as pictured. If you are looking for a short dress, this is not the one for you. It‚Äôs at the calf which I was a bit disappointed with."
3.0,"Ran small, ordered XXL, I am 5'11&#34; & 250 lbs. Tighter on me than expected for sure. Bought to hold my LVAD controller & batteries which it does well and the extra pockets work great for my cellphone, glasses & insulin pump. If it would have been an actual XXL it would have gotten more than 3 stars."
3.0,Its okay for its price
3.0,It‚Äôs beautiful but doesn‚Äôt stay it‚Äôs keep falling
3.0,"Overall I like these. They run a bit on the larger size. Also... pretty sure the santa/tree pants are supposed to say ""peace"" and ""hope"" but they say ""Nope."" Oops. LOL. My 2.5 year old doesn't know they difference and we get a laugh out of it!!"
3.0,"Very nice, but expensive for a toddler.  Bought as gift-parents could cared less.  Too much money thinking back."
3.0,Looks beautiful and is sturdy enough. But I have some allergic reactions to it. My wrist feels itchy wearing it.
3.0,After two weeks the leather in front started to tear apart and coming out. Not good quality. Belt itself is quite hard material.
3.0,"This is nice looking. But, it is sized very small and fabric doesn't give. size up."
3.0,3 stars since the sizing is inconsistent. I bought two sets of these shorts and one set felt a little bit looser than the 2nd set I bought in the same size.
3.0,"This does not fit my chest (36 DD), so I have not been able to try it on."
3.0,"This looks just like the picture and would have been good, except the beaded part was broken when it arrived. So i just kept the unbroken piece and am looking for a new necklace to put it on."
3.0,Not cotton. Not particularly cool to wear. Very tight. Wouldn't  wear it in public. Super cute though.
3.0,"The material is very thin, so not comparable to baggu. But a good size and well priced."
3.0,I assume that this is called dainty for a reason. The necklace does fit the title. It is a cute layered necklace but it is very fragile. It feels as if I pull it the wrong way that it will break. I will say that it is cute for what it is.
3.0,"Bought this to wear with a beachy loose-fitting dress.  It looks good with it and I've worn it with a T and skirt as well.  But the elastic is giving out after only a few wears and I don't have a huge waist.  Disappointed in that part, but the buckle is a great design and holds very well.  Color is as shown (intense pink).[[ASIN:B00880B1HU 8-shaped Faux Leather Interlock Buckle Stretchy Belt Fuchsia for Ladies]]"
3.0,"It‚Äôs cute and great pattern for the holidays, but mine didn‚Äôt come with the bow on the side or the ties for the back and I‚Äôm a little disappointed (one of the reasons I liked the dress). I see everyone else that has gotten it has a bow and so does the photo. Hmmü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3.0,These tanks aren't super high quality but they are decent for the price.
3.0,"Size is not accurate. It's about one size too small. If you're a Med order a Lrg, if you're a Lrg order an XL, and so on."
3.0,Its not very effecting. It did not work for pinky.
3.0,"In their defense, it's brand new and probably needs some time to stretch out.  I have wide feet anyway, and I *knew* I was not purchasing a wide shoe.  ALSO, the weather is still cold out, so I haven't wanted to wear them much as of yet.  In general, the shoe is very attractive and is exactly what I was hoping for in terms of look.  Once I have worn them more, I will try to remember to update this review.<br /><br />Update: I wore this shoe a lot over the subsequent year and the I wore down both the heel (it started to loose its wedge shape as I wore the rubber sole off) and the front material over the toes started to separate from the base.  Again, I wore this shoe A LOT, so I personally feel I got a good amount of use for the price I payed, but of course no one wants to purchase a new shoe every year."
3.0,"Boots ARE NOT WIDE CALF, NOT WIDE ANYTHING! Shoe is very narrow at the foot. Only reason I gave 3 stars was because I gave them to my friend(not wide calf) who was able to fit them"
3.0,pretty color. had nice comments.
3.0,Bella pero muy grande
3.0,I love the garment it is wearable but too small. It doesn't drap like it should it is too snog..
3.0,This was the second Zeny Pool cleaner I bought. The 1st one was fantastic but fell apart after 1 year but did a marvelous job. I ordered a second one that I never did get  to work so sent it back.  Company was great about taking it back so I would try another Zeny pool cleaner at another time. The price was right....worth trying again....
3.0,La suela es muy suave y se desgasta r√°pido
3.0,Very soft and comfortable. Fades after the first wash though.
3.0,"This shirt looks awesome and is made of good quality material. Having said that, I am swimming in this shirt! I purchased a largw whib isntypocally my size but it fits like an XL, possiby XXL. Not sure if this particular shirt size was mislaveled but I will infortunately not be able to wear the one I purchased. Had it fot properly Iwould have fiven it 5 stars. My suggestion, buy at least one size smaller than you are accustomed to."
3.0,Don't care for the flat links.  Seems pricey compared to what is out there for less
3.0,"Cute top - looks cheap. Arrived much sooner than the estimated delivery date.<br />The white pattern/detail is a shiny silver, unlike what the photo shows. It‚Äôs still cute, but I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it if I had seen it in person in a store."
3.0,"very very thin material...extremely see-through. Usually wear a s/m in compression pants...accidently ordered a large and they fit just fine....a little long, but they fit just fine"
3.0,"Dollar store quality, looks great from far away."
3.0,"They are cute and they fit nice. However the chains arent very secure on the jeans and you will only be able to get one good wear out of them. I would also suggest hand washing the jeans, because these jeans will not survive a wash in a washmachine."
3.0,"OK for costume jewelry, thought it looked a little cheap"
3.0,No pocket??!!! Really no front pocket lol
3.0,"It doesnt have necessary safe guards, but its cute!"
3.0,I like it but it‚Äôs definitely too big on me. I‚Äôm going to get it taken in a bit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and about 120 lbs for reference. I wear a 34B. It‚Äôs a bit loose in the waist and definitely loose around the chest.
3.0,"I like the belt, it needs a simpler buckle than the one I have as the design is very busy. It fits good, is comfortable. Cheers, Susan<br />Artbyssnow.fineartamerica.com"
3.0,"These Panties were too small for me, but I live in a household with my mom, and they fit her perfectly, so we decided to just keep them. They are very nice quality."
3.0,Cute! The quality could be better.
3.0,The color was good and they fit well until they were washed.<br />Next time I would order a larger size.
3.0,Cheaply made but got the job done!
3.0,I expected more from the mask because of its price.
3.0,"It's a nice medium dark brown color. Wouldn't want to wear it over a shoulder for long. I bought it for carrying a small tote bag over the shoulder. The bag carries my 10.5&#34; tablet, keyboard, and overnight things."
3.0,"Thought they'd be fun to try, but they aren't that comfortable and obviously completely revealing.  Can't really see wearing these daily under something, I think they are designed for showing the goods IMO.  Bought medium, still seemed a little loose, but small would probably be too snug between the cheeks.  Worth a try for the fun of it."
3.0,"Love the cover up - but when I opened it, it had hair all over it, cat and maybe a girls long hair, so I had to wash it before I gifted it."
3.0,"Easy to scratch, lens unscrewed from frame within a week, but not hard to fix.  Good size, though"
3.0,"Very tiny.  Not good for long hair because the earrings gets tangled in the hair.  But the earrings are cute and a good value.  These are especially nice for a young girl, I think."
3.0,It shrank worn 1 time
3.0,"Liked the look of this dress, but the cut was strange and didn't fit as expected. Very tight in there bust, which is not usually an issue. Had to return."
3.0,"shipped in a timely matter writing was ok, matched what i payed just wish it would have been more legible"
3.0,"Wide with was just regular, very thin soles with no support. I plan on adding 3/4 length insoles."
3.0,It looks nice and seems fine but as soon as I got it the jewel had broken off. I‚Äôm sure it can just be glued back on.
3.0,"Like I said I like fairies, at first I thought something was missing from her hand I had to look through a magnify glass to see what she was holding. Disappointed."
3.0,Fit well. Will last this summer but will be too worn out to pass on.
3.0,"I got this Isaac Liev Women's Curved Hem Vest for my wife. She's tall and frequently wears open cardigans, buttoned down vests, similar long sweaters.<br /><br />When it arrived, the first thing I noticed is that it's very simple and made of not very great material.<br /><br />She wore it the other day and it looked nice.<br /><br />After washing it today, I noticed a lot of threads hanging from the bottom. These are coming from the stitching at the bottom hem. So that isn't great and I doubt this garment will last very long."
3.0,"I bought these shoes for my wife to wear at a wine tasting. The heel broke on the left shoe broke off after maybe 30 minutes of wear, the majority of time which was spent sitting or standing still.  The heel is glued on reinforced with 3 short screws.  These shoes themselves are stylish, fit well and aside from the heel, appear to be well constructed and of good quality.  I contacted Coach to inform them of the problem I experienced with the heel.  After an exchange of email and submission of several photos they requested to evidence the defect, Coach issued a store credit equal to the retail value of the shoe. Impressive customer service, but unfortunately not an impressive shoe."
3.0,I didn't think I'd be able to swim in the hoodie. I always buy xl this seems more like xxxl.
3.0,"Nice, and the zipper works smoothly, but NOT shaped for a woman's body. I am in no way large breasted, and this jacket pulls from my shoulders to my boobs. It's not too small, mind you, it's just not shaped right. Disappointing..."
3.0,they don't fill like 95 % cotton
3.0,I haven't used it yet.  I bought it for water aerobics @ my gym.  putting it on is tough but it's flattering for the most part. definite support on top.  I have thick legs and I had hoped the shorts were a bit longer.  the leg holes near the crotch are large as well being that the shorts are short.  I'm sure it will work for what I need it.  I'm definitely keeping it
3.0,"I generally wear a size 12 on top and a 14 or 16 on bottom for bathing suits, so I ordered the xxxl (which is to to be a 12-14).  The bottoms fit fine, but the top was much too large.  It wasn't just that the cup area was meant for someone much larger than my meager Bs, but the circumference was also much too big for me.  Very cute suit, but I would need to buy the top several sizes smaller as a separate for it to work for me."
3.0,Pants have a really ugly silver plastic stripe down the side of each leg. You can‚Äôt see it in the pictures online. Returning because of the stripe and also the crotch area is very baggy unless I hike the waist up to my chest.
3.0,The product has defect in one side of the tassel. Slit in one side. Quality control has problem.
3.0,"Nice and light weight pants for hot weather. Belt buckle for included belt is easily "" bumped open"". Good pants, they look like and remind me of Duluth dry on the fly pants, except they make a ""rustle"" noise when moving, and there are less handy little pockets for things."
3.0,My husbands pants ripped after only 1 use
3.0,The pendant stone came off the first time I wore it<br />I haven't worn it much since then.
3.0,"it's ok, nothing special and it is a really good thing that I ordered a bigger size than what I normally wear.  It barely fits"
3.0,"For the price, it's a pretty good deal. But I found these incredibly hard to get in and out, and they were rather sharp. Because I had a hard time closing them, and they were really sharp, my nose was inflamed and hurt for a few days after putting it in (and promptly taking it out).<br /><br />If you're looking for a cheap and cute fix, this is it! But I would recommend only getting if you want to use one and never take it out."
3.0,Not our cup of tea for a face covering.
3.0,This suit is really cute..but if you are busty it a bit small
3.0,"I like the color and the light weight.  My face is not particularly narrow,  though I am a relatively small woman.  This pair of glasses fits me OK for walking and driving, but for sports, I prefer a little tighter fit, so I won't lose it.  When I wear this over my beanie when I xc ski, they stayed OK, though."
3.0,"Not bad, functional  but not what I expected. The fabric... it says nylon and  it doesn't look shiny on pictures. But this nylon seems to be more fitted for a tent/ Iit is kind of  shiny tarp. Also, on the pic you can see the pad fitting  in it - it does...two of them (next to each other). Misled by the pic, I didn't look on measurements...Sturdy, functional. Great for hiking or nature adventure. I wanted it a a purse. Just OK."
3.0,"Womens Sunflower Shirt Crew Neck Graphic Tees Short Sleeve Summer Tops (Green, Small)Womens Sunflower Shirt Crew Neck Graphic Tees Short Sleeve Summer Tops (Green, Small)<br /><br />Is a very cute designed shirt.<br />the material is VERY soft and comfortable, the shirt is lose fitting which is nice in warmer days<br />however I ALWAYS wear a small in shirts, this one is very lose on me and kind of baggy looking."
3.0,Owned for about a month and the black color coating is rubbing off. Otherwise solid product
3.0,You get what you pay for. Some Jewelry come broken. But if you can fix then go for it.
3.0,"It was a cute swimsuit. However, it arrived in a completely different design than I ordered. Also the strings are very very long and we had to end up cutting them to fit well. Also because of the style on the front, if you don't have it tied pretty tightly, you will tend to pop out of the middle occasionally. Not recommended for more busty women."
3.0,The glasses themselves are ok. But for me I kept getting distracted with nose piece. Seller nice so far. If I get full refund from return I will change to a 5 star
3.0,"How about this gift for my best friend. I thought it was very cutesy and the message suited her best. However, I do not believe that this piece is appropriate for a grown woman. The product is very dainty and fragile, not idea for my hard working friend because she's always going, always busy, and this piece will break easily. I would say this product is worth about $3 and would be ideal for a little girl, then you wouldn't be as upset if it broke."
3.0,I usually take LG/XLG. If ordering this get 2XL if you take my size. I had to send back.
3.0,Gave to my wife.
3.0,Average product.
3.0,The yoga pants were ill fitting. Like they kept sliding down. I think it‚Äôs the material at the waist. It‚Äôs very silky. I returned them because they wouldn‚Äôt stay up on my waist.
3.0,"I wish this came in XS.  I am a petite 5""2' and it was too long and baggy on me.  Came down past the knees, minimal chest coverage, and not form fitting.  Dress may not work if you are on the petite side."
3.0,"They look better on the photo then when I got them, they are a lot brighter than expected. Not as cute as I thought they would be. The waist is high so doesn't really work with a belly shirt."
3.0,beautiful earrings but too big for the hole of my ears :(
3.0,Very long on me.  Almost a maxi.
3.0,Worth what I paid for it. Looks nice in my bracelet.
3.0,Large size seems to be a little loose as after riding awhile it rides up. The thigh support band seems kind of weak hold it down.
3.0,The elastic is restrictive around the heals.Can be better.
3.0,"Backlight is uneven. Way too easy to accidentally turn the alarm on. But otherwise OK, and not expensive, so a good value for the money!"
3.0,Looks good but thinner material than expected
3.0,Broke after a month of wearing it
3.0,This necklace is ok but it looks better in the picture than in person.  Disappointed!
3.0,I like it but I ordered one size bigger than my usual one and it still doesn't really fit me.
3.0,"Both pieces are separate, which wasn't a surprise.  Not super high quality but when you spend $40 you have an idea of what you're getting. Was exactly what I thought, although it's not really a winter jacket like its pretends to look like. Really cold temps would be an issue for this."
3.0,The  material was to thin.
3.0,Dropped and they fell apart.
3.0,"Dress is very comfortable and fits perfect for a size 3x, however it totally looks like a hospital gown. I look like I‚Äôve escaped! Don‚Äôt get the light blueish green."
3.0,"The top was a very thin material, I love the picture, but it was not as I was expecting. Also no bust support."
3.0,This is a very pretty ring with nice details as seen in the listing.  Unfortunately it's very flexible and I don't think it should be moving this much.  It bends going on and off my finger.  So even if I adjust it to fit well it's still flexing every time I put it on.  Just doesn't seem very sturdy.
3.0,"Cute dress - but i got the Mint green color, and it's see-through in the skirt area, ill be returning it. The darker colors might not be affected the same way. Maybe you could wear a slip but i personally think its a little form fitting for that."
3.0,"If you are buying this for the cute bangle then it is great, comfortable, and easy to use. I have gotten tons of complements on it. But the the large center stone and two outer stones fell out immediately. I removed the charm and plan on continued use."
3.0,very nice sun glasses love the wrap around but they broke after my husband wore them for only a month.
3.0,"This dress looks so cute but the quality is not great (as expected by price). It‚Äôs completely see through and I would only wear it as a swimsuit cover up. Bottom has an extra layer but barely, top does not. I wear line with bralette or swimsuit.  And it‚Äôs very wrinkly. I ordered a medium. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 150 lbs"
3.0,They have a plastic feel that is not very nice
3.0,Product was ok runs a bit small n the stripe that I thought was read is actually orange
3.0,Got a large that is one size up than i usually get and it was still a bit tight around the waist and bust.
3.0,"I either got a superb copy, or a different model than pictured.  What I received is 14377RNJ201, the &#34;BEA&#34; model which has a yellow tone and grey-brown spray back, The one I thought I was getting and is pictured is Nine West's 10219560, or the &#34;MID&#34; model, which is a warmer brown, with a light tan on the inside of the frames.  I got them well below price, and it's too much of a pain to return, so I will keep them as spares for my vehicles."
3.0,"These are supposed to be a dupe for the Gymshark Training Sweat Shorts and the fit is similar but the inside of the shorts isn‚Äôt fleece, it‚Äôs a scratchy knit material like a backpack or something. Returned"
3.0,"Starting off with the pros.  It's super cute doesn't look as cheap as it cost.  The shipping was even faster than stated.  However if you have any curves this dress is cut straight, so it's not going to being that great.  I measured that longest part of the top before the slit is a little under 6"" and the shortest part is a little under 3.5"".  I don't think I'll really ever be able to wear this comfortably with a portion of nipple showing."
3.0,Sweater runs small. I ususally wear large & ordered large but snug fit.
3.0,"These socks are brightly colored and cute. However, they do not feel like compression socks at all. My daughter says they feel like Normal knee high socks! But she loves them!"
3.0,"The product does not match the color description. I was expecting a yellow and blue skirt as those are my sorority colors, and was very surprised to realize the skirt is orange and blue. I intended to wear it at my regional conference, but I guess I can‚Äôt. Im still giving 3 stars because the garment is quality and I will wear it somewhere, just not to regionals. I was so excited. Oh well."
3.0,"I used them for my monroe. I love the way they look, but the metal part comes off super easy. I've lost all of them."
3.0,"Item arrived late February 2020.  After 1 month of minimal use, item broke.  Customer service not very helpful, no resolution to replace and/or provide partial/full refund.  Most companies would stand behind their products and try to work out a resonable solution, but not this one.  Be weary, not happy with outcome. Item looks nice, but fragile."
3.0,I ordered a 12/14. Received a 3 .  Not happy. Its a beautiful swim suit. But way to big. I need an exchange but can't seem to contact the seller.
3.0,"It was alright, I got these for my boyfriend because he has very sensitive nipples but he wasn't that into the sensation - which is not a fault against the product. The chain is a little bit short and the clamp doesn't get super tight, they are pretty average."
3.0,"THis is NOT for a boy, really girly shirt! But I lOVE the pants"
3.0,A bit small therefore they won't stay up on me :(
3.0,"These are pretty tiny, wish I'd have read the dimensions more carefully if there were any listed."
3.0,"Was not what I expected. The ear pieces are just a sticker. Creased and not flat since ear pieces have a curve.  Thought they would be a heat transfer or something similar, not just a sticker."
3.0,Good for the price. Do not overthighten.
3.0,"Beautiful item, way too small. Based on Asian sizes, not USA. Took a long time to receive, not returnable."
3.0,"Don't get me wrong. Bottoms are great, but I had to give my top away to my smaller chested friend.."
3.0,I did not keep watch because I could not tell because of time needle design are not bright enough to see. Watch seem to be ok.
3.0,"These have been our favorite colored school shoes yet and my son says they are very comfortable. However, I‚Äôm disappointed with the 5th day of school the metal piece where the shoe lace comes through the hole came apart! He doesn‚Äôt tie his shoes tight at all and don‚Äôt see why it should have done that especially after 5 days. Im hoping that it won‚Äôt end up ripping the material down the road because he really loves these shoes!"
3.0,Compre dos y mejor√≥  no es el mejor pero luce bien
3.0,They don't fit my glasses and are very difficult to put on. I have to send both pair back. The are good quality and a good price though.
3.0,"I've been looking for information to contact the seller directly but can't find it.<br />Pros:<br />I love this set of luggage. It is light, large, and cute. The spinner wheels are smooth and work well. They hold a ton of stuff.<br />Cons:<br />The plastic does scratch easily.<br />Super disappointed that the handle on the largest piece broke off first use. Luckily it was after I arrived at my destination and not in the airport."
3.0,I like the material and the way they fit. My only complaint is they are short on me; they end right below my knees instead of half way down my calfs as shown in picture.
3.0,It's a cheap shirt but the quality is still there. I will probably buy more.
3.0,"Nice bag, just too small for my needs"
3.0,Quality of imprints onshirt need improvement.
3.0,Pants fit great and the material is nice. My only complaint is the pockets. They made out of those old swish running suit material. I sound like I‚Äôm running a marathon in an old jogger suit because of the front pockets moving when I walk
3.0,length could be a little longer
3.0,They are just to flimsy
3.0,"Cute dress and has flattering cut. Ordered in blue with white dots and it had a serious fugly color vibe to me. The color and pattern did not look cute. Would reorder in a solid color. The tie strings at neck are really long and odd. Otherwise the dress was a cute fit and flattering. The sleeves are very fluttery on the shorter sleeve version. Fit as expected and a bit of stretch.<br /><br />Edit, tried again to order the dark red color. Hate the texture of the fabric and the fit was completely different with the fabric. There was a weird white mark on the V neck area. Tried twice, no luck with this dress and returning the 2nd one too."
3.0,"Beautiful blouse, just runs way small"
3.0,"They do the job however, very difficult to get on."
3.0,"I love, love this company and their lounge wear. I have bought so many nightgowns and pajamas that it‚Äôs embarrassing. Bought two more sets for my sister. So nice and cool, I feel pretty in them , I‚Äôm a plus size gal and they were very comfortable. But this set was disappointing cause the top was not as long as the others I bought . I‚Äôm a tall gal so I understand that the rest of the world may not like the length. How I wish I could get this short set with the same length as the lounge pj."
3.0,These were bought for a kids birthday party. They were a hit. Make sure you have extras as some break apart easily.
3.0,No battery
3.0,Smaller than I thought and rather heavy for earrings cute for my chicken outfit but can only wear for short time
3.0,"Its really flimsy, but overall it looks good."
3.0,I think if you‚Äôre very thin it would work better. I‚Äôm fit and I have biceps and the arms are really tight around them. The top is very cute otherwise. The bottom is ok but the paper bag style waist isn‚Äôt great so it‚Äôs not super flattering.
3.0,"This is a great tool for removal and/or assembly of watch crystals, bezels and case backs. The only issue with the one I received is the mounting stud on the base of the unit and the press do not match up perfectly - they are about 2mm off center from each other (front to back, not side to side). I did exchange for a different unit. The second unit I received was aligned much better, but looked like it was previously used. I am a bit disappointed, but kept the second unit since the mounting studs matched up.<br /><br />Also, you should know that the Amazon listing is incorrect. This is good news since the original listing for this product only went as small as 24mm and as large as 42mm. The press I received included the following double-sided dies: 18 & 20, 21 & 23, 24 & 26, 28 & 30, 31 & 32, 33 & 34, 36 & 38, 40 & 42, 44 & 46, 48 & 50, flat 25mm and cut-out 45mm<br /><br />The tool was packaged in a plain cardboard box with no markings or labels. Also, no brand name is present on the tool itself. This makes me unsure if it really is a Sumnacon branded tool since all of these watch presses on Amazon look very similar.<br /><br />I give this product a solid 3.5 star rating. It would have been 5 stars if the studs matched up perfectly (or if the second unit I received looked new and unused) and if there was some sort of branding on the box or tool."
3.0,These are a little thiner than I expected.  They are stretchy and a good fit. Will be good for hand and finger mobility.
3.0,"It's okay, it does the job."
3.0,"surprisingly comfy--i'm just not totally sure what to wear them with.  You definitely need to cut on the tag, b/c when you fold down the sides on these, the tag hangs out and looks cheap.  But otherwise they're really cute and comfy--and I'm very picky about shoes.  For the price they're very nice, but I need to figure out how to wear them."
3.0,I was very excited for this shirt and loved the design when I ordere. The shirt fits as expected but the design is completely off centered.
3.0,I ordered a medium in these and found them to still not be flowy enough for me. I'm normally a size 4 in pants and these just didn't feel flattering on me.  They came with a belt but I had not desire or patience to try to loop it through the belt hole.  I'm returning them.  They do not run long and tend to run small.  The waist is elasticized and I found it to fit kind of tight.  The material is okay - I think a rayon/polyester blend?  Just not impressed with them at all.
3.0,"Color is beautiful, a little tight and I thought would be lighter weight."
3.0,It is true to size but.....Gave it 3 stars because after i washed it it started sagging in certain areas. i was soooo upset because it was still new and i never got to wear it. My opinion is it's not worth the money I paid.
3.0,"Material is nice,  fits nicely. Just very bright yellow  not the same color as the picture showed."
3.0,"I received 7 belly button rings instead of the 10 that was described in the description. Also, they aren't all different like I thought, at least one of them is a double so basically I have 6 instead of 10. I gave 3 stars because they are very pretty and I like that I got so many for the price."
3.0,It broke the day we got it but that was mostly due to my 9yr old swinging it around non stop and messing with it constantly.
3.0,They were not big as show on picture.
3.0,"Cute colors, planning to use them as headbands. They are way too loose to use over my face as a mask"
3.0,"Not to shabby, worked for casual wear"
3.0,"The watch is pretty, but the band is not adustable."
3.0,It‚Äôs pretty but it catches on my clothes.
3.0,The material felt nice but the shirt was too short and too wide
3.0,I usually wear a small.  This small was ultra tight
3.0,I ordered 150 strength and received 200 strength.  Disappointed?
3.0,"So I was really excited to receive these leggings since they seem to get so many high reviews, but when I tried them on they were to tight.  I went off the size chart thinking it would fit perfectly...but I should have gone w/my gut & ordered a Medium since that‚Äôs my usual size.  I want to exchange or even get a refund since it‚Äôs shown on here ‚Äú100% Solve your problem.‚Äù  But how would I go about doing that if there is no customer service phone number, email...etc?!  I even asked a question on here...yet no response?!  If it wasn‚Äôt for the size or the customer service...I‚Äôd be satisfied since the material is comfy & the style is on point.  What a waste...I guess I‚Äôll just gift these pants to someone who can fit in them.."
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt work with most of my necklaces. The links on my necklaces are too small
3.0,i was always looking for these glasses and i found them here! i know they have these type of glasses in urban outfitters but their over $20 . well i was so excited to get them & they came in really soon too (: sadly mine were uneven from the middle and were slanted slightly :( but overall they're so cute ! i get a lot of compliments .
3.0,"If it were true to size it would be great, but I ordered according to the sizing chart and it was just far too small. Treated the girls all wrong."
3.0,"Got this for my daughter's Halloween costume. She was so excited she tried it on a few days before Halloween and it started to fall apart.<br />Not a big deal, but I'd definitely expected more for this."
3.0,I have lots of pieces from this brand and this definitely fits smaller
3.0,The straps on the left sandal are looser than the  straps on the right sandal.  Love the sandals just not sure of quality.
3.0,Love the color.  Disappointed in the &#34;off the shoulder&#34;.  I got the impression that the dress was not really designed to be worn off the shoulder but an &#34;afterthought&#34;.  I also thought the dress had a distinctive waist band  to allow the top half to flow freely. Cute dress. Not as excited to wear it now
3.0,"The shirt material is very good, but the fit is snug on the chest area and armpits."
3.0,Not as nice as the picture and a lot smaller than I expected.
3.0,They work well but the back cuts into my lip.
3.0,"The real value is the heated inserts. The gloves aren't super helpful, even tho the Velcro for the little heaters are inside the gloves - I honestly just stick them on the inside of my sleeves to keep warm"
3.0,"Three stars because it‚Äôs very cute and the material is not cheap feeling. However, at<br />5‚Äô 4‚Äù and 158 lbs, I purchased an x-large and it‚Äôs too small on the waist and hip area."
3.0,"Bought these specifically because they are advertised as 5.5 inches. They are actually 5.7. Small difference but it matters.<br />Otherwise, very cute, prints, soft and well packaged."
3.0,"Very pretty dress. Love the lace on the top. Fabric feels nice. Dress seems well made. Because of being larger in bust, I ordered a size larger as I normally do. Unfortunately I still couldn't get the buttons closed. Really was disappointed as I liked this dress. Would be great for smaller women."
3.0,Meh it‚Äôs ok. Thinner than expected.
3.0,"Very poor quality, I would not purchase this item again"
3.0,"it seems like a decent hat, but it's too small for my 4 year old. It really should probably just be called a &#34;baby&#34; hat."
3.0,The fit is okay. The material though is very thin and cheap. More of a swim suit type of material.Okay for working in the yards.
3.0,Hasta ahora bien
3.0,"XL does not fit 38D chest or 43"" hips.  Too small."
3.0,"Cheap plastic, but what else can you expect for the price? Planning on using these for fishing as I usually lose a couple pairs each year anyway. The different lenses will be nice and they are polarized"
3.0,"Los pasadores se rompen muy f√°cil, y el pulso no ajusta adecuadamente, es muy bonito."
3.0,The item looks great but it bent within a few uses. It is not long lasting and I did not feel like I received a good value for this product.
3.0,Very nice but runs a size too small
3.0,It is very pretty to look at. The mechanism works. It is not as &#34;solid&#34; as I thought it would be. The metal is thin so it will not take alot of handling.
3.0,Quality is not great
3.0,"I've been looking for a face mask that maximizes air entering through the fabric, not around the edges.  This mask is not it.  This mask did not let me suck adequate air through the fabric when I held it up to my mouth.  The filter pocket adds yet another unnecessary layer of fabric.  Putting an actual 2.5 pm filter in the pocket would cause suffocation.  The mask has a nose bridge to close the gap at the top of your nose, but the bridge must be shimmied into place before use and may not be apparent to many users.  Size is OK, but possibly too small for a large guy.  The ear loops are adjustable.  Well made, but doesn't work well.  I find the blue and white, 3-ply, disposable masks far better at filtering the air."
3.0,the neckline is not flattering
3.0,"When the bracelet arrived, it was what I had ordered but after close inspection, it looked very cheap. I know the price is not expensive but I know I can definitely get real silver for about 20$. The bracelet is very light, and makes me question whether or not it is indeed real silver. It looks alright but I expected better."
3.0,"I like it, not as wide as it looks"
3.0,"Love the dress, but Runs a little small"
3.0,it looks cheap but it only cost $13 so it is cheap..lol its ok it is decent but not as detailed as the picture...pic must be magnified alot..
3.0,"All I‚Äôd need is a white embroidered name patch with the red outline to complete the gas station look. For me the fit was straight up and down, so with the pockets filled it‚Äôs pretty roly poly. The jacket did have some nice features; zipped pockets etc... for the price I would expect a bit stronger material in the liner. It could be much more feminine, and I usually dress more threatening. I did keep the trench and sweatshirt."
3.0,"The sweater is warm, but scratchy. I have to wear it with a long-sleeve undershirt. The deep grey is even scratchier than the black."
3.0,Cute bag but VERY bright orange. Cute for Summer time.
3.0,This shirt fits true to size and is exactly as pictured in person. The only negative I have to offer is I ordered the white color and it was dirty right out of the package... black and grey smudges all over. Hopefully they‚Äôll wash out but just inconvenient.
3.0,These are super cute but too long and get stuck on my shoulders when I move my head
3.0,The set is very cute. The bottoms fit perfectly. The top to the set was very very small and does not fit at all. My daughter will wear the bottom half but it would of been nice for her to have been able to wear the entire set.
3.0,I like these shorts. They do run small but I just order a size up and it‚Äôs fine. I have previously ordered from a different amazon store but saw these were slightly cheaper. Gray and white stripe came great but the black pair had a hole in it.
3.0,I thought this dress was going to have more structure...it's literally that stretchy fabric leggings or dry-fit shirts are made out of
3.0,Very small but there beautiful !
3.0,The picture looks nicer than what I got. While it was still a decent product I expected more. It was very thin metal and it was larger than I was looking for. But for the price I suppose I shouldn‚Äôt complain too much
3.0,I really like the watch except for one major thing....the clasp is silver while the frame of the watch face is gold. Major oversight if you ask me.
3.0,Super cute pattern. The fabric wasn't exactly what I expected. It's more of a white on white embossed fabric then a plain white. Very cute dress overall.
3.0,Nice top runs larger
3.0,Super comfortable but the camo print is not camo. It‚Äôs just green splotches. Very disappointed.
3.0,not really slouchy
3.0,It‚Äôs nice when it fits
3.0,Great package.. Liked the item until the stones start falling out . Now it's just sitting in a box üòûüòû
3.0,Tight fit.  Rubs under arms raw.
3.0,The bottom is too large
3.0,Wore the shoes about 3 times and they ripped along seam.
3.0,The fit is nice around the arms but not so much a slim fit feeling more of a regular fit.
3.0,"Way too large, looks like a giant beak sticking out. The inside carbon filter is too small to fit the outside shell. The filters that are supposed to let are out do not work properly unless you blow directly into them which you have to press the whole mask really tight to your face in order for it to work. Don't waste your money on these I wore it once and that's all I will wear again."
3.0,It is a good looking bag. Lots of outside straps since it doesn‚Äôt hold much inside. The top straps should have a buckle rather than just a slide adjustable straps. The zippers opened while walking on three occasions. The draw string pouching over the main compartment came apart for no apparent reason.  Im not sure if I‚Äôd trust this bag for more than a day trip initially to make sure it‚Äôs Not going to fall apart and strew ur gear all over the trail.
3.0,Ordered this to.help my husband target his midsection. Washed as directed and it felt as though the internal layer twisted up and then it did not fit right. Before spot washing he enjoyed but it needed cleaned
3.0,Igual a la Fito peroooooooo ..... MUY GRANDE para mi gusto !!!
3.0,It doesn't stay put.
3.0,"The quality is good and material is nice.  Although, Its not true to its size.  Size L is very tight on me.<br />I had to return."
3.0,These have bubbles in them that makes them not smooth on the end of your finger.  Even if you try to smooth it down on your finger it won‚Äôt go smoothly like others that I have purchased in the past.
3.0,It stretches through out the day. Would suggest buying a smaller size.
3.0,returned for size.  Wanted more of a loose sweatshirt effect and this was not oversized enough and it had a very high collar
3.0,"First off, the color (turquoise/brown) was absolutely gorgeous! I got the large and the top section fit pretty good but it was extremely long (even for a Patty top). I'm 5'10&#34; and it still was down to my lower butt. I was going to take it to a dry cleaner and have 2&#34; cut off and hemmed because I really liked the shirt. But then I looked at the back of the shirt in the mirror! There were 4 vertical lines down the back of the shirt. At first I thought they were creases in the shirt from being folded in storage but after a closer look I realized that they were some kind of dye lines. I think (just my guess here) that after the shirt was dyed that it was folded and packaged before it was completely dry. Very disappointing. I returned the shirt with no problems. I'm not sure if I should reorder because I don't know if this was just my shirt or a flaw that will be in more of them. Also I know I would prefer it to be shorter so I would have to pay for alterations since I can't sew."
3.0,"Needs more space in the crotch. Like a cheap hotel,  no ballroom. A fly would help too."
3.0,Great until they brake to fast
3.0,It‚Äôs good very larger  for my liking
3.0,I ordered a small but it was way to0 big around the waist.
3.0,"cute, good quality"
3.0,"It‚Äôs a great little dress, looks just like picture..... but after three washes the threading is coming out.:/ bummer."
3.0,No pockets!! Long shipping
3.0,OK for the price but the springbar pin was low quality and bent. Chains on the band tarnished quickly.
3.0,These shoes slide sideways on your foot causing me to fall at 66 years old.
3.0,"Nice fabric, but for a XXL it is really small."
3.0,These were ordered for my 93 year old Uncle.  I felt the back did not have the height from the crouch to the waist - barely enough material to cover his backside.
3.0,Pretty but small<br />Delivery took forever
3.0,Really small!  Very expensive for what you get.
3.0,The strings come lose very easy but the magnet is super strong overall we love it.
3.0,"case is NOT STAINLESS STEEL, just plated, so if you are ok with that, buy away, but shaky practice on companies part claiming a full stainless case, when it is not."
3.0,"The watch your buying, is actually a quartz movement even though the pictures are an automatic movement. Make sure to read description before purchasing. Buyer error but worth noting. Quality of watch is still decent for $30"
3.0,"2/3 on the earrings. I really enjoy the green pair, I have seen similar pairs in stores for $10 by themselves. The white pair is nice as well. The black pair has a really short tassel, which is not what I was going for. I prefer the drama. It also doesn't' help that the black pair has those horrible cheap looking rhinestones. I will not be wearing them."
3.0,The tassel fell off the second day it arrived and the letters were already smudged when It came in the mail. Other than that it works perfect
3.0,These pins are really cute but be careful because they pull apart at both ends despite being blunt on one end. Before I noticed I managed to put 2 rather largish holes in my jumpsuit plus many other smaller tears. I'll be sure to only use these on my knit and meh shawls since these larger pins won't do any noticeable damage on their own.
3.0,"I liked the product, however, the straps started to stretched after a while and are too big and  I cannot use them.  Also, they are not great for average height people.  With the stretching, they are not usable."
3.0,"The design is pretty, and the gold hardware is nice quality. However, it is mad of pretty cheap quality material. Wish I had gone with a canvas or embroidered strap."
3.0,If I order again I would get a size bigger.
3.0,Material feels cheap. A little scratchy and stiff... The wings had dark print. More BLLLAAACK with THICK LINES instead of a light lines with gray ink like the picture. Over all I would have kept it. Except for the fact that the wings were on the front and back of this shirt. Which I thought was a little strange. Would have liked for them to be on one side.
3.0,Poorly made. They are too small to be a men's xl
3.0,Not water proof at all. Bought for cat grooming business and soaked the whole way through. Cute and nicely made.
3.0,Very thin and more beige/mauve than the off white in the picture. The straps can be challenging to slip in and out of if your upper body and shoulders are not particularly slim. Length of the torso was a little shorter than other comparable rompers so it pulled tight even at 5'6&#34;.
3.0,"Cheap...<br /><br />Decent glasses for a kid, which is what we got them for.  Not recommended for professionals or serious athletes.  Cheap plastic frame, and obviously cheap lenses.  You get what you pay for."
3.0,The fit on this is a little bit awkward. I‚Äôm not used to shoulder tops and I think this will take some time to get used to it. It‚Äôs good quality and a great color.
3.0,"Empire waist falls a little too short. I'm a 44DD so might be a big boob problem only. I would love it if it was a little longer up top because the underbust hem pops up over my boobs. I hate that. Also material is clingy, so you might need a body shaper under it"
3.0,Maybe not for girls with long hair.
3.0,"Fun for a musician. However the fabric is polyester. Sometimes that works, but this fabric looks and feels cheap."
3.0,not a junk but not even average quality strap. chiply made with sintetic leather and sintetic cloth with cheap plastic parts. you get what you paid
3.0,It is made a little small.
3.0,"hese came in a cute envelope with a note from the seller that the design was slightly different from what was pictured, which was true, and that a refund could be obtained if the buyer was not happy with it.  While it was slightly different it was very much like the picture and I am pleased with the purchase.  I would suggest that they put the new design on the website, however, as someone might want exactly what was pictured, but the fact that they made a note was nice.  Also, I have to put a safety pin through the back hole for the rod of the earring to go through, it was very tight before, but after doing this several times, the earring fit.  They should modify the design to accommodate the size of the earring."
3.0,"great for price paid. flashlight is pretty much worthless for its intended use to be able to see where you are walking, but good to have just in case you need it in a pinch to look for keys etc. in the dark."
3.0,"Red,White and &#34;gray&#34;  Reduces glare on windshield. Eagle Eyes much better. Eliminates glare and I can see much better."
3.0,"Based on other reviews, I thought these would be good to wear around the house without shoes - however, they are just too small.  I think they were a one size fits all - if so - surprise - as in most one size fits all - they don't.  They are cute and I'm sending them to my daughter who wears a half size smaller shoe.  They may fit her fine.  For quality, I would rate it a 5, but for size, I can only give it a 3."
3.0,I liked the fit and how it looked on me.
3.0,Runs an entire size small
3.0,"I thought I could wear these, technically, I have a men's size eight foot, and the woman's tend to be a bit too snug after wash and wear.  These are listed as running from men's size 6-11. If I were an eight, they should fit, right? Wrong. Way to big. Gave them to a guy friend.<br /><br />I do love this brand of socks and have happily worn the woman's Gentle Grips for several years. Will return to ordering these great socks in Women's SIzes from now on."
3.0,"I had to return this.  We decided we did not like the color.  It was made nicely and seemed sturdy, but we never used it."
3.0,"good material, just dont wash"
3.0,It fit but was a little bit small than what the size said it would be.
3.0,I‚Äôm small 5‚Äù 106 lbs and they are big on me hope this helps small petite women
3.0,Great product except runs pretty small.  Bought XL was too small for a kid that typically wears L
3.0,Ok nothing special
3.0,a little disappointed by the frailness of it. not as substantial as the photo shows.
3.0,These were great until I washed them<br />Lots of wrinkles.  Looks terrible now and I don‚Äôt think it will be easy to iron.  Other hats I‚Äôve purchased were wrinkle free.
3.0,it is a watch of medium accracey
3.0,"This dress fits great, but I've been having trouble with the zipper. The zipper tends to get stuck midway up/down. The first and only time I wore the dress my husband had to help me because I needed to use my hands to hold the top part of the zipper closed while he zipped it up."
3.0,Runs small and I can‚Äôt pull them over my elbow. Works okay though
3.0,"It's a little heavy, but useful for what I need."
3.0,"LUV the look but the ball did not come off. Tried all of them. My son did also. Still using, just putting jewels on differentlyüòî"
3.0,very pretty but the top clamp hurts your ears:(
3.0,It's OK.  Nothing special.
3.0,Really cute with jeans but huge . iI ended up taking it in to fit better
3.0,They are lovely but larger than I expected.  Still a great price for lovely pieces
3.0,A little bit short at 8 1/2 in.
3.0,Not good quality material.  After two washings the material started to get &#34;pills&#34; (little fuzz balls) up and down the legs.
3.0,Would have given a 5 star but the part where the stone is doesnt sit well on my neck. It keeps tilting backward.
3.0,Very soft and comfy.  Very clingy and shoes every curve and bump.
3.0,To long and i am 5'5
3.0,Unfortunately this arrived after promised.  Had to return.  Seems nice though
3.0,"It's beautiful,  but it on for a couple of days the butterflies came off."
3.0,"I thought these were the same brand/style of headbands I had purchased previously, which I like a lot. The colors are great, but they are super thin. The kind I bought before were nice and thick, but these are kinda flimsy. I have yet to use them, so I can't comment on their ability to absorb sweat or to hold up to wear and tear, but it seems like they might come apart rather quickly compared to thicker bands."
3.0,I use them for cycling and skiing. They are not as warm as I hoped. For skiing I use them underneath another pair of gloves and they at least keep my hands dry. I bought a medium and they fit well. The zipper seems a bit tight to close on my wrist. For the price I can't complain. The small opening at the seam can easily be stitched.
3.0,"No denying these are fun, awesome shoes. They look cute and the lights have been working fine with no glitches (make sure they are fully charged!). However, the USB charging port is right at the top of the shoe and my daughter complains that it hurts her feet when she wears them all day. I tell her to keep the shoe tongue tucked under the port, which she says helps a little. Wish there was a better, more comfortable placement of the port!"
3.0,"This dress is very comfortable. The material a little thin and almost see through.  I would suggest undergarments that don't show all of the lumps and bumps. The dress is more red than purple like the picture.  Overall, it's a fun dress. Great for the price."
3.0,Way too expensive for a cheap toy
3.0,"They are soft and cute, but seem a wee bit short in length, and very snug around ankle. My grand son is average in size so snug fit around ankle not because of chubby feet."
3.0,"Very lightweight, son says not the most comfortable. So they're fine for the money to trash when playing outside"
3.0,"I found the skirt to not be as described in the reviews. Was looking for a skirt just above the knee. 5‚Äô7‚Äù person said it fit just above the knee. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and it was way too short so I am returning it. If you are looking for a short skirt, then you would most likely really like it. The belt was a nice feature also."
3.0,"I love the comfortability of the dress, but it was a little too short."
3.0,I had a great time wearing them for a change
3.0,Hard to answer how the product fits because it's just not proportional.  I had to return it. It is very large on top and can't be tightened enough to make a difference. It's very tight through waist and hips. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because the color was so so pretty. A d the pattern of the sequens was lovely. But o just can't imagine who would fit these proportions (and also not need bra support).
3.0,"It was pretty good. The fabric is not the best quality, mine ripped after a day.."
3.0,"I love these designs, and when I finally receive it in the mail, I will tell you how pretty it is."
3.0,"I have been looking for an emerald green dress for a couple of years, but no luck! When I saw this picture, I thought it was exactly what I wanted! The style is nice, the color is perfect (exactly the color I wanted), it fits nicely and looks just like the picture. It is sewed and finished very well. HOWEVER, the fabric it is made of is very strange! It is very stretchy (which is not necessarily bad), but it feels like a tarp. I don't think this material was intended to make clothing. It's almost rubbery and will most likely be very warm/hot to wear. I'm not quite sure what this fabric was intended for, but I'm sure it wasn't intended for a dress. Possibly, some kind of workout wear, but the rubbery quality and non-breathability of the fabric would not be ideal for workout wear either. I have not tried washing it yet, but will certainly do so before wearing, since it was made in China. The bust area of the dress is lined with satin/satin-like material. The back has an invisible zipper. I debated about returning it, but I've had such a hard time finding what I wanted, I decided to keep it & give it a try. If it was made out of an appropriate fabric for clothing, I would give it 5 stars. I did read all the other reviews before purchasing, and many people liked this fabric, but I don't. See photo of fabric content. 64% COTTON, 32% NYLON, 4% SPANDEX‚Äîshould be pretty warm wearing this dress, not good."
3.0,"It is just as pictured, but the sizing is a little off. NOT FOR SMALL BUSTED WOMEN! Even though I ordered XS, it is still slightly big for 32A/32B/34A (even though the sizing chart says it should fit). I am 5'3 and 113lbs for reference!"
3.0,The sizes need to be adjusted. The xxl size pants were medium at best. Otherwise the pants would be great. üôÅ
3.0,"Doesn't smell bad honestly, it perks up well too. Doesn't sag down or anything. Although the eye holes are to low and very hard to wear comfortably and the way it should be. Otherwise everyone loves it! Myself included!"
3.0,It is too baggy in the front and hangs weird.
3.0,The closing system isn't that good. I like the pendant so I plan to put it on a leather necklace
3.0,"A few things...Of course I had to get this for lounging due to the fact it had one of my favs to do; drink wine!<br />They fit per the size chart guidelines, bit after wearing for a couple of days they annoyed me because there were no pockets nor a flap, as I have to pee often from drinking lots of water daily, for these reasons I would not recommend."
3.0,Beautiful robe but the one I received fit more like a 12/14 in the the XL.
3.0,"The color of the blouse is very nice and vibrant, but that's about it.  The material is like a cheap very harsh material. The fit was horrid with bust darts that run from under the arm pit to the middle of my chest. Maybe it was all because of the fit, but it was not flattering at all. I bought 2 and both are going back pronot."
3.0,The only issue I have with the boats is that the right boat is more square and the left boat is more round.
3.0,"The tunic is as colorful and vibrant as depicted. It is not oversized, but rather undersized. I was hoping for an oversized draped look, but instead it is form fitting. I like the product, but would order a size larger in future for an oversized versus form fitting look."
3.0,This came today in the mail and it‚Äôs missing one of the locks in the gold of 4. So it‚Äôs a bummer because I only use gold necklace and now I can only wear 3 at the same time
3.0,These were cute but they were larger then I was expecting.  Too big for my 12 year old daughter.
3.0,Couldn't even fasten it.  Very disappointed because otherwise they seemed great!
3.0,Love this...very comfortable..a tad thin..great as a dress or as a top with leggings
3.0,Exactly as pictured but too small and short! My butt hangs out :(
3.0,Material thinner than I thought would be
3.0,Great shirt esp for a UNLV & Star Wars fan - Go Rebels.  Length was good but wish it was a slimmer fit - kind of boxy.
3.0,I loved the zipper front bras until they started becoming unzipped when I wore them. I don't understand why I've thrown one out. Other than that they're wonderful
3.0,Its ok - but isn't as dainty as it looks in pics.
3.0,Buy bigger size than usual.
3.0,Made in a style to be kind of breezy billowy but it's really too big.  Too much extra fabric to gather.<br /><br />Love how adjustable it all is with the straps.  You can really customize how deep a v the front is and how tightly gathered the back is. (all one strap that ties together)
3.0,they don't stay on very long :(
3.0,"I love them, but they're assembled backward. Their wings, though lovely, should not face forward. They're terrifying, not playing hide and seek."
3.0,It is what it is. It's advertised as rough cut. The one I got was rougher than expected and I should have sent it back.
3.0,This is waayyy more gentle than i thought it was gonna be.. you have to really try to make it sting even a little..
3.0,"cheap material, the dress tore right before the wedding, i had to go out a buy something else."
3.0,"The shirt was really cute and I like that it's form fitting, but it's way shorter than I was expecting. I'm 5'9 and usually wear larges, so that is the size I ordered. I like to wear high waisted jeans and tuck my shirts in, but as you can see from the photo this shirt was too short to tuck in."
3.0,These are very pretty but tight on the toes. I'm a size 9 (39)
3.0,"This blouse is very pretty, but it fits very oddly. I'm a tall woman and have a problem with tops being too short, but this one is wide and short."
3.0,Looks like costume jewelry.
3.0,Wasn't really thrilled with these. Bigger than expected and they darken over time.
3.0,"It's ok, bigger than I really wanted. Like the look of it."
3.0,"Pros: The color s of these are deep and don't seem to fade. And, the material is sturdy and strong. It seems that it will hold up to serious gym-time and washing.<br /><br />CONS: I have a 30inch waist and ordered the 32. (Why? Because I have a very athletic build and wanted to ensure room for movement around my quads when working out)  These are different than any other 3/4 shorts I own as they are quite snug around the waist but really loose around the upper calf area. I mean they are strangely loose when compared to the other 3/4 Fuskunoie shorts I own. (they do no fit the same way as the photo shopped image in the listing)<br /><br />I recommend going a size up for the waist and never skipping leg day!"
3.0,Good size and comfortable to wear. Zippers are clunky.
3.0,"For me, I hope it lasts the silver color."
3.0,"This top is thin but comfy .. the back hem is long and the back pockets sag with any amount of weight in them .  My husband riding behind me said it looked ""funny""  I liked the coolness of the material .. I will wear for short rides only"
3.0,"Item received is different than what is advertised. The graphic on the back is not the same and the blue is not nearly as vivid. As another reviewer stated there‚Äôs also lots of pilling on the inside and pockets. I ordered a large after purchasing another North Face zip hoodie of the same size that fit perfectly. This seems to runs bigger, but more like I would expect a large to fit. That being said, a medium would have been better for my comfort, I don‚Äôt plan on layering much under it.  Haven‚Äôt decided if I will be returning yet."
3.0,I'm a size 2 with a curvy shape. I wish I had more room. I felt a little like a pig in a blanket. My husband liked it but I didn't
3.0,"The color is very close to the picture.<br /> The small clasp in the back was too<br />Tight & felt uncomfortable. I purchased the same size I wear  in  a bra.<br />Unfortunately,  I have to return it."
3.0,Doesn't stand up to professional use very well. But just fine for the home
3.0,"My pack only had 3, I did not receive the one with a shell. They are really hard and I find them uncomfortable to wear. The colors are okay, no complaints with that. The straps are extremely long and I may attempt to trim them down, but the flip side to that is that they can be useful at many sizes."
3.0,Getting the product was fine.  It did the costume good.
3.0,Hard to read unless lit
3.0,Looks good & fit well
3.0,I got a triple X but it is a actual large in size.  XL tops.<br />I love the design and how it looks just wish they had the sizing right
3.0,"Huge, but is cute when styled correctly"
3.0,"As soon as I took it out of the package the ""stone"" fell off.  I am going to fix it with some epoxy at work tomorrow, but very disappointed in the overall quality.  I am still giving 3 stars because I will still wear this after I have mended it."
3.0,"If I didn't find better pairs, I would keep these. They are truly high rising, snug but fit okay, and are a thick non-see through material. they have good deep pockets and look flattering. I just didn't like how immobile and rough the fabric was. Plus the ankles were not completely tight to my ankle/calf."
3.0,"Super thin material, almost see through"
3.0,I am disappointed it arrived with the icecream falling off the shoes
3.0,Poor quality band. It broke after only a month. I can't replace it without a tool and I'm afraid ill lose the pins!
3.0,Arm holes are tiny. Its long and fits a little weird but will suit it's purpose for beach wear.
3.0,"I've ordered other sunglasses from them, for some reason these feel a little &#34;cheaper&#34; and more brittle than the ones I ordered before. Still not bad for having a pair set of cheap sunglasses lying around."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt work with my older g shock. Seemed like it would have been a decent band.
3.0,this is a beautiful watch and it runs VERY smooth ... i cant do a full review because it is a gift ... i am sure she will love it but you all need to wait lol
3.0,"Would love if they were smaller, they look huge. Not the best for actual sun use but makes you look fashionable."
3.0,"Slow shipping from china. Size runs a bit small. Thin material. But it fits. Not perfect, just fits. 5'5&#34; 140 lbs. ordered a Med."
3.0,"Well-made but sizing is waaaay off. I have larger calves, but not outlandishly so ‚Äî I'm 5'4"" and 150 ‚Äî and I was in so much pain on the plane I had to take these off and toss them altogether. Would buy the extra large next time"
3.0,not as small as described should have gotten the large not XL other than that great shirt
3.0,I returned due to being too tight across the top of my daughters chubby little feet. Cute mermaid graphic and soft material
3.0,Bought 10 only revived 9
3.0,"OK for hanging out at home or the post workout, post shower trip home from the gym. Not supportive enough to work out in if you want your girls to move when you do, but very comfortably constructed. Four stars on overall, but only 3 because I thought the price slightly high for the four stars overall."
3.0,"This is a great pullover however, this pullover is not true to size.  A 3XL fits very loosely on me, but this pullover, 3XL, fit very snug."
3.0,Surprisingly for the money this dress is amazing.  It was not packaged well at all.  I‚Äôve bought less expensive dresses and had them<br />Packaged much better that thrown together.  I was surprised at how it held up in the Package.  It is true to size.
3.0,"Mine was blue and turquoise with two ovals in pink and turquoise.  That did not work for the outfit I intended so I had to return it.  However, if you need a necklace in those colors, it would be nice."
3.0,It wasn‚Äôt as long as the pictures but it‚Äôs still a nice sweater
3.0,"Love the color,however a bit cheap looking for price paid. Writing is more of a screen print(?). Almost as if it could be peeled off shirt."
3.0,Way too big. 5 foot. 110 lbs and 20 weeks pregnant and the small was huge. Even with heels on the length was way too long. And the chest area was just too big. Nothing I could do to make it work sadly.
3.0,"I didn't like the wallet because it did not match the purse I had bought, so I ordered the small wallet directly from Guess instead, but overall a nice product. I will order other items in the near future!"
3.0,This is a dark gray shirt not a black shirt which is advertised on the page. I'm returning it.
3.0,cheaply made and the tail doesn't reach to the top of the ear and no I don't have big ears lol
3.0,Not tall girl friendly
3.0,"Well, the fit was great. It fit exactly as expected. I have a tall skinny almost 5 yr old. I got a size 6, and it fit great. The only negative is that the fabric started getting fuzzy after one wear!! We were at an indoor pool. She did not sit anywhere or slide into the pool on her butt. There was not scratchy concrete anywhere anyways, because it was an indoor pool with smooth surfaces. I just don't understand why it would do this after one wear. I attached pictures."
3.0,"It's very cute, however, the hat doesn't fit very well. On one hand it's a little small, on the other it's too long."
3.0,Not bad for the price but these fell apart pretty quickly.  I would recommend to get one authentic fit bit band over these as they hold up better.
3.0,Very good looking well made sandal but way too small. Returned.
3.0,Not as described. The rose hue is slight .Almost not noticeable.
3.0,There is no shape to the dress like it has in the picture.  Kind of boxy looking.
3.0,"Adorable moccasins, but some came unglued after a month of wearing them."
3.0,Found these to be too long in the front. Needed to return.
3.0,"Though the description is fairly accurate and the photograph on Amazon's product page is attractive, in ""real life"" (according to my wife for whom I ordered it) this hat is a disappointment.<br /><br />Here is what she says:<br /><br />The wool is of mediocre quality<br /><br />The band's ""velvet"" is also of mediocre quality and it is not even attached to the hat (meaning that it will ride up as one wears it). I'll probably have to stitch it to the hat.<br /><br />The ""one size fits most"" is not accurate in my case; I will have to put some Velcro into it in order for it to fit properly.<br /><br />It is good-looking and, I suppose that, at the price, it's a reasonable value.<br /><br />I'll wear it until it falls apart and then I'll just discard it.<br /><br />I can't say that I'll miss it when it does ""go.""<br /><br />All in all, a disappointment, especially in view of the fact that most other Amazon products we have ordered previously have been of excellent quality and great values.<br /><br />Too bad ..."
3.0,My husband bought me this as a gift i loved it but the chain is very fragile and broke.
3.0,"It came bended but I think is amazon's fault because it was incorrectly packed, on the other hand concerns me as well the fact that it bends really easy :)"
3.0,"I ordered the berry color and was disappointed because the fabric looks cheap. I know it wasn't very expensive, but this is the first Amazon clothing purchase that I will keep for ""at home only"" apparel. FYI - the fit was true to size and the armholes didn't hang low enough to expose my bra. Perhaps a different color would look better??"
3.0,The actual sweatshirts are fine but the print on theses sweatshirts is not the quality I expected. I am disappointed. I feel like I could have gotten better quality from someone that had a vinyl machine at home.
3.0,Tighter than expected. Not something I‚Äôd pay this much for.
3.0,Cheaply Made Hat tore off face as soon as tried to put on
3.0,Fabric a lil thin and true to size. I ordered med and it looks small but its stretching fabric fits true to size...very sexy dress! Need a nice body as it shows every curves...
3.0,I wish it will be tight on the bottom legs
3.0,"Be careful washing it, it will shrink..."
3.0,"Loved it but little too tight, returned"
3.0,It was cheaply made and the print was okay! Kinda what you'd expect from the price.
3.0,"Size chart is inaccurate causing you to pick a size too big. Please simplify you size description. It‚Äôs deceptive and would cause you to blame the consumer for ‚Äú picking ‚Äú the wrong size. Otherwise I like the feel of the material. But still sending it back.  Looks wise it is what I wanted, size wise it is not.. just be careful picking the size.  US S is really more like a large, that‚Äôs a big difference for someone my size"
3.0,"Not as comfortable as I was hoping for, but improvement over the original ones."
3.0,When I got this watch I was hoping maybe for it to be high quality well that wasn‚Äôt the case it felt like plastic the tool that takes out the pins broke I wouldn‚Äôt recommend but as we know you get what you pay for.
3.0,"This product arrived quickly and as shown, but sadly did not fit. I got the biggest size and the length was quite short. Would only work well for mord petite frames. Material was soft too. Sadly, had to return due to being way too small."
3.0,I bought this necklace for prom. It is very cute and  dainty  But comes undone very easily. Not only that but and hour into wearing it broke. Maybe I just got a default chain.
3.0,Winter wear. Thick material<br /><br />I have chunky and short ish legs<br />I got a large in these so they‚Äôd fit comfortably around my legs but couldn‚Äôt get it past my calves
3.0,"Cute romper.  However, when I tried it on, the shoulders were a little too far apart.  Luckily, my mom is a seamstress.  When she took out the seams, she noticed that not only did they sew unevenly and sloppy, but also, one side was shorter than the other.  She had to cut and re-sew the whole shoulder/neck part.  Cute, but will not be wearing it again after one time."
3.0,I know I don't look like the typical bike rider because I wear 2x for shirts and I have a 36 inch waist. The shorts are ok but the shirt was so small I gave it to my 13 yr old soon who is about 140 lbs and it fits him fine as far as the quality it's no worse than any of the riding shorts I own but definitely not any better wish the shirt was cut for American not some small Framed guy from Europe or Asia.
3.0,Not too excited about the ventilation design that is constructed with mesh inserts. It looks silly and probably is not durable either. The much better design would be covered mesh like on Air Strip shirts. The other features are typical ExOfficio quality. I am not sure yet if I'll Ikeep the shirt or send it back.
3.0,Very cute swimsuit for $6.99. Top was slightly loose. Definitely do not wear to a water park unless you want your chichi‚Äôs on display.<br />Typically I purchase a size small and got this in a medium. Will say it fit like a medium. The price was worth it for the bottoms which I use with other swimsuit tops.
3.0,Nice shoe but too narrow
3.0,"The feel of the material is not soft or rough. The fabric design has a nice pattern and cute. After reading some of the reviews regarding sizing up I did size 2 sizes. I would usually wear a regular US medium and went two sizes up and it fit perfectly for me.<br />I think the material of the swimsuit is ok and would have been nice  and a decent swimsuit if one incident didn't happen. The swimsuit is clip together in the back by two little pieces of metal that overlap each other. With the one that I received one of the metal clip has gotten loose, which means that the stitching/sewing thread got loose therefore cause it to got loose. The stitching quality is lousy with the one I received. I will have to stitch it back together which is an inconvenient for someone who doesn't sew nor good at it. Please note that I did received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion."
3.0,you would be better buying one from Smokey Mountain Knife works that come with a fold out knife for boxes!
3.0,"I gave this sweater a 3 star rating because the size runs too small.  The dress though, is very nice. The color that I ordered is exactly what is shown."
3.0,"It completed my outfit. Loved that it came with the tool to adjust size. It took a while but I figured it out. I love this masculine watch, so big, so blingy. Only thing I didn't care for was that the top and band are 2 different color golds. The band is more of a bronze gold which makes it look fake. Overall it did the job for my night out."
3.0,"I read the reviews on how it fits much smaller so I decided to get an XL. I am 5'2 and 120 lbs, it fit me perfect. The only thing that bothered me was that the material is cheap and see through."
3.0,"It look about 6 weeks to get the shoes because they were lost in shipping the first time. Quality is not the best, but the kids love them!"
3.0,"This is very thin, almost see through.  It is cute and will serve its function, but it is a little small.  Luckily, I don't need to button it.  I live in FL so the fact that it is lightweight is a plus."
3.0,I like the overalll dress.. but it has pockets (which I love) but I had to pin them together underneath the dress of not it looked like I had bat wings..
3.0,"Good value for the money, good protection for glasses. However one doesn't close properly."
3.0,"These are very wide. The material is thin, which isn‚Äôt bad for being in the Arizona heat. The bottoms are good enough to walk on the sidewalk outside. The material didn‚Äôt hold up well in the river we played in. They slip off easily while swimming."
3.0,"Nice shirt, love the softness of the fabric, but too large for my frame -- the gathers in the chest hit all wrong, I would need a petite and/or an extra small."
3.0,The turtle keeps falling off because I think she too heavy.
3.0,"I bought two necklaces like this, two different brands. This one was the least favorite. Still cute, inexpensive, but the clarity of the material with the suspended dandelion had some residue causing it to not be as clear as the other brand. The dandelion piece also wasn't laying as nicely.<br />Still a good necklace and dont regret buying it."
3.0,"I wish the sleeves were smaller bc it makes the dress so puffy, its so cute outside of that. Order 1 size smaller"
3.0,Definitely a great product if you wear a outer vest for work. Only thing is the velcro on the straps pretty much disintigrated after 6 months of use. Would suggest the company use a higher grade (if that's even a thing.)
3.0,Took a long time to come in. Said they fit a size 12 but they fit my child that wears an 8 perfectly ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3.0,"They're warm and comfortable. My complaint is mainly that the stitching for the left mitten's lining has already come loose, and I've only had these about a week. :/"
3.0,"It‚Äôs a fine belt if you are not expecting to wear it often.  I do like the flipping belt head, that is quite neat.  But mine is already starting to wear out pretty fast.  It‚Äôs not that thick of a leather belt."
3.0,Love to structure
3.0,I am not reviewing the company they shipped as expected but the shoes themselves were odd. They were really really roomie but not in the way you think like in length. It was in height inside The shoes. They could fit two small feet on top of each other. The set were like this so she couldn‚Äôt wear them. They would have been super cute if they fit the foot right. They were just weirdly made.
3.0,Such a cute romper. The romper is well made however it was just a bit too small. I couldnt zip it all the way up. I tend to be wide through the back and that is sometimes a problem for me.
3.0,These bags are flimsy but so far I haven't had any break. I doubled up on them when I had several cans and jars to carry. I like the different sizes.
3.0,"I got these to work out in. They run small and short, and the material is thin and cheap. I would not order again."
3.0,"Cute, but top slightly big, bottoms tiny. I am more pear shaped...so"
3.0,The trunk was not real comfortable for me.  I much prefer my saxx boxer briefs.  I will stick with them for now.
3.0,Made with a spandex material with a horrible smell to it. Fits you tight.
3.0,I bought my size according to the chart but due to how the material fits it makes you look bigger and not in the good ways. Order a size down if possible. I wish I had ordered a S instead of a M because it was $20 wasted :/ but it would have been cute if I had gotten the right size
3.0,I dislike how it is soo big !<br />This runs  huge.
3.0,Looks cheap but cute from a distance!!
3.0,"I got this for Christmas. I just had the ""sticker"" that has the redwings logo on it fall off, and the ring holding the logo on it has turned red."
3.0,Haven't really seen much difference this has made for my boot in terms of the protection of my boots/leather. I guess I will tell by the end of the winter . It definitely  keep it shine and clean
3.0,"They ripped by the zipper while I was at work! The fit is perfect, but this is a quality issue. I made it through the day with ductape holding the tare together on the inside of my pants. This is after only two washes.<br />Normally, my Levi's last a year or two and rip at the corners of the rear pocket. (and that's surprising because I suffer from noassatall). I guess this time is a case of being all meat and no taters.<br />Really wish I could get a replacement üòï"
3.0,Easy to bend
3.0,Enjoyed the lightness of the material but its tight around your face so when I inhale the material goes into my nostrils which makes it very difficult to breath. Think it would be great for a bandanna or other function just not over your nose.
3.0,These shorts were shorter than we thought they would be. Also only the back pocket and one side pocket had a zipper and the pockets are pretty shallow and my phone doesn't even fit in them.
3.0,Ok shirt. Do not expect expert tailoring
3.0,"Did not like the fact that the gems started falling off after first wear and left ""rip"" marks on the shoe where the gems were."
3.0,"Nice watch for my teenager, but very hard to remove a couple links to help it fit correctly. Fought long and hard to get the pins  back in after getting links out."
3.0,these run small
3.0,I got 2 versions.... the yellow polka-dot one has a longer torso via the ruffle... the white floral was shorter due to the shorter ruffle
3.0,The earrings are very cute but seem to be very easy to break. We have a set that arrived already broken and they just happened to be my daughters favorite. :(
3.0,very happy i purchased this product.  just wish they were larger
3.0,"Definitely cute and comfy!  I am only 5'5"" and the bust line seam was up a bit too high so it looked a bit funky but overall I love it!"
3.0,"It‚Äôs ok, soft and good fit but you can see right through the white so you have to wear a tank under."
3.0,Cute but is very long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù1 and it comes down mid calf
3.0,"It's not near as long as the pictures but still really cute. There are slits up the sides, material is sheer. I feel like it makes my shoulders look a little broad but will be cute with a white or purple shirt underneath. I don't think I would buy it if I seen it at the store but I'm keeping it and I'll definitely wear it"
3.0,didn't love it or hate it. looked good for my Han Solo Costume
3.0,Dress was too short...fast shipping though
3.0,Looks nicer on the ad seems a bit cheap
3.0,"I have both these and a pair with individual toes.  I find that my feet slip inside of these socks making some poses/ movements a little more difficult.  I have bad knees so slipping can sometimes be painfull.  The socks with individual toes do not slip, and I prefer those.  However, as general socks to where on a slippery floor, they work well."
3.0,The straps broke the first time I wore it. Sad because it was very sexy.
3.0,"The picture definitely does more justice than the real thing. The shirt is much more faded than the images on the product page give it credit for, and the material reminds me of the free blankets you get on airplanes. Wouldn't buy again"
3.0,Looks just like the photo except instead of it being tan mine is pink. Also my key slips out of it so I just have it as a keychain
3.0,"I guess you get what you pay for.  While cute the item arrived without the sash, and one of the pocket's entry was cut almost too small to get my hand into.  In addition there was a hole in the pocket, where it was obvious the material was not meeting during the stitching."
3.0,My children are beyond excited about these shoes!! But one shoe in each of their pair turns on automatically and makes my children upset as they can't wear them to school if the light function doesn't properly work. Super disappointed about that
3.0,Had to return because the lights stopped working within 2/3 wears.
3.0,I purchased 3 others colors and I love them. I bought the green with the ‚Äúsatin‚Äù puff sleeves and I regret it because it looks cheap. I may return it.
3.0,Not bad. Proportions are way off width wise in chest area. Design printed alright
3.0,"These pants (pink ones) are gorgeous and flattering! I‚Äôm 5 ft flat and the pants fit great in length. The down side...I went with the measurements and comments but the medium is a little too snug around my stomach/torso area. I weigh 127, 5ft, waist is 36 inches and hips are 38 inches. The medium was tight around my torso/ stomach area. I think the large would have been better but still looks alright. I will just wear big t-shirts to hide my muffin top I get more in shape."
3.0,"I always wear an xl in this style of dress, and this was not sized correctly.  It was so tight in the top and waist.  I will reorder because the fabric is nice, but there isn't a lot of ""give"" to the fabric.  Definitely give it a try, but order two sizes up."
3.0,"These look pretty nice.  I really like that the order comes with two keychains.  However, I wish there had been some kind of indication that the packaging had a cardboard backing saying &#34;Bai He Feng&#34; and &#34;i love you&#34; (see picture).  I bought these as a gift for my brother-in-law and I'm kind of unsure of what to do with them now since I don't want to open the package but I also don't want to declare love for him..."
3.0,Got it in the mail tried it on instantly and fell<br />In love. I purchased this for vacation. While I was getting ready my friend noticed that there were two holes one on each shoulder! I was so upset! I wanted to give it a 5 it was perfect length and matches the picture to a T I just wish the quality was better
3.0,does not fit to small for wrist
3.0,button keep opening
3.0,So cute but did not fit. ran bigger
3.0,"Definitely runs too small.  I usually wear a 12.  I saw a review that said that it runs small, so I erred on the side of caution and bought the XL instead of the L.  Still, it was pretty tight. I won't send it back because it came in a vacuum-packed inner envelope so, sending it back would be like stuffing a 10 pound baloney in a 5 pound bag. One other issue was that it smelled horribly of smoke? Seriously?  I let it air out a few days and sprayed it down with Fabreeze. Still, it seems to be well made, warm and I have to keep it. I will give it 3 stars for its construction, but I would caution that when buying from China manufacturers to check the sizing reviews.  I'm considered to be on the larger side of average here in the states but apparently by Chinese standards would be considered obese."
3.0,"Was alright. Beautiful stone...but it broke in half after a few weeks. The small stones however kept trying to fall off and come unglued. I put two back on myself, but lost one when I was only god knows where. Good product, but needs a but of work."
3.0,"Decent for the price, mine was slightly bent when it arrived"
3.0,Bottoms fit.. Top fit my chest but not under it.  I guess thats to be expected
3.0,Arrived with one pin broken off. Little bit of JB weld took care of that.I should not have to provide a repair to make something right. I am satisfied with the pin.
3.0,Por el precio no se puede pedir m√°s. Pero nescesita una targeta sim para funcionar.
3.0,The  material  is  different  then what I expected and also thin.
3.0,Very cute shoes but hard to get on my daughter's foot...  they gave her blisters on the tops of her feet.
3.0,This dress is cute but the empire waist is not as flattering as the appearance in the photo and description.
3.0,Color is not grey and it does not hang off the shoulder! The neck line is smaller than shown. I feel they sent me the wrong color
3.0,"I love the color its spot on as far as color and so is the height and width but, the zipper is lower then what I'd want or expected. The width is the ONLY reason I'm going to keep it. Would I buy it again? Nope üòï"
3.0,"Everything about this shirt was smaller than I expected. I'm 5'9"" and it was a LOT shorter on me than the model. I wanted a mena style sleep shirt not a midriff, lol!"
3.0,"If you‚Äôre bigger up top, size up."
3.0,"These are meant to go with a costume, so will only be worn once or twice. However, if you're looking for something to wear more than that, these aren't for you. They are very thin and will probably 'run' with more use."
3.0,"I was disappointed in the thickness of the silver.  I love the Celtic design, but it feels so thin that it may break."
3.0,The fit was good can tell it‚Äôs cheap. The zipper broke after one use. Going to see how much it will be to get that replaced.
3.0,The finishing was not good
3.0,"Very slim fitting, my fault for not investigating the sizing better, the drop down said boys extra large, and then when it arrived I noticed it said 11/12 on the tag. Most places a boys xl is a 14/16 so I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. They fit my daughter a little better because she has a longer torso than my son, he is broad shouldered, and huskier, and when he raises his arms it is too short. My son tried them on before washing, so forget it after it‚Äôs been washed, it will likely be smaller. It is a nice quality shirt, and it feels nice. I really wish they fit my son because he loved them. The company should consider making larger sizes."
3.0,"True to size, bought for work but cant wear it unless l have a tank underneath or clip it together. Pretty dress but it isnt black its more of a blue black.."
3.0,for grandson
3.0,It did keep my head warm.  only unexpected problem was wearing the face mask piece caused my breath to fog up my glasses while walking.  Had to undo it in order to see.
3.0,"The slits make it very interesting,  not true to size or height, though,  I need it 2 or 3 sizes up."
3.0,They‚Äôre nice sturdy shoes but most definitely NOT waterproof.
3.0,"I would probably give them 5, but sent me the wrong sizes labeled as correct<br /> Till I looked at the sewn in tag... already too late. Had washed gave them away couldn't return"
3.0,The scrunch in the back made these fit well.  Didn't look good on me but good quality
3.0,Last minute costume for Halloween. Arrived on time. Only issue with costume is the belt they move a lot maybe adding some loopse to hold in place. Other that that it did the job
3.0,The first day I wore this it broke with in the hour! Its cute but idk if I would buy again. I have to figure out a way to attach it back together.
3.0,Great fabric but rather short for opera length. I am 5'5&#34; and have average length and size toned arms with good muscle definition that are not flabby.
3.0,Not in love with this dress...WAY too much fabric and heavy.
3.0,"Nice soft fabric especially for the hot summer, BUT the waist size is 1-2sizes smaller. Had to return for the next larger size. Could have went 2 sizes bigger. Legs fit the same. Very comfortable."
3.0,It fits really weird and is dress length mostly. It's also tight up top in the chest and too big everywhere else. Not buying this again
3.0,I did not know they are so small.
3.0,"I like the material and the cut of this product.  The bust area has a lining so it is not see-though, however the rest of the blouse is a bit see through.  My only issue with the blouse is that the cut does not fit my body just right.  All parts of the blouse fit snuggly, but the drop V-neck collar seems to be a bit large and it looks loose and flops open.  I think that if I had a bigger bust size then I would have an issue with being to exposed.  I feel that I need to add a few more stitches to the bottom of the neck-line where it meets the waist band to secure the loose fabric in place.  I hate to have to purchase something and need to alter it right away.  I have worn this blouse with a sheer undershirt and a scarf to make sure I am not exposing myself and I have received multiple complements on it.  If this blouse fits your body it is a great buy.  I will disclose that I received a coupon voucher to purchase this product at a discount in order for my honest review."
3.0,"Everything is perfect... except the highest part of the elastic waist..it's way too tight.  So if I bought a bigger size, they'd be too baggy everywhere else.  Not for me."
3.0,"Clamp isn't tight. Stones fall off. But, I love the red."
3.0,Last time I'm sure they were made in Canada when I bought my son first pair! This time they came right from China to my door step! Hope they last like last pair
3.0,I want to like this so much. It covers the girls nicely. I had to tighten the straps all the way just to get to a normal supportive spot which is fine except the front bulged. And it bulged even more when you cross cross the straps. I normally wear Victoria‚Äôs Secret 34DD but after reviews and measurements I went with the 36DD. I was on the tightest clip in the bag when worn over the shoulder.
3.0,Totally to small i usually wear an xl go up the next size
3.0,"I like the material and the fact that the sleeves are actually long enough for my arms.  Except the arms are extremely big, as is the bodice part.  I ordered an XL based on my last bra sizing (put me at a 36B) but other than that, I generally wear a medium or large in junior sizes.  I like it, I'm just considering exchanging for the next size down."
3.0,Feels smaller than expected.  Fabric is thinner than expected.  More like chambrey instead of denim.  Hems have to be trimmed each time it is worn because of threads coming out of the seam.
3.0,"Meh?  Kind of cheap looking, husband not a fan..."
3.0,Very small. Broke the first time in less than 2 days. The seller however sent me another right away after I returned the original.
3.0,Not what I was expecting.  Should order your size it runs alittle big.
3.0,"Bought this when my band broke on my Garmin Vivofit 2.  It works, but it is nearly impossible to twist the clasp to lock the band (so difficult it isn't functional and I don't lock my band anymore...which makes me nervous).  I wouldn't buy this again knowing that....but I'm still using it as I have no other band yet...<br /><br />I do like the shape of the band...makes it MUCH easier to press the button on the device...A+ for that part."
3.0,Product broke within two months. The lens broke out of the glasses and cannot be put back in place.
3.0,Snagged bery easily. The tops  were not to tight so that was nice.  Got a hole where the garter suspender was attached.  They will work for a sexy look at home but if wearing out they will snag easily.  Felt nice and silky too.
3.0,"I bought these to wear during the holidays and got several complements on them. They are fun and fit my 5.5 foot just fine. They are not of a very high quality, which I expected and didn't mind since I wear them seasonally and only paid the sale price for them. They are more of a Payless shoe quality and there is no support or padding. I would never pay full price ($90) for them. I'd give them 3 stars for quality and 5 for &#34;what I was looking for&#34; in a fun shoe. They shipped directly from China and arrived earlier than suggested. Yeah, just in time for the holidays. üòä"
3.0,"Definitely not made for comfort, but they look nice.  Not super cheap looking at all.  These are true lace up, so if you need a bit of extra room, you can actually get it from these.  I do wish the heel was a bit chunkier."
3.0,This bag is tiny....it really can only fit your phone...and without the phone case on it.
3.0,"This sweater is so cute! However, the second time I wore it the seam in the arm tore."
3.0,not as long as expect
3.0,I bought  a large it was Very cute buttttttttttt... I'm 5'5 220 it wasn't  a good  look
3.0,"The bag is very small & not wide enough to fit a wallet & keys inside the main compartment.  It's fine if all you carry is a chapstick & credit cards, it's far to small even for the most compact daily items."
3.0,I wear these socks with slip-on Nikes (no laces) so it is essential that the socks be very thick. My old pairs of very thick socks have worn out and I cannot find others thick enough.<br /><br />I like the fact that these socks are cotton. Most socks are wool to which I am alergic.
3.0,Shoe runs small.  Need to buy at least a half size bigger.
3.0,I have the same dress in other colors.  This one was approximately 2 sizes smaller in width and alot shorter although it was ordered in the same size as the previous dress I own.
3.0,Fabric was cheaper than expected and not very soft.
3.0,Comfortable but the script is WAY TOO faint- you can't see it. Bummer.
3.0,For the price this bracelet set is nice. The finish started to turn right away.
3.0,I was very excited when I received my order but was disappointed because the sides where the stitches at the fabric was reaping apart from the stitches. I had to return them back though. Customer service was not bad they let me return it without any problems and that‚Äôs a good thing.
3.0,Hard to see with these. But they are cute. Just not practical.
3.0,"It fit a little too loosely at the waist for my liking. It was a fit and flare dress without the fit. It was also rather long!<br />Otherwise, the material is thick and good. It doesn't sit tightly off-shoulder as in the picture, but more settles comfortably off-shoulder.<br />The bright red is VERY bright!"
3.0,"Bigger than I expected, but very nice"
3.0,"Beautiful color and material. Unfortunately the Small is too big and it fits like a large almost. Very baggy in the waist/ hip area, both front and back. It is long, but that's expected. I tried to belt it, but it just looks hideous. I'll try to get it altered and hopefully it works out... I am 5'1;  115lb; 36 C."
3.0,I couldn't get links out.  My husband had too. It took him way longer than his.  It hangs very loose because of how it snaps on.  It is pretty though.
3.0,"The mask is well made which is why it‚Äôs disappointing that the eyes are so dark and there are no air holes. Also, the bands to secure the mask around your head are very tight on my 13 year old son and can‚Äôt be adjusted. Saw another review about the lenses being loose. This was the same with ours but easily glued back in."
3.0,"Love the purse its structured so nicely,but the chain strap broke the first time I used it."
3.0,The keychain is small.
3.0,"Looks nice. Quality appears good. Size is not as specified. I measured my bag and it's 15"" x 11"". Definitely not as large as the pictures of the models holding it. Somewhat of a disappointment as I was expecting a bigger bag."
3.0,"These glasses are WAY to big for babies. They are cute but it will be next year before he fits in them. And the have sharp edges on them around the eye part so I am going to see if I can fit them, which I hope I can so he can wear them."
3.0,It is okay..but the leather straps are all over the place...ok
3.0,Is not like I thought.
3.0,"The neckline is very strange. The back of the dress pulls on the neckline which is a little tight anyway so I spent all day pulling the front of my dress back down. Very thin fabric also. I'm 5'8&#34; and i ordered a 3x, fit was good."
3.0,"The top fits a little weird, but the bottoms are perfect."
3.0,When I say it's the wish version of the picture it's the wish version of the picture. I should have gone to Walmart to buy the costume instead. I bought a size 6 kids for my six year old and it swallowed her whole. I am having to alter it myself which is a pain in the butt. But I refuse to spend any more money on this product.
3.0,"Not a fan of the fabric, can be very uncomfortable, but it does the job"
3.0,This dress is beautiful. I got the medium (fits like a small) I'm 5'4 and I weigh 115lb. I have a really slender small frame and it fit just right my only complaint is the chest area fits weird it's too big the cups are huge. The cut is a little weird too it's not even
3.0,Thin material. Requires ironing
3.0,"Legs fit great, waist is too tight to be comfortable. I am not able to wear these for more than a couple of hours."
3.0,Very pretty ring but was about 1/2-1 size off from what was ordered. 4-6 of the shiny bits fell out very easily by the end of the first day or normal wear at a desk job which was a little disappointing.
3.0,"Earrings are small, and delivery of the product took some time. However, the wife was happy to get them."
3.0,It was good for the price. But definitely need to go up a size.
3.0,I had a previous pair that snapped in the suitcase.  I thought this was the same product.  What I wanted was the same style with darker glass.  It was my mistake to order StimuLight.  I had to return them.
3.0,Arrived on time. Does run small. And the material is very cheaply made. I‚Äôm surprised my<br />Daughter didn‚Äôt rip it putting it on.<br />Probably won‚Äôt purchase again.<br />Didn‚Äôt give 2 stars because it came on time.
3.0,Wouldn't fit even as a choker. Maybe for younger or thin women it would work.
3.0,I ordered this as a swimsuit cover and it works great for that.
3.0,The fabric was nice but did not fit me. It was to small and I ordered my normal size
3.0,These glasses are very big. I was not expecting that... I should have looked at the specs more closely.
3.0,"For something a toddler will most likely only wear once, it's exactly three stars - ok.  It came with a small tear in the side, but my wife was able to patch that up without issue.  You get what you pay for.<br />The dress itself is pretty lightweight.  It's a cute costume, and my daughter loved it.  Again - not high quality, but a decent product for the price and expected life."
3.0,Super cute if it fit right. Im petite and ordered a small and the sleeves we're too long.
3.0,I really like this ring but it is much bigger than I expected
3.0,I love the bracelet but it broke and I was very disappointed.  Would like to have it replaced. I will send it back for exchange.  Please tell me how to return.
3.0,Cheap fabric. The waist cinches in all the wrong places. I returned.
3.0,"I returned these becasue they lack  the compression that other Nike tights have. I found other tights that are way cheaper with better compression than these. I love Nike tights, but not these."
3.0,"Sadly my dress arrived later than expected, so I was unable to wear it for the occasion I hoped. I would have kept it, however it was too big and the top looked dirty. Not sure if it just got dirty in the packaging or what. Still good quality and customer service was great. I would buy again, but a different color and smaller size."
3.0,"Ordered for my daughter who is 5' tall and about 100 pounds. Based on the previous reviews I went with a medium and it fit great! The packing was really weird, it was essentially vacuumed into a plastic sack which made it feel odd But once we opened it the onesie puffed up. The fabric is super soft and cozy and my daughter was in love. However, with 1 day the extremely cheap zipper across the backside came apart with her just wearing it around the house. I was able to get it back on the track but it is seriously the tiniest, cheapest plastic zipper ever. It came apart again the next day when she attempted to wear this to her school's costume parade. I had to staple it shut in order for her be able to wear this trick-or-treating. Grandma (who sews) will have to completely replace the zipper to make this really usable. It's so cute and soft that she doesn't want to give it up. 5 stars for the cozy factor, 0 stars for the terrible zipper placement and quality."
3.0,"It's a nice sweater, just not true to size at all.  I normally wear 1X and I brought a 2X  and I am still just making it...I won't buy another one and I was planning too."
3.0,"Too large for front pocket carry, otherwise a good wallet"
3.0,I wish I got in a big size
3.0,"The top of the dress does not fit well for someone  with larger breasts, I‚Äôm 38DD and I ordered XL‚Ä¶"
3.0,No bra came with it
3.0,"Buena calidad, pero me aprieta bastante la cabeza y me hace doler, y no se puede regular por tiene goma."
3.0,"Nice soft leather, good zipper and well thought out design. The quality for the money seems pretty good. It fits everything you could ever want to carry in your wallet, however its more the size of a medium sized woman's wallet meant for a purse instead of ones pocket. It does indeed fit in a pocket so it can be carried that way if you wish but does fill up the entire pocket and is very noticeable. If you like a wallet of this size you won't be disappointed."
3.0,It runs a little small in my opinion but It‚Äôs nice and lightweight!!! I love the mesh on the upper back of the jacket!
3.0,"The earrings are very small and its hard to take them off, because of the sharp edges."
3.0,Really cute but the front is way too short.
3.0,I used model number and ordered these accordingly.  Unfortunately they did not fit. Matched number on site with number on shades. But didn't fit. The do however co.e nicely packaged.  As well as they look to be made well.
3.0,"es bonito pero la tela es muy clara, se nota todo."
3.0,For a 3x I thought there would be more volume to the skirt.
3.0,Great gag gift. Mounting adhesive is of questionable toxicity.
3.0,I like the outfit but I have to lose weight.<br />Shows a lot of my backside
3.0,"This is a super cute dress, however, I do not wear it out as the fabric is very thin like a nightgown.  Maybe others would feel comfortable wearing something this thin out but for me it is great for at-home wear. Too bad because I would like wear it out."
3.0,"Beautiful.  Sits a little high.  Long, goes to 1st knuckle.  Sizing was off, a full size bigger than I ordered.  Had to return."
3.0,The slots for the credit cards are a bit small. But I didn't pay much for it and it arrived quickly.
3.0,"Such a pretty top that I‚Äôm thinking of ordering a size up in. I usually order a large in items, however the reviews recommended a medium. The medium was perfect at the chest/stomach/ front but the arms and back of this shirt are tight enough that I can pull an Incredible Hulk shirt ripping scene<br />without all the anger ;)<br />It‚Äôs a pretty top, worth the try on with the free returns. I‚Äôm hoping the large fits better!<br />By the way, the app is not letting me put in my weight/height<br />5‚Äô8<br />166 lbs"
3.0,"Quality of materials is there, the idea is good but, ultimately it's pretty useless.  Any type of pouch would be better than this."
3.0,So when I bought these they were super cute online I got them home didn‚Äôt try them on because they were for vacation I then when I‚Äôm vacation and more than one day realize that they were way too small when I put them on I was like okay maybe they need to be broken so I wore them for a couple hours and realized that they were just too small I ordered one size up now I‚Äôm going to order two sizes up I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know how the size 2 up goes
3.0,"After being worn just a couple of times, the sewing that held the velcro straps together started to unravel.  Quite disappointed."
3.0,"This dress is very thin, the cut of the dress is not the same style as the picture. The ruffled flounce on the picture is flat with no ruffles at all."
3.0,The neck line was huge on me and the dress was too long.  I am only 5 ft.<br />Otherwise may look nice on someone tall
3.0,"The earrings themselves are beautiful. I love the way they look, and have been looking for a pair of thread-throughs for a while. Unfortunately they constantly slip through and if I didn't wear a backing on the posts then I would have lost them 10 times over by now. The backing helps to not loose them, but not to keep them from slipping and I am constantly re-adjusting them. Because I have sensitive ears I usually wear the posts that my ears were pierced with - the gauge on these earrings is bigger so maybe that is why I'm having difficulty..."
3.0,According to the size chart this should have fit well and a little loose. It definitely was a little smaller than I was hoping but it looks just like the photo. It‚Äôs also cotton and not super thick but the Cotten has zero stretch to it. It‚Äôs not a stretchy material in any kind of way. So def order up if you like your hoodies baggy.
3.0,Love this purse for traveling but it looks a little cheap. It is appropriately priced.
3.0,Cute enough but looks cheap
3.0,Shoe is nice but I saw the same exact shoe at Walmart a few days after my purchase with Walmarts sole in it.
3.0,"Kinda itchy, and surely won‚Äôt last long, a few weeks in and this scarf has so many pulls, loos threads. The length is great. I was just hoping for better quality then the ‚Äúdollar stores‚Äù in my area. And this might be longer, but it‚Äôs not better."
3.0,Item ran alot smaller than expected could not use or wear
3.0,Very difficult to place tiny backings on earring posts.  Earrings on their own are lovely.  Uncomfortable to wear because of tightness of posts.
3.0,"I like it a lot, but it would.be better of the belt loop was higher."
3.0,The band is not flexible like the fitbit original. It has rubbed my skin raw on the wrist area.<br />We will see what happens with time.
3.0,"The quality is not what I expected, but I can‚Äôt complain because the price was reasonable"
3.0,I have been searching high and low for a cute pair of sweats that are NOT joggers. When I found these I was so excited. When they arrived they looked nothing like the picture. I‚Äôm disappointed.
3.0,"My wife has been using these earrings for the past two weeks in the limited occasions that we go out these days and said that while they are very stylish and look great with their large overhang design that mimics a delicate thread pattern .. they are very thin and flimsy. It was hard for her to put them on and secure them without bending<br /><br />LIKES<br />- The design mimics that of a a thread pattern earrings and looks very nice. But its actually a very thin sheet of metal<br />- They did not cause any sensitivity or redness when wearing them for extended periods<br />- The good part about its lightweight construction is that you hardly feel that they're there, despite a large design<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />- The post is very thin and its difficult to put the fastener on without bending due to a high amount of resistance in the fastener<br />- The black bead like part which covers the ear lobe is also very thin and can be bent easily<br /><br />Overall these are good looking earrings that have a nice design , however at $12.99 we feel that its a bit overpriced due to its thin materials making it less durable. 3 Stars"
3.0,"This dress was way too small in the bust area. I wear a 38D, and the zipper was about 3 inches from closing."
3.0,There beautiful.  Way to large so they're not for every day wear. More for date night
3.0,"I have to say that these are comfortable, but all the stitching around the legs has come apart, on every single pair."
3.0,"Cute pattern, but thin fabric (not thick like flannel) and the elbow patches look pretty cheap. It's okay."
3.0,Doesn't wick away the sweat but l looks good on.
3.0,We use these as patient safety glasses but they do not hold up well to the disinfectant wipes. The coating on top becomes flaky and scratched looking very quickly which makes them look dirty.
3.0,I bought this because I wear my earrings around the clock so they have to be small. It came off while I was sleeping so I am wishing the clasp was tighter.
3.0,They are really cute. 2 of them I couldn't open they just would not pull apart. But besides that they fit perfect and I loved that so many came with it so I had different options
3.0,Average quality.  Will keep....but not what I expected.  Long dress...but not very formal.  Looks like a standard bridesmaid dress.
3.0,"The bottoms are awesome but the top is worthless if you have boobs; any amount of boobs. There is so much padding that the top literally (and I know the difference between literally and figuratively) rests on top of your nipples. If you tie it tight enough you can smoosh it down to almost look like your boobs; except for that your own boobs will be oozing (not in a sexy way at all) out of the side. So then you will try to push your boobs back under the pillows of this top and actually have a moment of accomplishment before noticing your nipples are now upward facing and on full display. Like two pink eyes staring up at you asking you politely to put them back in their normal position.  Just give up and find a different top to go go with the awesome bottoms. But don't throw the top out! No, what you want to do is make your friends try it on after a few drinks, because NO ONE can make this top fit but it's hilarious to see the attempts!"
3.0,Pretty sure this be a piercing lol since u only get one
3.0,"Color and style are great.  Also, lightweight.  However, I am female, and this is definitely a man's shirt - buttons the wrong way and sleeves are WAY too long.  Keeping it anyway - for yard work."
3.0,I loved this blouse. I used it for the beach. I am giving it 3 stars because after 5-10 uses it starts falling apart. It was nice blouse while it lasted.
3.0,"The cups fit great, as does the band.... But the straps fit so wide, they slide off my shoulders! Wearable,but not quite what I had hoped."
3.0,"I like the fabric, it has a very good stretch and is soft which make it comfortable, but I feel that the support cups for my size are too small. I feel like it runs a little bit in the small side for me. I‚Äôm a L/XL 38D"
3.0,Good colors but kind of loose even with my head of hair.
3.0,"Pretty swimsuit,  but the strap eyelet at the cup tore out while trying it on.  Will have to resew the area to make it strong enough to hold while swimming."
3.0,"really cute! Not super comfortable the bottoms aren't as soft as they look in the picture and one of the pads is dying :( but overall i like them, and can probably fix it on my own."
3.0,I love the necklaces but it took a huge amount of time to get it shipped. I ordered it a week or two before valentines day and got it a few days later. It wasn't what I expected. But what I did like was that it came already gift wrapped.
3.0,"The gloves are warm and waterproof, but the enormous thumbs make them all but useless. I'm a male with big hands and I have an inch of empty, loose material beyond my actual thumb that gets in the way and makes menial tasks difficult or impossible rendering these gloves useless for doing anything but keeping your hands warm and dry, to that end they work great."
3.0,It is way tighter than I thought
3.0,Cool hat but not adult osfa as advertised
3.0,The shoe storage area is great for my needs! The duffle bag is great for the gym and as an overnight bag. It's holding up pretty well. I've had to for a couple of months now.<br /><br />Update: The shoe storage compartment started tearing and is completely torn from the duffle bag.
3.0,It's slick...I was hoping it would be softer. It's still cute though
3.0,"Usually I‚Äôm 38C size, but this bra run small. I recommend you ask for the next size, the material is of good quality, but it‚Äôs small. Probably I‚Äôll order in different size."
3.0,"Fits very small, but is a nice shirt"
3.0,"Not really enough of an arch..,"
3.0,The hat is adjustable but even at it‚Äôs largest part fit small and my head is not very big.
3.0,They broke fairly quickly.  They look really cute but I didn't get to use them like I would have liked.
3.0,colors are a bit off compared to the pictures but okay looking. cheap leather tho
3.0,"Looked like it did in the photo. Just did not fit well with my body type. I'm curvy and 5'4""."
3.0,"I was excited for this legging because I heard good things about them, BUT I had to return them and I'll tell you why.<br />PRO: The legging is compressive and snatches your waist and your booty looks very good. The contour is perfect and not over doing it. It's not brushed or soft legging so don't expect it to be. Its just seamless legging.<br /><br />CONS: The waist band is TIGHT. The tightest part of the legging. legging fits me perfectly everywhere, but the tightness of the waist band was a no for me. It was fine, but if you carry weight on your stomach you are just going to have big rolls from the waist band even if the legging fit. SIZE UP!! Not only that sheerness and squat proof on the leggings are different so read the info to see the percentage of sheerness. A darker color may be more sheer than a lighter color, which I don't understand why.<br /><br />COST: Is it worth the cost? $30+? I wouldn't buy it again, but I think it decent for others. I've bought other leggings that is $20+ and I truly think that they are better.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I think that if you are a girl who has a flat tummy/fit or don't carry most of your weight on your stomach, then this legging would be great for you. For my other girls like me who has some tummy you are just going to have roll or bulges from the waist band or you can try sizing up. Read through the reviews and look at the picture. There was only like one person who I saw that had picture and show how tight the band was. She show that most of her weight was on her stomach and what the legging look like on her.  Try it out if you are not sure, you can always return."
3.0,"Between the online description and measurements along with reading reviews I ordered the size 10. Big mistake! Top says XL on the inside tag and boy is it ever! Way too big! Like two sizes too big! I hope my mom can alter it for me. It has no support, but that may be because it's just too big. Inexpensive price, but when it doesn't fit it isn't worth it."
3.0,"Cute dress but the shoulders fit weird. Too big and puffy. The fabric was suffocating, not breathable at all. But still a very cute dress."
3.0,Beautiful dress and per reviews I ordered a size up. It was big and very long. I'm 5'2&#34; and even with 3&#34; heels it dragged on the floor.<br />Returned and may get a size down. It's a perfect summer floral dress. Wished it fit.
3.0,looks ok but matte finish is peeling off
3.0,It is thin material. I could see outline of my bra‚Ä¶good for around the house with tights.
3.0,"I liked the look and all, but the boots were too small and i'm returning them. My other ankle boots in size 8 fit well, with enough room for socks. For this boot, an 8-1/2 probably would have fit."
3.0,Nice hat. Fit was fine. Couldn‚Äôt tell from the pics that the black band wrapped all the way around the front of the hat. Not the look I thought it was. Otherwise a nice hat.
3.0,I want to use them for groceries but one ripped right away. I unfolded a few during a trip and they were not easy to fold. Cute though.
3.0,"They're cute and just the right size. However, one is broken. It slipped off as the wire didn't hold it in place tightly. But I have the other two sets to wear. Still, I'm happy with my purchase and they're easy to put on."
3.0,I love look of the necklace. But when got ready to wear it one of the gold clasp had come off. It is not something that I can repair myself.
3.0,"This is my review for Roludom Men's Woodland Wintet Fleece Lined Camouflage Cargo Pant, 40 Yellow Camo. I bought these pants for my husband, who likes to wear this kind of stuff working outside and tramping through the woods.¬† He has worn them a few times now, and tells me that they are holding up pretty well.¬† First the negative.¬† These pants are snug.¬† After reading other reviews, I decided to buy a size larger.¬† Good thing I did. At a full size larger than the rest of his pants, these pants are just barely wearable.¬† He would have preferred an additional size up.¬† Because they are so tight, he doesn't feel that he has the range of motion that he has in his other similar pants. To the positive, the lining is comfortable, the heavy cotton does a pretty good job at keeping dry, but it is cotton and will have its limits.¬† Heavy weight material has done a fair job of fending off the briars when walking off the blazed trail.¬† All in all, he says that they are pretty good, but won't be his first choice, partly because of the sizing and mostly because he prefers his other options, which offer greater range of motion. I was fortunate to receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I always pre-test every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether negative or positive."
3.0,Too tight didn't fit my head and I have a small head.
3.0,Cloth material is generic....
3.0,Beautiful but too big for my nose and my cartilage. It‚Äôs a thick ring and didn‚Äôt fit in my friends‚Äô piercings either.
3.0,Took awhile to arrive. Orange color is more prominent than in picture and color did not really cover edges which I did not care for. Nice feel to band.
3.0,Bigger than I wanted. Hang down lower than wanted. Still attractive and can be dressy or casual.
3.0,Great adhesive but does not lift my breast as expected... I do use this product only to hide my nipples!
3.0,"Nice top, but runs large.  The small was even too big.  Had to return. Wish they sold XS."
3.0,Love the color & stones but the clasp gets lose after couple wears & it starts falling off
3.0,Me quedo chico !!
3.0,"This dress only comes in Small, which is usually my size, but it was about a size too big. I am a 34 in bust, 29in waist, and 34 in hips. It ran like a Medium, so I had to return it."
3.0,"I usually love Panache bras, but the band on this one was super loose compared to any others I've owned. It still fits when I gluse the tightest hook, I just won't be able to wear it for as long once it stretches out."
3.0,"The fit wasn't terrible, but it was a bit odd. Based on the picture, I thought it was more of a cape where the arms peeked out if you stood a certain way. On me at least, your arms peek out no matter how you stand. Perhaps it's because I have somewhat wide shoulders for a girl."
3.0,"The Lucky's with the Shamrocks on them fit my husband better, he doesn't really like these that much."
3.0,"It doesn‚Äôt seem to glow for too long maybe a minute, but it‚Äôs asorable and doesn‚Äôt turn your finger green :)"
3.0,thought they were taller
3.0,"It‚Äôs beautiful. However, it doesn‚Äôt fit as it does the model. In 2 uses, the wiring came out of the top. I was wondering why I felt breast tissue pains, and it was that dreaded stabbing wire. There‚Äôs no stability for busty girls. I‚Äôm a G cup and bought a 3x for good measure. It‚Äôs not great, but I know that they tried"
3.0,MIne came in an okay condition. The piece was half way off and popped of after 3 hours. fixed it with hot glue (which is what was holding it) cute for what its worth and needs gently care. ships fast and im still somewhat happy with this product.
3.0,"I did not see a way to choose the color, and through my own error, got a black one. For hot days in the sun, that is not what is needed. I wish I had a white or beige one."
3.0,this was my third pick first two didn't have size or color ok for the price
3.0,Like a more substantial material. A little too long for my 5‚Äô4‚Äù height.  Just my oreference
3.0,"Love the cap, but the design seats a little awkwardly than other caps and tends to give me headaches. I'm a little disappointed with that."
3.0,I couldn't find these length shoe laces in round style in the store. I find shorter lengths or this length is the flat style but I like the round style fits in the shoes lace holes better I think. So I found these on line I got them they seem right length and good quality think they will last awhile. Just wish they were cheaper.
3.0,These don't last long.  Like one pair I wore through the toe in 1 day.  I wear a size 12-13.
3.0,"Comfy but very see through! I sized up because I expected them to be, but even with sizing up stl very see through"
3.0,...you are big busted with a small waist.  I liked the fit but just too big in the chest area.  Returning.
3.0,Trying to stretch it on a bowl...  Too small for my husbands big head
3.0,"The watch looks nice, just as advertised but WAY small for a man's wrist. I bought this for my husband for Valentine's day and it barely fit on him so he ended up giving it to me üòÅ wrist pictured is mine. This seems more like a woman's or child's size. My husband has several different colors of these Casio watches and they are all much larger than this one in both the band and the watch face."
3.0,"The quality is fine, but I didn't realize how big it would be. It's definitely for a larger wrist. If you have delicate wrists, get a different bracelet. This one falls right off my arm. :)"
3.0,It looks like the picture. I'm<br />Not crazy about the fabric. It's very fitted and feels like Lycra.
3.0,Fit well for a larger girl. Quite happy with it but the underwire came out on one of the cups after a week.
3.0,I bought this bag for my 4yr old daughter for ballet and tap.  She loves the bag but it small.  It does fit her shoes.
3.0,The gems fell out as soon as we opened the package. The glove itself is durable and made of latex or some other other plastic. My kids love to play  with this  which is the only reason it was not returned.
3.0,"It‚Äôs very cute and stretchy, but it‚Äôs too short. It has slits on the sides. The lavender color is great."
3.0,"The color is wrong and looks nothing like the picture. I ordered light pink and got silver with grey and an almost unnoticeable amount of pink. Like, I debate if the pink is really there, amount. That said, as a short woman with no waist but a fair amount of hip and thigh, this fits really well and I bought it to match a sweatshirt so it might work. Material is scratchy as is all material with silver flecks in it but not so bad that I would send it back or be unable to forget about it after wearing it for an hour.<br /><br />When I bought this, I was hoping for a pair of sweatpants to wear at home as the picture looks like a pair of comfy sweatpants and I chose the color without all the silver, but this is not a stay-in-comfy-wear type of pant, it‚Äôs a wear outside type. I don‚Äôt like wearing sweatpants outside the house so I am debating what to do with it but I will keep it because of the fit."
3.0,This top runs very large for a small.
3.0,It‚Äôs ok looking
3.0,Comfortable and easy to manage shirt:
3.0,"I loved the style and the color but for me the sizing ran too small  I ordered my normal size but when I tried it on, it was small"
3.0,The shirt is very nice. The shirt is too tight because I‚Äôm top heavy. It is a tailored shirt
3.0,Too small and didn't like the fabric.
3.0,For x large they're not. Color is nice and so is the material. Hard to get on and tight.
3.0,"Band fit fine and looks good, but the clasp is extremely tight. Wife was unable to open it while it was on her wrist. We decided to order a magnet-clasp style band which she is much happier with. Fits the Samsung Gear S2 (42mm version, not 3G)."
3.0,"I want to adore this corset. I really do the quality is incredible. Ive corsetted for years and i know how to properly corset, got the right size but for some reason this just wont suck my lower abdominal area in. Thats what you want for waist training. All corsets should be able to do this even based on if you have a larger rib cage but this one just has strange design because of how low the pannels are. I cant wear in public because they get in the way of wearing anything else other then a big skirt. I wish the pannels wherent rhere because this wouldve been great but i feel like it affects functionality of the corset and its a shame because the quality ia unlike any other for the price"
3.0,Nice colors & fabric but runs 1 or 2 sizes small. Hubby usually wears a XXL but this was skin tight. Think ‚Äúfat guy in a little coat‚Äù from Tommy Boy. Yah. That small.
3.0,This skirt says flared but it is not. It is tight all the way down and not flowy at all.
3.0,Good mask but the eye cut outs are too close so you can only see from one eye
3.0,cute dress! it‚Äôs kinda long but it‚Äôs good for when you‚Äôre working with kids! I love the dress
3.0,Turned my finger green. Really pretty though.
3.0,"Really good for collection, but will break very quickly if used in a duel or dropped"
3.0,The necklace is quite heavy and much bulkier than i expected so i will gift it for Christmas
3.0,Beware!  The vents that fasten to the mask don't stay on very well.
3.0,not the wallet I need should not have ordered it will pass on  to someone else
3.0,while i was sleeping they would come off and my piercing would begin closing over night
3.0,Super cute but the sleeves are a little puffy (if that‚Äôs even the right word) they have two layers of material.
3.0,Nice product could be a little bigger..very hard to read
3.0,A little difficult to put on
3.0,Keeps opening on my wrist.
3.0,I usually wear a medium so I bought my size based on the reviews...it's a little big. I probably should have gotten a small. The sweater itself is nicely made and comfy.
3.0,"It's ok. It doesn't look like real turquoise, it looks more like a homemade bracelet."
3.0,"I am busty and curvy. I always wear A-line to cover my thighs and hide my tummy. Really wanted to love this dress, but it was just slightly off everywhere. I am 5""1 and this came about 1.5"" above my feet. Even higher when I adjusted the waist and to move the pockets. Might be better for someone with smaller thighs/hips/tummy."
3.0,"I love the colors! The stitching it was makes me iffy about the rating. This does fit will, but the stitching was already coming apart when it was sent to me."
3.0,I ordered an extra large thinking that it would fit but they ran small!!!
3.0,Just the right size and I love the colors for summer. Only disappointmentioned is I thought it was leather. My bad!
3.0,Too small and when tried to return got no response
3.0,These are a good bargain. Make sure you measure your finger so that you get the correct size. Fit well and look ok. Very good bargain.
3.0,The material not quite what I expected. Ok for workout
3.0,"I expected there to be more of the designed SS than there was. This was only a small piece and the rest was just the thin chain.  I wanted to like this watch band and I think that if there was ore of the ""bracelet"" it would have been better.  I found that if I had it tight enough so that my watch did not slip around my wrist then the edges would dig into my skin.  Any looser and my watch would just swivel around my wrist.  Maybe this is just designed for people with tiny wrists!"
3.0,Very flimsy and the backs will not stay on. They slide on then pop right back off.
3.0,"The diamonds could be sparklier, or clearer looking for the $300 price point. Also, make sure you understand the sizing next to the ruler, it is a tiny piece."
3.0,"Overall these were great quality. Thick, rubber wasn't thin or falling off. Only thing is I'd say they run a little small. My son wears a 10.5, but his feet are wide & while they fit, it's just barely. Other than that, great quality, great socks!"
3.0,"This jacket is very light, if that is what you are looking for. I would use it as a wind breaker only. Ordered the medium and would need a large especially if dressed in layers."
3.0,Still evaluating
3.0,It's a little odd that the sizes for the son are reliant on the sizes for the father. So only someone small can have a toddler? I think that you should be able to choose each size separately.
3.0,Thin material that doesn't smooth well at all. Way too big and stretchy.
3.0,I found the Wayfarer Sunglasses very good.  The color is closer to lavender and less like deep purple. They fit pretty good.
3.0,"It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ large. And a bit boxy. I think the fiber content is 20/80 cotton/poly so it didn‚Äôt really shrink much in the wash (but it let loose a torrent of dye, so be forewarned‚Ä¶ wash with like colors only!) The craftsmanship is decent enough, ergo my not taking off more stars. But yeah‚Ä¶ a medium fits more like a large, at least in my case. The instructions say to dry flat, but it held up decently enough in the dryer (I was trying to shrink it). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù 165lbs, slimish build and a solid medium most of my life and this is just too big. If you‚Äôre a bit stocky or have more defined muscles then this may be more true to size."
3.0,Works well with a tankini top  Good tropical color
3.0,"I love the design.  The only issue I have is that it got caught in my glove, came off and I lost it."
3.0,"Cute style but super thin material that shows ever single fat roll. I'm  5'3,A cup, 130lbs and ordered a small. Above the buttons looked great, waist down... just not comfortable with.  If you don't have that problem... this would be great."
3.0,"So I got these sunglasses pretty quick, however the quality isn't the greatest. I know spending 15bucks on a couple of sunglasses isn't much, I'm not looking for oakly quality but still. The one I had to get the lens fixed becuase it popped out of place. Conclusion 1 star for price 1 star for how quick I got them. 1 star for getting 4 for the price in a store for . total 3 stars!!!"
3.0,"The size is a little larger than preferred, but is still workable... my 10 yr old daughter wears it very loosely, and my grown up brother can wear it without slipping off. But it's generally looser than preferred The design, is nice, and clear. Stitching is decent. Biggest problem is that it is THIN... Not meant for winter warmth."
3.0,"Looks very Nice but of poor quality, can‚Äôt complain for the price."
3.0,the waist part folds down so it it a lot of top fabric. they were very tight in the hip area & waaaayyyyy too short. i expected what the picture looked like full on pants but they go to the knee at best & i‚Äôm 5ft5. if your curvy these may be way too tight but on the slimmer side you‚Äôll be ok. they just have no stretch to them.
3.0,At first I really liked these but the longer I wore them the bigger they got.
3.0,"I am happy so and so. The surgical steel is excellent quality, durable, nice color, but the stone...is uglier than a sintetic stone. It's like glitter with glue on it in oval shape. On the white stone is not so visible, but on the green one is obvious. I think it matters about how much you care about details, because looking from far it looks awsome. The size is a little bigger than the standard one, for me doesn't fit so well. I think the price is fair. It came both items, but i posted pictures only with the green one. The shipping arrived exactly in the day they said."
3.0,I'm not sure how they do their measurement but it's too small
3.0,These socks are just ‚Äòok‚Äô. They are thin and snag easily. Cute designs though
3.0,Thicker fabric than expected
3.0,"its a nice ring,  just to thick looking for my fingers"
3.0,"Love the style of the  dress. Truly a beautiful dress and I've received many compliments on it This is my second purchased dress from this company.  Again I do love the style of the dress, however, the same problem as with the first dress discoloration on the dress."
3.0,Bottoms fit to size but top is bigger (and I am 42G) I ordered a 3X. Bottoms are great but top has no support.
3.0,Its OK and the color and shape are nice
3.0,"Super cute but really wide and shorter than it looks in the picture, Also it's Taupe not grey, which is what I wanted but everyone else might not feel the same."
3.0,We had to return these since they didn't fit my daughters ears. They might be good for a baby but they were way too small to go through the earlobe of my 5 year old. She loved the look of them but after trying twice to get them in she agreed they had to go.
3.0,This shirt is thin and very fitted. I thought it would be looser like the picture.
3.0,"These are super small, even for kids."
3.0,"I am a 36C and an XL is way too small, an XL is possibly a S/M in the U.S.. The design and material is perfect, however. I wish it was my sizee :/"
3.0,"These arrived squished! The foam these are made out of are not as substantial as name brand competitors like Crocs. The pattern also transferred onto the straps. I had to stuff these full of paper towels to reshape the shoes prior to putting them on my daughter's feet. It worked a little bit, but permanent creases in the shoes are visible. Otherwise, the color and pattern was very cute. Works well during wet play and regular every day wear."
3.0,"This runs small and is tight at the waist (I usually wear S/M and I ordered M). The color is a tad dull than it appears in the picture. The material is soft but quite thin. The underside of the crotch is black - looks weirdly conspicuous during workouts. I do not recommend.<br /><br />Edit: Upon a few uses and washes, it fits well."
3.0,This is a great tee however the only information that the description is missing is that the fabric has a ‚Äúgoldish‚Äù sparkle. It‚Äôs says men‚Äôs tee but I purchased this to match my tie dye tee and u fortunately once you see the fabric in real life you can‚Äôt NOT see the sparkle.
3.0,Very pretty but too tiny
3.0,But I would recommend ordering 1/2 to one full size larger than you typical wear. But great for the price.
3.0,I gave it to my daughter who is is a size Small and I am XL
3.0,"face looks good, but needs a wig too."
3.0,"Not at alllllll like the picture. Very boxy fit & too short for my torso & arms. Luckily I bought it for some silly around-the-house lounge wear. The outside is soft and cozy, it is a completely different cheap feeling fabric on the inside. Not recommended for fashion, but it‚Äôs fine for snuggling on the couch with no plans of seeing anyone in the general public. Hah!"
3.0,Grandkids love in the colder weather.
3.0,"The socks are very thin. Feels more like nylon, not cotton. I put a hole in them in a week."
3.0,Hard to keep clean they should send instructions with product
3.0,The dress is very cute but larger than expected. I got a small but wish it was smaller (I am a size 4-6). It fits very loose.
3.0,"Really had a difficult time adjusting the band, I ended up ordering a new band."
3.0,"This was too large for my arm.  When I pull the strap tight enough to fit snug, the velcro reaches past the point of sticking.  I'm sorry to have to return it.  Also, I don't know if I want to bother with taking off my phone cover each time I want to use this to put on the black cover.  I don't want to always have the black cover on my phone."
3.0,The stitching has flaws. One of the pockets has a hole because it was not sewn properly. Not enough cleavage coverage. I wear this around the house or to the pool but wouldn‚Äôt wear it out of the house otherwise.
3.0,The material is soft but the pouch is tight. I have a thick penis so I found it to be constricting .
3.0,You cannot wash this coat or dry clean it or put it in the dryer.  It runs small.
3.0,This is well made with quality fabric and absolutely darling looking but not super functional. I will probably only use it for a special occasion like maybe Christmas day or family photos but then I wont be putting it on my baby again. The buttons are loop hole buttons and super annoying on clothing for a wriggling baby. If the cost is worth a short wear for some cute pictures then it's a good buy. It could make a good gift so the parents can get the cute pictures without the guilt of spending money on an item their baby will only wear for a short time. Or I guess if you're super patient then these buttons wont be a problem for you.
3.0,The bracelet is a little clunky and heavy. I find I don't wear it often.
3.0,Very short for a xxl
3.0,These shorts didn‚Äôt fit like a 38‚Äù . I would size up one or two sizes especially if you want a roomy fit. My son found these to be a bit snug and he normally wears 36‚Äù shorts. They are decent quality just not big enough
3.0,"This beanie runs small, so I wasn't too happy with the fit and comfort."
3.0,in like it :*
3.0,"It is not the right material on the top surface.<br />If I buy 5.5 will be too tight and short, however, 6.5 is a little bit long"
3.0,"I love the material as always. The length though is a bit too long, im 5&#34;2 so if you get this dress you might want to get a size S. The Medium is a bit too long"
3.0,"So these gloves are cheap and Chinese. Not a great combination. They look beautiful I will give them that. But they are thin. There is hardly any insulation on the inside. The leather is very cheap and very thin. The stitching at the end of each finger is not smooth and it does not create a good curvature and texting with these gloves is impossible. Don't even try. There are two good things. One, they look good. Two, they are actually very grippy driving gloves. I have a smooth leather steering wheel these gloves grip it very wheel even when I'm palming. It still doesn't justify everything else I said before. And the price?? Get outta here. Had I known, I would pay maybe $10 for these."
3.0,"Is a slightly lesser quality than a similar band ordered from a different brand. Hangs on clothes a little bit and the magnet is not as strong, both in comparison to the comparable item."
3.0,"not impressive, returned, fast no hassle return , thank you"
3.0,"Nice quality and color, just too tight."
3.0,se rompe facilmente en un mes ya se partio la correo.no es tan recomendable
3.0,"Initially purchased the gold frame and received the silver :(, although I‚Äôm not as satisfied as I typically am with Sojos, they are pretty great shades. Just really wished they came in gold ‚Äî more upset about how I can‚Äôt return it!"
3.0,"I ordered a 36 and received an XXL ... so fit was not great.  I would estimate this is a 38-40"" waist.  I can't really comment on fit obviously but the quality is pretty decent.  The fabric is stretch but not overly so and heavy enough that I'm not afraid my keys are going to rip a hole through the fabric.  These would make pretty decent mountain biking shorts if you got them in the right size.  I will try them out with a belt and see if I can turn them into a pair of riding shorts.  I wish I had received the right size, I would have given 4-5 stars."
3.0,"Look good, but it is &#34;lighter&#34; in terms of quality. Ear pieces are plastic not metal. Simple, would I purchase again, yes."
3.0,I felt like the bikini seemed a little cheap. I didn't like the fit but that's just my body type .I returned it.
3.0,Tiny earrings more for a baby or toddler
3.0,"It is ok , but it is to big for the size I order like one size bigger"
3.0,Love the size of the umbrella and the crank option... however thought the base would have been steadier could not use without sand bags to keep it from tipping over other than than great product
3.0,Very pretty heart but small.  It comes separately from the small necklace so it needs to be attached or threaded to the little silver chain.<br /><br />The earrings are probably a Barbie Doll size or possibly a little larger. Don‚Äôt think they will work at all on a woman‚Äôs ears.
3.0,"Too big. I bought this dress in small. I always wear a small. I'm 5'2&#34;, 105 lbs and this was huge on me. Will return."
3.0,Run small. Tight across my little feet. Won't buy anything else.  Cute.
3.0,"This is just okay‚Äî offers tummy control but no shaping. The shorts don‚Äôt roll up but the top rolls down, which would be very noticeable when paired with tight clothes."
3.0,Was trying to avoid a crop top but that's exactly what I got. The arms fit a little tight too
3.0,some straps broke after the first wash.  Stretches quickly.  wont buy again
3.0,Pretty but very hard to open
3.0,"I like the make of the jacket, but the color is more of a dark mustard yellowish gold. I decided to dye it black. It runs small but follow the American sizing and you'll be fine. I ordered two sizes up and it fit."
3.0,"They're so light, one fell out. I will put backings on theM the next time I wear them."
3.0,It's big & so far keeps good time. A cheap watch for the working man. It's so big it kept rubbing the bone in my wrist & made it sore. They don't make them mush larger than 55mm!!!!!
3.0,"Well, for the price I shouldn't complaint but the black and white, when it stretches it fades. I don't like that."
3.0,its nice but grabs every hair and fuzz around
3.0,Decent quality however I am almost always a small and this small was way too big in the band.
3.0,Broke in a week :((((((((((( Very very very very sad.
3.0,I love the sunglasses but they don‚Äôt really protect my eyes from the sun. The lens is very transparent.
3.0,"Good for an interview, did it‚Äôs job"
3.0,These came out what I thought they would be like for the price. These arnt perfect but they good because one of the diamonds isn't secured all the way so it rattles sometimes.
3.0,Love the style and material but don't like that its see through - I have to wear a cami with it and nothing lacy as it shows right through and isn't attractive.
3.0,Crotch is a little too low<br />Draw strings too long
3.0,"I bought this because I needed something with a countdown timer to referee soccer games. It does the job. However, the buttons are arranged idiosyncratically, which means I can never remember which ones to press, and have to click around incessantly every time I use it (once a week).<br /><br />I do get compliments on it, however, which is funny, since that was not my goal; and I have a feeling that having all the buttons on one side contributes to its good looks."
3.0,It's a good product but the color is going in 2 months
3.0,for some reason this shoe was snug but the others fit great same size!
3.0,"They look fine for the most part , but the clamp mechanism makes them pop up a bit more and to the side, a sliding clip might be better"
3.0,"Would perhaps need a slip if cooler weather or in air conditioning, very thin material"
3.0,Seems to be very light plastic but should last a while.
3.0,Love the shoes and myself and my daughter were excited about the charms it came with‚Ä¶. They were too small for the holes‚Ä¶.. they don‚Äôt stay in.  I added glue to the back‚Ä¶. Helped a little but she already lost one in one day
3.0,Belt barely makes it around my waist line and my waist is 32&#34;
3.0,"These are thin like the dress socks you‚Äôd wear when grandma‚Äôd pick out your clothes for you before Sunday service. They fit fine, but prepare to lace up your shoes again before heading out with these socks under them."
3.0,"I bought a few of these in different colors and prints while on sale last season and noticed the print ones were made out of a different, thicker, less soft material. The ones I have like that are holding up, but the soft grey one (which honestly fit better) tore along the sleeve strap. I didn‚Äôt even start wearing this one til the start of spring/summer and it‚Äôs fallen apart. Knocking stars off for durability, leaving stars because of the nice fit"
3.0,"Eh. It's ok. A little short and frankly the front 'frills' look unfinished. Wouldn't order again, but too lazy to return lol."
3.0,I'm 5'5&#34; 125lbs 34A. I ordered a medium. It was a bit longer than I care for.
3.0,"I got these to give out as wedding gifts for my family and wedding party.  They worked great for the one day that most would wear them, but would not hold up well for everyday wear.  Overall very good value"
3.0,"These pants fit nicely, but I find it extremely difficult to find the material I want when I order online."
3.0,"I like it.  It's cute and comfy. A little wide on the shoulders and stitching on zipper makes the dress poke out on one side at my hips, I suppose it's not too noticeable but it fits pretty good. It is see through even with the under dress. I could see my nude underwear through the dress.  I may alter after the wedding to have it be just the blue part and wear over my bikini's."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:43d696947d7d9c72d3fd359b20498df4]] It doesn't glow in the dark but it still looks pretty good. And it came with an extra gem so I'll keep it.
3.0,"I love the bag, but I think it might be a knock-off. It had several very short but thick black threads sticking out right in the front, very obvious on the light colored material. They're so short that I can't cut them. I can't imagine Betsey allowing such poor quality control. I'm going to keep the bag, because it's cute. But I won't order from this seller again."
3.0,These were way too small on my 6 year old - hurt to even put on.  May be good for younger ages.
3.0,a little big for my granddaughter .
3.0,Pens√© que era de mejor calidad en la tela y color
3.0,"These pants are very comfortable and soft, but I am hesitant to wear them outside of the house as they are quite thin. They were very reasonable though, so I will be keeping them to wear around the house, or perhaps with a long shirt."
3.0,"THE PURSE WAS TOO BIG FOR ME. THE DIMENSIONS WERE STATED IN THE PRODUCT INFO, BUT THEY DIDN'T MAKE A DEFINITE REFERENCE AS TO EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO, IE SUCH AS LENGTH, DEPTH, OR WIDTH.  OTHERWISE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY."
3.0,Ok I bought one somewhere else cheaper
3.0,"Pretty good quality, but runs small."
3.0,My daughter bought this for her and her friend but the charms keep falling off. The charms are the main reason she got this. She almost lost one of them and says they are a bit hard to get back on.
3.0,Fit great but J the neck is really wide on the shirt. Product should of mention wide neck.
3.0,couldn't get the 3 smallest sizes on just because I have some thick ear lobes that wouldn't fit through the spiral. but very pretty
3.0,Well made runs small. I based size on a Fila soccer shirt but compression is very tight around shoulders and arms
3.0,"I love these, however you'll need to take the backs off another pair, as the backs that came with them doesn't fit on the post......."
3.0,didn't fit as expected.
3.0,Not as slouchy as the picture but its ok.
3.0,I LOVED the thickness and warmth of this jacket. It runs small so I ordered accordingly and thought it fit great and looked cute. The sleeves were a smidge long but I liked that because it covered my wrists/mittens so no cold air got in. The zipper is plastic and broke on me within 2 months of wearing it. It‚Äôs not a super expensive jacket so I can‚Äôt complain about the quality. I‚Äôd still be wearing it if the zipper hadn‚Äôt broke
3.0,Weird fit around the crotch. And it does not come with the laces in it. So annoying. Returned it
3.0,The shirt was bigger than I expected and it didn't look like the picture.
3.0,Doesn't look as I thought it would.
3.0,"Bracelet was very cute, however the stitch charm fell off after only a few days.  üòû. Disappointed to lose the charm, but the bracelet is nice overall."
3.0,"These &#34;jeans&#34; would be 5 stars if it weren't for the very strong bleachy/mothball smell!! I've washed them twice, used in-wash &#34;smell good&#34; beads, and they still have a strong odor. If the smell doesn't go away with one more wash, I guess I'll send them back."
3.0,"Very cute boots, exactly as shown in picture.  I didn‚Äôt it rate it 5 stars because after 2 days of my daughter wearing the front toe part is already peeling off - scuffs. But they aren‚Äôt leather boots so it should have been expected. Overall, very cute !"
3.0,"I have purchased Grace Karin skirts in the past, however I found that this skirt material was much thinner than what I am used to. The fit and length were perfect for me however I felt that the material needed to be a better quality."
3.0,it fits but for some reason these pants will ride up so I have to pull it down. I dont think I need a bigger size because its not tight on my thighs or hip. Just a weird fit
3.0,The black lining on the inside of the hat shows around the edges of the hat when you have it on.  It really detracts from the whole look!
3.0,These were really adorable I love them but they run really big ......down size for sure....
3.0,Wire sticks out from the back of your head.  You look stupid and don't know it until someone tells you.
3.0,"This is not the product in the picture. The sleeves are super small and not round like in the picture. This was the only reason I chose this seller, for this round kimono sleeves. But no. Shipping was fast. But I‚Äôm returning it."
3.0,"The necklace is just ok, and the 2 bracelets that came with it look like items you can buy from the vending machine. I feel like this gift set should have been worth less than $10 altogether at most. Even the packaging is very cheap. I'm not sure why it is such a sought-after gift set on Amazon. I wish I could have used my money to buy something better than this."
3.0,"They're all right.  They fit well and they feel good.  My issue with this is I don't think there's a front or back in the design of these.  When I first put them on they felt like they were on backwards.  I checked and they were definitely on right, but they just didn't feel right so I took them off and flipped them around and it was the same fit.  The seam you see in the front is just a design - there's no actual stitching there, which is fine, but they fit the same regardless of the direction you wear them.  My opinion is these are very androgynous underwear and can be sold as mens or womens.  In fact my wife loved them and I have ordered a set for her - she's very excited about them.  For me, I prefer to have a little more room in the front for my &#34;stuff&#34;.  I have had them on all day and I'm used to them now, it was just a little bit of a transition.  My wife gives them TEN stars for herself.  3 stars from me for the goofy fit.<br /><br />I'm 6'0&#34; 210#, size 34 waist.  I ordered XXL - PERFECT!!"
3.0,"Soft, warm. But run small."
3.0,The earrings are not as vivid as the picture. They are very faded.
3.0,"It looked better in the photo. Not unhappy because the price was OK. I thought maybe it was going look better but I like nice scarves. This was just okay. Ran into issues as to where to return it. Not Amazon, not local mail store...after finding out I would have to go to yet a different UPS store I had boyfriend pull over where a homeless lady was standing in the cold rain by the store. I gave her the scarf and $5 because I would feel like a jerk just giving her the scarf. And a buck doesn't even buy a hot dog.<br />Anyway for the $11 I paid I at least did a good deed."
3.0,"Beautiful, but not for daily use. One rhinestone petal fell off after 2 weeks of wear."
3.0,"It's a pretty dress, but the quality isn't that great. The stitching is already coming out under the chest, after one wear. It doesn't quite look like the picture either. It's not bad for the price."
3.0,Product style and material were ok. I wish the cotton material would have been softer.  I swear I ordered a small but maybe I made a mistake. So they were personally to large for me so I can not comment on size of fit.  Personally would not place another order for a correct size I would buy a different brand
3.0,it was beautiful.  But it broke the first day.
3.0,Super cute but after I washed it some of the fringes became stretched or ruined in general. Probably need to turn inside out and wash on gentle or just handwash to be safe.
3.0,"It's a nice enough band, but they need to do something about the extra bit of material. It makes it extremely difficult to lock the band in as the material covers and blocks the hole. I had to trim it just a small bit with scissors which I shouldn't have to do with a new product.<br /><br />That aside, it looks pretty good and feels like it'll hold up decently enough. Will update down the road if it breaks down or anything like that."
3.0,Casual wear it‚Äôs a little short for tall people.
3.0,"The small loop immediately after the buck broke in the first week of use,  it‚Äôs still usable.  Looks good, comfortable."
3.0,These would be comfy to lounge around in but not suitable for excercise üòï
3.0,I received this mask today. So far I really like it as it has adjustable strings for your ears. It is a little larger than expected but I am a petite person. With the adjustable strings im able to get a better fit (just a little loose under the chin). It also has a carbon filter for added protection.
3.0,Esta bien logrado pero no tan buena calidad.
3.0,"It's a good little watch for the price I have no complaints. But it's very small and I have the strap on the 4th notch... it has me wondering if this isn't in fact a ladies' watch. Very easy to set the time, date and alarm. The light is nearly useless."
3.0,I do love the material but wish it were actually a maxi dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and it lands several inches above my ankle and I like my dresses long. The hem is so small that it wouldn‚Äôt really make a difference if I took it out.
3.0,"The bands are great and durable. However, they were not for me. I did not like the thickness of the band with the size of my watch. I have the 44 and the band just looked to narrow for me."
3.0,"I really liked the look and appearance of this tennis bracelet . I used it a couple of times  but started having problems with the clasp ,which now doesn't  close."
3.0,This Item came with two broken flowers.
3.0,for the price it's alright it is really small~not much room for layering~pretty in color.
3.0,"Not my favorite Smartwool. I found these kinda hot. Would have returned them, but I'm lazy!"
3.0,"It's cozy and sexy, and fits well, but it's most definitely NOT burgundy and not remotely the color shown. It's a heather purplish pink. Cute, but not what I needed. I'm keeping it because I still like it but it isn't as advertised."
3.0,"I was disappointed in thia dress.  It fits a little on the small side, which is to be expected, but the bottom portion of the dress is quite sheer.  I bought it to wear to church and it will require a slip under it to make it work."
3.0,"TO walk around the house no rugs, do they have a larger size."
3.0,Snug.
3.0,"The nice thing about this dress is that it has an hourglass shape and that is stretchy. But overall it is the very cheap dress. It is made of a very thin see-through polyester material and the stitching of the dress was bad. There was stitching over the zipper that I had to cut to open up a zipper. When it comes to the side thing, if you are between sizes, go down since it stretches and it'll hug your body better."
3.0,Material was of good quality but the dress was too long. Was not able to wear it for my event. Still hanging in the closet with tags. Wish you offered petites!
3.0,this is a Christmas gift so i havent given them to him yet.
3.0,"I wanted to give these 5 stars, but after only 6 months of use the frame broke.  I bought these for my husband this past Christmas.  He loved them and they fit him great.  He has a big head and he said this was the first pair of sunglasses that didn't dig into his temples.  I guess sitting in the car was too much for these sunglasses.  The frame broke and my husband is not rough with his sunglasses.  He mainly kept these in his car and only wore them to and from work.  I had hoped these would last him longer, but I guess the old saying is true...&#34;you get what you pay for&#34;."
3.0,"This scarf looks well made and beautiful,but it's so itchy. I have to return it, because I can't put it on my skin. Doesn't feel like Alpaca to me. Very course wool."
3.0,"These aren't bad. They're almost there. The fit is fine. They're comfortable enough. It's really just the waistband that's getting to me. For something with such a chunky tie at the waist, you'd think that it would have an equally chunky waistband. But it has one of those really tiny pieces of elastic that bunches up in odd ways.<br /><br />The slit is also faked. There's a little bit of a slit in them, but it's mostly just an additional piece of fabric to make them look more flowy, without actually having any swishability to them. I thought about removing some of the stitching, but that didn't seem worth it for such a cheap pair of pants!"
3.0,"Really cute but SUPER see through. Wearing a shirt underneath doesn't really make a difference unless it has a high neck as well, because where it is most see through is in the chest. I wouldn't wear it on its own. It is a shame to have to always wear it under another sweater because it is very cute. It is a bit short (and I am only 5'2) but other than that, fits well. I was afraid it would be too small in the chest (36D) but thankfully it is not at all! Slightly itchy but bearable; hoping that improves with multiple washes."
3.0,The item was a little on the smaller size but this will be used for my baby's Halloween costume so it really didn't matter. Over all the quality of the item is good. Color is exactly like the picture.
3.0,These fit small and pinch the nose quite a bit. There is little room to stretch or bend them.
3.0,Beautiful style and look but was tarnished when I received
3.0,"Bonito producto, pero se ponen feos, pelados y dejan el dedo de color verde la piel al usarlo varias veces o lavarse las manos con ellos"
3.0,"These look exactly as pictured. Very cute, but run wide. The length fit as expected, but my LO's feet came right out of them when she tried to walk. So sad she can't wear these!"
3.0,"It is really pretty and it shipped very quickly, but it is bulky and heavy so it does not really sit right. It bends down if that makes sense."
3.0,Not a lot of stretch too small but sooooo cute
3.0,"Ordered the blue. Was just a pretty blue with large chunks of glitter, definitely not an opal pattern. Looked tacky, so returning. Good overall quality, though. Seemed sturdy."
3.0,Dress is nice but not for my body
3.0,I like it but the length is weird
3.0,Cute skirt but snags easily.
3.0,"The socks are very comfortable and warm however, I have thick calves and they do not come up to the knee. They make it about mid calf. Just for measurement I have 18in calves."
3.0,"I think this is an attractive looking dress, but the one I got is too too snug.  I did pay attention to sizing, but still this is just too snug of a cut for me.  I will have to return it."
3.0,Great inexpensive jeans.
3.0,top was a little small 34B but manageable - wore it on cruise and many compliments
3.0,Very pretty. These run like crazy and are very delicate. Don't plan to wear them more than once. They are the consistency of cheep. Pantyhose.
3.0,"I bought this because I wanted a light, airy summer dress that I can get away with wearing either casually or dressy. But this dress is so heavy, which can be a good thing if that's what you're looking for! It has a nice thick lining so that it is not see through at all. I wanted a more flowy dress. It's not a bad dress, just not for me."
3.0,Kept rolling down...super frustrating as I had high hopes for these.
3.0,Once I washed them they shrunk! They fit nice and loose and comfy before- then 5 minutes in dryer to get lint off and they became a different pair. Sad bc they were higher rise and comfy for being a massage therapist finding good bendable loose fit pants has been difficult. I'll still wear them around the house or a walk.
3.0,"I like the cover a couple things I dislike is the logos dont match up across steering wheel so my OCD is going to act up some lol. And if your worried about it not being a tight fit I feel as I worked out at the gym getting it on my steering wheel, once on it isn't going anywhere lol"
3.0,The elastic around the bottom of this dress prohibited me from walking freely and comfortably.  I went to return the item at the UPS Store and the label did not work.  I was forced to spend $12.78 to return the item. The seller exhibited great customer service by refunding my money for the returned along with the money spent for postage ($12.78).
3.0,Nice but bulky. Not as expected.
3.0,"It's nice but didn't last very long. The look holding the lanyard on to the ID card holder broke after 4 months and now I need to replace it. Sad, because it's otherwise a nice product."
3.0,"Broken threads is my biggest complaint.  I will need to do sewing on the front seam and the hems.<br /><br />Long rise from crotch to waist band, so I have to roll it down."
3.0,"So let me be real with you! I for real feel like I just lost 8 pounds trying to put this bad boy on. Definitely two sizes smaller, but ya know I'll still try to put myself into it just to make sure it doesn't fit. I'm sweating hard from the workout this tummy mummy gave me. I feel like I just got done exercising for 30 mins. I'm gonna go busty belly out of this prison and return it for a bigger size lol"
3.0,"I bought 3 different sizes of this bra in 3 different times.  First time I ordered in the same size I am supposed to wear, and it is too tight even with the extender.  Then I ordered two sizes larger after reading comments, and it was too large.  The band was ok, but the cup size is too big.  Since I like this bra, so I ordered the between sizes at the third time thinking it might fit perfectly.  Result...the cup size is ok, but the band is tight.  So I have to wear it with the extender.  At least, I found the size that I can wear."
3.0,"I am not crazy about this top. I like the fabric and the flowery pattern, but the cut is just weird. Maybe if I got a few sizes bigger... I wear S and I bought S and it feels tight. It makes my hips look very wide. Plus this top is not very &#34;forgiving&#34;. If you have some &#34;imperfections&#34; it will show big time. Size up."
3.0,Quality directly proportional to the price you pay.
3.0,The packaging said size 6 and the bottom of the flip flops says size 37.  There is a discrepancy. It should be size 36 in European units. They are big for me.
3.0,I usually wear. Medium and got the L  for comfort. It is right.
3.0,"was to small, gave it to my granddaughter, she loved it"
3.0,Got it in 4 days that was good .ring is good on size fills good on like it but the pink is not to pink not a good camo .I like it o wanted the pink to pop out and look camo thats not the look but it a nice band.
3.0,"This is the teeny tiniest charm I have ever seen (seriously, I needed a magnifying glass to see it.) The box it was shipped in was 8&#34; x 11&#34; x 4&#34;. Imagine my surprise when I finally got to the charm inside the box only to find that it was the size of 1/4 of a postage stamp. I REALLY want a charm that says &#34;SAY YES&#34; so I'll keep it...but it's kind of ridiculous."
3.0,Got a &#34;3xl&#34; I think it was a large is US size but it was too small. I usually wear a large in tops bc of my breast. This product runs small.
3.0,Picture is inaccurate.  The item is see thru.
3.0,Fine in quality but returned.  Did not fit my watch.
3.0,"Fit is okay, fabric a little thin , looks like it will snag when caught on something and seems like it will get fuzzy when washed."
3.0,About one size too small
3.0,"The shirt was very large but the pants fit as expected. I love the shirt, the pants immediately faded in the wash. A cute play outfit. For the price, you can expect much more."
3.0,Super cute skirt. It runs small in size. The button is fake..looks like you can button the skirt but there is no hole.
3.0,Looks more like a star than a starfish -- overpriced for what it is.<br />The blue is very pretty.
3.0,"I got exactly what is described: a set of VERY THIN, soft, attractive headbands.<br /><br />I liked the light orange color and thought it would go with several of my workout shirts.<br /><br />But I am a profuse sweater when I run, and I doubt these will do the trick on anything but the shortest runs on the coolest days. They're just too thin to absorb all that much sweat. I'll have to ring 'em out at every drink break, most likely.<br /><br />A better bet would be Cosmos's headband products that are packaged with the wristbands. Those headbands are thicker and much more absorbent. The wristbands are useless for my purposes, but the headbands are superior."
3.0,Fit was not acceptable to me. I tried the watch on but strapped was too long for me.
3.0,The hat was nice and I got a few compliments. Just seemed to be a little uneven to me. Maybe if I steamed it and molded it a little bit I was pressed for time. Overall I like it but I had a specific look I was going after.
3.0,"Fits like it should , don't wear it on a windy day!"
3.0,The XL size is much too small for a size 12. Probably fit a 10 1/2 or 11.<br />Quality seems just OK - bear in mind they are low priced and you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I wear a size 14, these are to small and the only way I can get them to stay up is to wear them as capris.<br />They are nice, soft and heavy fabric."
3.0,"I ordered FFLMYUHULIU Women's Sexy Split Floral Off-Shoulder Beach Party Maxi Dress (C2602-navy) in a medium (5‚Äô 7‚Äù, 34 bust and 30‚Äù waist). At first glance, it looked great and the material felt comfortable. After trying it on, I could tell that it would‚Äôve been a light and comfortable dress to wear for a summer wedding. The length was perfect for my height, it hit just at my feet and still looked nice with heals on. The waist was comfortable and wasn‚Äôt tight on me. Unfortunately, and my reason for having to return this dress and the 3 stars is the top does not fit correctly. After having the halter buttoned and the back tied, one side of the top fit perfectly with no cleavage showing but the other side left a huge gap. I tried with a bra on and a bra off and the gaping did not change. My boobs are not uneven to cause this. It‚Äôs a defect in how the top was made. Exchanging for a smaller size wouldn‚Äôt work since the waist on the medium fit me perfectly."
3.0,Way to long run small
3.0,Im a female with small hands so the small was too small. but it's very warm and water proof.
3.0,Was smaller than all my other mediums. Quality was good.
3.0,Item was supposed to include removable pockets for the hand warmers. The pockets were not included.  Nice gloves.
3.0,"I was so excited about this top. I wear small to medium normally. Based on the sizing chart, I bought the small. The fit was a perfect! The fabric is light weight and slightly stretchy. The color I ordered is Y Purple Floral, which is beautiful on the screen, but did not turn out to look purple at all. The large flowers are more of a bright pink. I still like it, but would have preferred the purple/magenta colors. The touches of gray, teal, and turquois are similar to the picture."
3.0,Need to buy 2 sizes up.. Small
3.0,"Very cute dress, it kind of looks like a night gown though... the material is slightly see through. There is no lining in the dress. The corset and tie part of the dress is adorable. You can wear the sleeve on your shoulders or hanging off. This is a very pretty dress I think it would prettier with accessories and I do wish it wasn‚Äôt see through."
3.0,They broke the third prime I wore them when I took them off to clean the lens
3.0,short socks.
3.0,"Very pretty, chain very nice, butterfly too big for me. Packaging very very nice. It made a great gift to a friend."
3.0,Not as handy at it appears.  Bulky and in the way.
3.0,"I have this exact same style in black and the fabric is soft and flowy. This gray color is made of a stiffer feeling fabric and it didn't fit as well. Returned it. (size small, 5'3, 109 lbs)"
3.0,"I usually wear a 2x, but ordered a 3x based on previous reviews. Bodice fit perfect, but skirt was about 4 inches too long (I'm 5' 5&#34;) The belt was not a coordinating color -  more of fluorescent pink that anything. Oddly, there are no belt loops. Had there been belt loops, I could have managed by moving the elastic waist higher up, but without belt loops the belt just went wherever it felt. Returned item."
3.0,"I would suggest ordering a couple sizes larger then what you wear, Some stretch but not a lot"
3.0,"The dress itself was beautiful; however, be sure to order 1-2 sizes up. Dress was very short even though my mom wears a medium and we bought an x-large, dress was short. She had to buy an extra bit of black material and stitch to the bottom of the dress to lengthen it."
3.0,"What I like best about these earrings is that it has its own clasp attached to wear them.  They look really cute and are lightweight.  Great for teens or as a gift.  Inexpensive but nice.  What I didn't like was the clasp broke after 1 week and within 2 weeks started to fade in color. I had to polish them with clear nail polish to get them to last longer but for the buck, it still was a fair buy."
3.0,fit Is just a bit small
3.0,The necklaces are really pretty and the colors are very nice but one of the gems fell off from the sun necklace when I first opened it.
3.0,"The pants are somewhat small, it fits more like leggings than jeggings. They are okay."
3.0,"The hoodie looks nice, but while we expected a medium for a teenager or junior, it was a kids medium and didn't fit.  My daughter wants to give it to a friend.  I'm not impressed."
3.0,"Fits a little snug, somewhat see through."
3.0,needed to order a large which fit--I usually wear a medium
3.0,stone fell out when I opened the package
3.0,Gave it away. Ordered large and sized between small and medium. Gave it away
3.0,Emblem and earings too small for even medium size man
3.0,Material is polyester and doesn't breath well. Looks okay.
3.0,"I have owned a few automatic watches, and I must say that for $50 this is the bargain of the decade.<br /><br />This watch offers moonphase day date and an Tourbillon peep all while seeming to have a decorated movement! and a display clear back so you can see the seemingly decorated rotor. All this for under $50 there must be a catch.<br /><br />Well of course there is<br /><br />You don't get the box in the pictures but the watch does exactly looks like the one on the pictures. You don't get real pushers but recessed pushers which are a pain to use (the screw looking parts next to the crown on the right side of the watch). You can use a pen or something similar to click them and switch the weekday and date.<br /><br />There is also no seconds hand which I miss and there is also no hacking. To continue with the downsides the finishing patter on the dial doesn't allows for the numbers to be painted properly or as well and you can see in the pictures some of this. Mine came with a paint spot just next to the 9 numeral and it's just a stain. At least you can barely see it but it's there.<br /><br />The crown action is horrible, there is a middle step which does absolutely nothing ( you would expect date adjustment but that is what the pusher do ). The last step allows you to set the time. The clock does features manual winding within the resting position of the crown.<br /><br />To cap all the previous points what seems to be a beautifully decorated movement or at least the rotor isn't. It's actually a decorated piece of metal glued to the rotor. If you see the rotor from the side you can see the layer of decoration on top of the actual rotor. I would have been fine with just a stamped decorated with the brand name rather than a fake decorated rotor glued on top/<br /><br />The leather strap is rather underwhelming but honestly it's a $50 watch, there are straps that are more expensive, so there you go.<br /><br />There is also a big thing for me that I didn't noticed in the pictures. The dial seems to be in 2 parts and there is one in top of the Tourbillon and that can be easier seen in person I will update with pictures later.<br /><br />Conclusion is that this is a pretty watch, for the price looks amazing works and has a beautiful decorated movement to the untrained eye but keep in mind how it really is."
3.0,"I really loved this online and thought I would wear it all the time. I had it sitting in my closet waiting to be worn, but I never went for it. It fits well, it is a little cheap but nothing worse than SheIn quality. It's just a bit awkward how its cut, I thought I would love it. Unfortunately could not return because I waited too long. I've worn it once, keep in mind I don't hate it, theres nothing wrong with it. Just thought it would be a more loved item."
3.0,"I bought this belt in a medium, as that is normally my size, but it is way too small. I would suggest you size up.<br /><br />I bought it as part of a cosplay costume so it works for that but it is a little stiff and I'm unsure how it would work for an every day belt."
3.0,"I've had these bibs for a few months and have been on numerous rides. I ride 3 times a week and average close to 100 miles a week. They fit true to size. The band at the knee holds well without squeezing my leg. The material feels great, very smooth. I really like the chamois, great for long rides. The overall straps sit well and are comfortable for my torso. I like the concept of being able to pull them down for bathroom breaks, but in practice it's not favorite. While riding the back of the bib is so low cut that only my longest jerseys keep everything covered. I've started to apply sunscreen to my lower back for fear of a very strange sunburn! I worry about what is showing when I'm in the pace line. I'll wear these out, but I won't be buying another pair."
3.0,It's nice but the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight.  I have thin arms and it's awkward when I try to push up the sleeves.  Otherwise it fits okay.  It is roomy everywhere but in the sleeves.
3.0,Not a fan.  Would have returned if I hadn't taken the tags off.  Cheap looking and way too big
3.0,"The skirt is very long and I have to have it shortened ,  and that makes the skirt  more expensive. In the picture you show the skirt with a side split , but the split is really in the back. Unless you want to have the side seam of the skirt run down the front of your stomach.  Like I said I like the skirt but it turned out to be more trouble and extra dollars.  By the way I'm 5'4 ."
3.0,"It is a little tight around the chest.  I am a 40DD.  I did order my normal size, but their sizing is off a bit and on the smaller size. Should have gone up one size.<br />Light flowy material.  Color is spot on. Very pretty tank blouse.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the creases from packaging.  I can't get the lines out whatsoever!<br />I've tried hand washing it, and letting it hang to dry.<br />Tossed it in the dryer on cool setting, and still lines.<br />Not sure if an iron will take out these deep creases though."
3.0,"One of the tips of the stone was broken.<br />The stone is hanging on one side of the tunnel making it lopsided, tilting it forward as you wear it<br /><br />Not cute"
3.0,"This band was a bit wide for my tracker so it was a bit hard to put on. It seems to be well made and is soft and is comfortable, however it is very short so it is tight."
3.0,It ran a little small and seemed to shrink on top of that
3.0,"Beautiful material and design.<br />The size was extremely much larger than expected.  I ordered a 3x, but a 2x would have been a better fit.<br />I will keep it an adjust the fit."
3.0,"Narrower than most Clark‚Äôs, and the shape wears really blah. They look way cuter in the pic than in person."
3.0,Size was off you must go 1 or 2 sizes bigger than what you wear ring was nice though.
3.0,Nice but very small!
3.0,The shirts run small.  Otherwise great quality.
3.0,Not a perfect replacement for garmin watch but works.
3.0,I am 5‚Äô2 131lbs. I bought a medium hoping it would be a little loose. The arms fit like a medium (bunches at the wrists) but the torso fits like a small. The length goes just beneath the zipper on a pair of jeans.
3.0,"I know they give you the size but these are small, good castings but again small"
3.0,"I bought this to see how it would fit me,  a medium small man.  It was ok. Basic."
3.0,"I ordered a large since I read some of the comments, the material is nice but the shoulder part is tight and it's not comfortable, I will have to fix it myself."
3.0,Product was ok just size runs small
3.0,Ran too small to wear
3.0,Splitting the difference. It is a good size/build wristlet. I find it unlikely it is authentic.  So if you aren't brand-monogamous it's a great bag. If you are all about the brand keep shopping
3.0,Like the shirt but is a tad bit wide
3.0,Cute dress. Fits well. Color anf ruffle type different from picture.
3.0,Order up...run small
3.0,"I ordered the white one, the colors are cute but I'm disappointed by the size, the pendant is very small. Not as big as I thought it would be. It is about half of my pinky, maybe even less. So if you want a big pendant I would not recommend this."
3.0,For a friend. this is what she indicated.
3.0,"Cute design. Good material, but tight on the ankles. And I have small ankles."
3.0,"I believed the reviews and bought a medium when they said this ran small, but it really doesn't! The medium was massive on me and I'm 5'4&#34;, 120 pounds with a size 32DD bra. It is cute though."
3.0,"Fits everywhere except for my shoulders. Not something you should buy if you have broad shoulders, unless they have sizes available."
3.0,"I know I only gave it 3 stars, but that's because of the price.  I think it far too expensive for what it is.  That being said it works as needed."
3.0,Great shirt for the price. The arm holes are supppper tight and I even have tiny arms. I mean like so tight I had to stretch them over some canned veggies and leave for a few days to loosen up. I thought I could deal with the tightness for a date night but an hour into dinner it felt like my arms were tingling. Not even sure if sizing up would have helped. But I mean it's still a cute shirt. Beauty is pain.
3.0,Bastante transparente la tela.
3.0,"Had it not been too tight it would have been great. I liked the color, style and materials. I had to return it."
3.0,"i liked the watch, but i could not get the clasp to open. too bad . i might buy again"
3.0,"Cute design, very thin (I expected doubled up fabric). Good enough for the price."
3.0,"Likes: They look fine.<br />Dislikes: Super tight from top to bottom, making them difficult to put on with socks. FYI, the insoles included in the box are meant to replace the ones in the shoes after those break down a bit. They aren't for immediate use."
3.0,I am top heavy so it doesn‚Äôt fit well. Good quality material for the price. It‚Äôs not flattering on me.
3.0,"Love the charm, but chain will most likely break."
3.0,"The plates should be at least twice as thick. Can bend with my thumb and forefinger. However, it makes a nice display piece."
3.0,"the back is blank,"
3.0,"They were cute, a little heavy. Sometimes it felt like I had a necklace on backwards. Only gave 3 stars cause one broke after first time wearing it."
3.0,"Ok watch, but it's even thicker than it looks in some of the photos and the crown is really hard to adjust. Ended up returning it immediately as I think I'll stick with Skagen watches in the future. IMO those are far sleeker."
3.0,"It took awhile but they finally arrived they are very cute ,for the price I exspected them  not to look as as nice as they do"
3.0,Stringy
3.0,"its not think enough, not sure i want to keep it at this point"
3.0,The shoulders part was very tight. And also the length of the arms were short.
3.0,"Dress was really interesting. But- most notable was the hole that appeared to be noted and patched with expertise ‚Ä¶ but with white thread. Though not enough to fix entire hole. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the hole but for the white thread, Second- there is no zipper, it goes over your head. So really, measure your shoulders to get dress over. Will put a lot of strain on the sweater, which is why the hole in the shoulder/arm  is alarming.<br />I am going to try again and size up, to get over my shoulders and the top is a form fitting sweater material. I just might  pay seamstress to put in a zipper too. It is not 2 piece- sweater and dress sewn together.<br />Dress is really pretty and different. This brand is really spot on with cool pieces."
3.0,Stayed in place in the beginning but then I guess stretched and started to go down when my baby crawled. Once I put in washer it kind started to unsew itself
3.0,"The clear ones are awful, nearly impossible to close and open themselves almost immediately. The rest work fine."
3.0,"These were supposed to be a gift.  Picture showed regular lenses but they are mirrored.  I see now in the description they have added this information (but it's mirror, not mirrow), which I have to give credit for.  Recipient did not expect and could not use mirrored type, so full refund was promptly given by seller, which I also give credit for the hassle-free return/refund process."
3.0,"Nothing wrong with the product, they were slightly to narrow to fit my glasses, I returned them."
3.0,"One of the necklaces was broke, got 2 of the pink gem necklace and 2 of the star necklace was hoping to get the ones that were pictured  which were all different, very disappointed."
3.0,"the ring is very nice, but the letters peel off after a while and they can hurt other fingers or clothing when you rub against the ring."
3.0,"If I could I'd give this 2.5 stars. It looks attractive. However, the outside edge of the silver that holds the bands together sticks out a bit and is very sharp. I only wore it for a day before I realized the danger of cutting myself or something. Disappointed that I can't recommend."
3.0,Not the same quality as flojos but will work
3.0,"I like the prints, but not the material, fits nicely just hope neckline is a little lower. Just my own opinion."
3.0,The item fit lower and more snug than I liked. It also came damaged with a hole in the knee and it has a stain on it.
3.0,"Quick delivery, more pink than red"
3.0,"The dress concept is overall cute and nice quality, however when I received mine it smelled strange and was balled up in the bag. Obviously used."
3.0,Fits as expected but very thin material. On the other hand they are inexpensive.
3.0,Love it as a bathing suit cover. Customers were asking where to purchase one.
3.0,"Other then being short, tees are nicely painted and priced"
3.0,"They are super soft and comfy. No compression in the stomach area at all. Picks up pet hair and lint like crazy. Overall, I would say good house leggings. A tiny bit see through"
3.0,The Sox are okay they fit decently only problem is after a couple of wearing you start to get holes in the toe portion so you do get a good amount for the price but the quality could be somewhat better
3.0,"Beautiful outfit, but much too small for a large woman!"
3.0,The little silver were off when received. üò™
3.0,"First put them on and zipper got stuck and that was stressful!! The zippers kept getting stuck even when they were not on, I ended up returning them for a few reasons.  Not very comfortable, then the zippers getting stuck, I didn‚Äôt like how steep the heel was... Pro: The price was right and they were cute but not comfortable."
3.0,I gave 3 stars because it was late arrival but overall nice shirt.
3.0,Nice dress for the most part‚Ä¶Nice  material..2 things‚Ä¶The upper part of the dress hold breast cups.. They sit up way too high on my chest‚Ä¶Went to a seamstress to see if she could fix it and her exact words ‚Äúomg who‚Äôs breast are up there‚Äù‚Ä¶2nd the zipper was an issue‚Ä¶Just a bad one I‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶Would of gotten it fixed had I not had an issue with the chest part‚Ä¶
3.0,"Decent dress! VERY tight and color very bright. Not in love with it, so gave it to my cousin since the color looked a little too young for me."
3.0,"Nice size, but the already having problems with the zipper."
3.0,"A lightweight shoe for my almost 5 year old. One shoe is not as comfortable to her foot, but this wasn't noticed until after wearing a few times. Also, these shoes scuff easily and show wear and tear quickly. It will do, but I think there are better options from other brands or styles in this price range."
3.0,"you get what you pay for. I hate pocketbooks! Just the right size for what I was looking for, something small that could fit into anything and just enough space for cell phone, keys, lip gloss, small wallet, nice crossbody fit. Great for traveling without a full purse. Quality fair, thin leather, inside stitching could be better, flimsy zippers, but overall, it‚Äôs decent and low priced. Not sure how long it will last me but maybe in 6 months I‚Äôll update my review. If you don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of $$ but need something you can use on the go, maybe at a park, concert, or weekend trip without hassle, don‚Äôt expect the greatest quality for the price, but this nicely suits the need. I would recommend."
3.0,Not horrible but for me they are too big and I had a bad reaction from the metal pieces on the nose area! Will be giving away since I can‚Äôt wear ! But they are cute !
3.0,"Design is great for summer!<br />But i gave it 3 stars because of the fit. It runs somewhat small and snuggly. The cloth though is soft and the top looks nicely made. I bought color blue. So if you will order, order 1 size bigger. Then there will be no problem!"
3.0,The shirt color is cute (I got navy blue) and I like the texture of material but the fit is very boxy and wide. You have to tuck part of the shirt in to make it look decent. If you leave the entire shirt untucked it looks like you're wearing a triangle...it just sort of hangs out and doesn't fot around the waist.
3.0,Cute swimsuit!  The top was too small but the bottoms were just right.
3.0,"The outfit is so cute and looks adorable . I have twin boys so I ordered two . With that being said . They outfits are bigger , so it's not true to fit . I was OK with that bc that means more time to wear it . The patches on the pants are very cheap and poorly sewn on. To my surprise they have withheld a couple of washes now. Both the shirt and pants are very thin material. I haven't have issues with the words in the shirt fading as of yet."
3.0,Quality good just too small
3.0,"I disliked that the material is thin. I thought it would be a bit thicker, especially for the price I paid for it."
3.0,Love the texture but the bottom is not as big around as the top so it does not cover as much as i would have liked
3.0,"These are great...except the snap popped off one of them the FIRST time we wore them. We actually still use them, but have to use a safety pin to close the broken one. They are super warm and cozy. The best thing about them is that they fit for a long time; they stay on small feet and can stretch for bigger feet. My LO is pretty chunky and we didn't have any of the ankle bruising a few reviewers mentioned. If the snap had stayed on I would have given them 5 stars."
3.0,"I loved this. It's cute and a lightweight material. But as far as the fit goes it's lacking. Ladies if you are well endowed (busty!!) and have a longer torso this is not for you. I'm 5'8 and I squeezed into it. Maybe a size up would be better, but I doubt it."
3.0,I wasn‚Äôt really that impressed with the material.... for $30 it would have been nice if it wasn‚Äôt polyester BUT my son was smiling and that‚Äôs ALL that matters.
3.0,"Love the fabric and style , just feel like the sizes run small and had to return it for that reason"
3.0,"I wear a US 12, so I ordered XXL.  The pants fit in the hips, a bit tight in the waist, but the top was very small.  Super pretty colors, but very thin fabric.  returning."
3.0,"Very nice material, but it fits smaller than expected.  I plan to keep it for when I lose a few more pounds."
3.0,Really cute but a little smaller than sizing states - it is well made with good firm fabric so size up if you are deciding which size will fit.
3.0,I bought these in October and and put them in rotation with my other pajamas. Last night I put on the dark plaid pair and found there was a 2 inch opening in the left leg inseam. This should not be happening even after 2 months. If my return date hadn‚Äôt passed they would have been returned. Not happy.
3.0,"The watch is great. The band is a little large, but I'm okay with that. Having said that, it's 6 months since the purchase and one of the links is broken."
3.0,Watch came with a dead battery.  I will just have to replace the battery. Maybe this is an old model.
3.0,"I wanted to try these for driving because of the copper gradient lens tint, since my car's windshield is tinted. Though I have not yet used them for driving, I do like the tint gradient and how snugly they fit my narrow face (if you have a &#34;full&#34; face, the will likely be too tight). I gave them 3-stars because they do not appear to be very durable and because I have not used them enough to give them a complete review. Overall, they are about the quality of what I expected for the price and the lens tint color and gradient are what I wanted."
3.0,I should‚Äôve got a size up.
3.0,These were very small for an adult and tight.
3.0,Fits good but the material is a little cheap. It won't last a for long. Won't by it again.
3.0,"Cute, but absolutely not worth the price. The plastic feel weak and cheap. I could have gotten the same pair at the dollar store. The case it came on though is pretty study."
3.0,They hold up great and fit just as expected. The only downside is some times the band will detach from the watch.
3.0,I am still trying to figure out if this thing really works on watches. It definitely demagnetized other stuff such as screwdrivers though.
3.0,The colors of this kimono are very pretty. The kimono is too tight fitting.
3.0,Smaller than expected on the bottom half but still cute and feels like quality. I would order a size up if you have thick booty and thighs
3.0,"The part of the closure that goes through the ear lobe is quite thick, but the earrings are nice looking."
3.0,"The black belt fit best, the tan and white were smaller and I didnt like that because I'm not a small size woman"
3.0,Extra large bought fits like a medium. I'm 5'10 and have a larger chest.
3.0,I love this dress but everytime I wear it one of the buttons falls off and NO I‚Äôm not doing anything crazy to cause it. Just cheaply sewn on buttons.
3.0,I really want to love this shirt but it's just a little too short and a bit too boxy. Otherwise nice.
3.0,"This thing took its time coming from China. When it came, the width was correct but the width of curved ends was not! My watch guy was not able to install this with curved ends attached. As a result, the band fits differently than I hoped (and looked for)."
3.0,This is no way true to size. The large barely fits my bust or hips. I'm not sure if I'll exchange for a larger size or just return it.
3.0,Its much much smaller than I had hoped for. Kinda expensive for the size. Quality is nice though.
3.0,Gloves are like an xxxxxxl way big. I mean huuuge!!
3.0,This is an xl. It said to order up if you wanted a looser fit but I don't want it to look like a moomoo.
3.0,It was good except the silver cross came off the first day of my husband wearing it
3.0,Can't even get the backs on. Post is too small. One ball I can't even unscrew off post.
3.0,"Loved the box and initially loved the bracelet. Then I noticed one of the &#34;obsidian&#34; stones was chipped. I wouldn't have minded that; it was the fact that there was white plastic underneath that bothered me.<br /><br />As costume jewelry it would have been no biggie. But I was looking for what was advertised: GENUINE stones. Very disappointed, but still I give it at least 3 stars for the elegant packaging, study make, and overall beautiful bracelet. Just wish it had been real."
3.0,rather snug around the calf
3.0,This are not 18G as described
3.0,This swim suit is wayyy too small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 170 lbs. I normally wear a large in swimsuits and I got an xl in this. It fits more like a medium. It squeezed me in all the wrong places lol. The top is not for bustier women. It‚Äôs super cute and seems like good quality material so I‚Äôm bummed that it didn‚Äôt work out.
3.0,Cancelled my order
3.0,"At first I was delighted with the band - I was tired of the silicon and wanted something breathable. I loved the color and the stripes and the way it felt, but it got dirty so fast (weeding garden didn't help...) I scrubbed it and it cleaned up nicely, but just kept getting dirty, so I finally gave up and ordered another silicon one."
3.0,"Because of my wide shoulders I wear a size large for jackets and sweaters. But for this particular one, I had to get a XXL. It looks big but fits my shoulders better than the XL."
3.0,They slide off my hair all the time. That's my only bad review
3.0,fits as expected but the material starts drag. the least little thing touches it the thread starts coming loose
3.0,They are great looking. I have them with me at all times because they are comfortable and cool to wear.
3.0,I ordered these mainly for the safety pin earrings and they are way bigger than pictured. The only redeeming quality is the smaller oval hoops that I actually like. Pretty bummed
3.0,"They don‚Äôt really look like the photo a bit longer. I like them, I just ordered a way to big size. I‚Äôm 160 lbs usually like a 13 in jeans. Got in extra large and they are WAY to big probably could have fit a medium or large"
3.0,"There is nothing wrong with this product, I just find it completely useless.  Why does anyone use a money clip?<br /><br />Putting money into the clip and taking money out of the clip is slow and annoying.  A wallet works much better."
3.0,Color and fabric are nice but the mask is too small and tight to use for a normal man or woman and definitely wouldn't work for a larger adult.
3.0,I give 3 stars because it's not what i am expecting for. I wasn't able to wear this dress last holiday because if I do I look funny or hideous.
3.0,"After second wash on gentle , the fabric  has lots of tiny balls, smooth finish is gone."
3.0,Liked it. In person it looked a little ‚Äúcheap‚Äù as you can tell that the white and black pieces are separate. It‚Äôs a nice grab and go option but it may be better to invest in something better. No lining. Still very comfortable
3.0,Alterations are necessary as the size chart is not correct.
3.0,"Not great for hiking long trips. They didnt make my guy slip, but his feet were killing him half way though our walk. They are great for playing, look very cute on him, easy for him to get on and off though. Just would like to get a little more comfort. Great shoe for playing!"
3.0,The top is shorter then I'd like. But its super soft.
3.0,Coming apart after three months :(
3.0,Its cheapily made but has lasted for over a week now and it still is in one piece and works well with my style.
3.0,Only been using for 3 days. Haven‚Äôt gotten it wet so not certain the color won‚Äôt change or turn my skin green is the reason for the three stars. It is a beautiful piece and looks real. Will update later.
3.0,Cute shirt but runs small
3.0,Pretty dress. Tobkarge. Had snags in fabric.
3.0,"I bought 2 pair of Nevados, a pair of Klondikes and a pair of Boomerangs. The Klondike fit good and where comfortable. After 2 months I noticed the right shoe wore out very quickly and developed a hole in the bottom. Every time I wore them when the ground was wet my foot got wet. Not happy.  [[ASIN:B00J83HWZ6 Nevados Men's Klondike Mid Waterproof Hiking Boot, Earth Brown/Black/Tigerlily Orange, 10 M US]]"
3.0,"This fit incredibly large. I ordered a small and was swimming in it. Removed the craptastic lacing in the back and replaced with a zipper for better fit. Phil was way too big in the shoulders and in the bust. Also replace some of the cheaper lace that was hanging from the sleeves. Added my own applique and rhinestones to rich it out.<br /><br />The primary anger I have towards this costume is the fact that the brocade fabric frays like crazy and is prone to holes. I'm sure that the other non-metallic tone dresses are probably a little thicker. If this dress wasn't the one that was on sale and if I didn't have so much difficulty getting it here on time, I probably would have returned it for another color. But time was of the essence and I had to stick it out with my choice.<br /><br />But after putting around 30 hours of additional sewing and customizing into it, I did receive a lot of compliments on it and it was a very unique choice for the masquerade ball I attended."
3.0,Color says arctic blue picture shows a light blue.  I received a grey dark bluish color.  Not what I wanted.  But I have a couple of these sweatshirts and I do like them.
3.0,Value for cost  !!
3.0,These leggings are smooth and really bright and fun.  The waistband is a bit loose.  I wear shorts underneath so that my underwear doesn't show when i bend over.  I use them in high activity sports and feel more comfortable with shorts under them.
3.0,Its small. I have to roll it off my hand. I bought one for my boyfriend as well. I hope it stretches enough to go around his hand without breaking. I wasnt expecting the mens to be as small in size. The elactice holding it together is good. Still worried it will break when he puts it on.
3.0,"Very cute dress, but the quality isn‚Äôt great. The dress looks like it might tear at the seems after one more use."
3.0,FINE.
3.0,"Look at the photos of the least flatering fit... that's how this fit me. If you have a big chest and smaller waist you may get a better fit. I figured it would fit like my inexpensive shirt I bought at Target years ago. This Amazon shirt fits and feels like a silky men's athletic shirt. I'm in between a extra small and small. I wear a 32a and gaining more around the middle as I get closer to 40. I figured the small would hug on top and lose in the middle, but I got the complete opposite fit. I may try an extra small if they come out with one and see if it fits more like a hugging women's shirt rather a lose men's shirt"
3.0,"Medium fits me well. 5'7"", 36 C, 150lbs. Doesn't arrive with a warehouse smell."
3.0,Really square style..didn't like the fit. But the look of it is adorable.
3.0,"The glasses come with a a soft pouch, leatherette case, microfiber cleaning cloth and a keychain screwdriver (which you won't use since they have no removable parts).<br /><br />The nice selection of accessories aside, the glasses are acceptable at best. The nose bridge doesn't have any moving parts  (the hard plastic nose pads are held in place by metal and so they don't pivot). The checkered accents are cheaply printed on and being to fade with the lightest use.<br /><br />These make for a nice pair if junk glasses that you don't mind damaging or losing. They do what they're supposed to but it seems like they cut corners in making these and I wish the manufacturer spent more money on quality instead of unnecessary accessories.<br /><br />I've used these for about 6 months and regularly find myself thinking that they're are cheap. If you're looking for nice sunglasses, look elsewhere. If you just want something cheap and good enough, these will do."
3.0,Pretty dress but I ordered a size up and it was huge so had to return.
3.0,"This watch bracelet is a bargain at $17 and the included Quick Release Spring Bars (which are currently $7.99 on their own) are an added bonus.<br />What isn't immediately apparent from the pictures is that the central link-spacers are polished, which is a nice touch.<br />The bracelet was easy to fit and adjust and feels solid and secure on the wrist.<br />I was a bit skeptical about putting a &#34;cheap&#34; bracelet on my Tissot Automatic but I'm very happy with the results.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After 1 month of wear, the fold-over security clasp has become loose. It still clicks into place but doesn't provide a secure lock. I replaced this band with https://www.amazon.com/22mm-Stainless-Oyster-Straight-Bracelet/dp/B005XX0RHK/ref=sr_1_34?ie=UTF8&qid=1474815824&sr=8-34&keywords=22mm+watch+bracelet. This bracelet is over 3 times the cost of the TRUMiRR item but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Was a pain to put on and throughout the process i snapped the ear rest.<br /><br />the frequency of putting it on charge to then put it back on was difficult.<br /><br />To be frank, can't see anything out of them either.<br /><br />cool party trick i suppose."
3.0,"Took a gamble this would be the same tri-blend as sold in store today but was not.  It is 50/50 cotton-poly. Still a good soft, light weight(not see through) every day T-shirt; Relax fit.  Haven't washed to know if this blend will shrink."
3.0,"Super cute, it has a stranger material but still great!"
3.0,"One side is great but the back is just the print backwards. Fine for hanging on a wall, not so great for hanging off a pole from our house where each side will be visible. Otherwise the colors are vibrant and text is easy to read."
3.0,"I thought it would be t-shirt material, not a fan of the material, though that‚Äôs not a deal breaker.  However, it‚Äôs just too small.  Difficult to get over my head and too tight under the arms.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 150 lbs, small busted.  Have to return."
3.0,I thought the dress material did not flow with my body. the fabric is slightly stiff but still a decent dress for everyday
3.0,"It fit but was a little tight, I reccomend buying a size up. I'm usually a large and the XL barely fit me. I would wash before wearing, the coloring started to rub off on my skin after 2 days of wering it."
3.0,Product was ‚Äúok‚Äù. Logo could have been better and smelled awful. Quality of T-shirt not the best!
3.0,"These socks work as one would want them to. However the sock material is a little thin. Not uncomfortable, however if you are used to wearing a thicker sock then your shoes will be a little loose. My husband wears boots and wears a pair of socks. When wearing the compression socks they did great except they were Just too thin to wear with boots"
3.0,"The chain broke within 3 days of Wearing it, otherwise it was nice"
3.0,In less than 2 weeks the silver on the white heart came off the chair and the clasp on the black heart came apart :( The hearts are awesome and I love they are magnets but they should have used better materials.
3.0,"I would not buy from this seller again because there was no communication. I had to contact them twice through the weird Amazon messaging system and didn‚Äôt receive anything helpful. I wanted custom sizing and sent my measurements through the messaging but didn‚Äôt get confirmation of that they were going to make the dress custom. I had no idea what I was going to get until the dress showed up. That being said it fits perfectly ‚Äî if you‚Äôre on the fence about custom sizing, do it. My dress looks much better on than the other girls in the wedding party who picked an actual size. The corset is not my style but it works well and is forgiving if your weight fluctuates a little up or down. I‚Äôll definitely have to put sticky material on the shoulders because they will not stay up. The length was perfect as well!"
3.0,It took me less time to learn to braid than it did to master this tool.
3.0,The color is perfect and fit just slightly large. The fabric on the other hand awful - it's actually noisy.
3.0,"Nice style the fabric is quite thin though, a camisole would be required."
3.0,Very cute but way to small. I am 150 so I ordered extra large. It is just a little to form fitting for me. It fits very tight and just did not feel comfortable against the skin. It has a side zipper and elastic around the sleeve area. Felt more like a costume than a shirt to wear just to look cute.
3.0,Its good for kids but not for adults.
3.0,Looks cute but false advertising. The shirt is not velvet it‚Äôs a basic Long sleeve cotton shirt SMH. Tutu is cute though.
3.0,The color is a lot lighter than the picture.
3.0,material is cheap yet the picture is about right & fit's like that.
3.0,I got my shirt. I had ordered an XL because I saw reviews saying this ran small. Okay so I'm pretty sure I received an XL in men's or something because it was huge! I normally wear a large but I plan to reorder in a medium. It reminds me of Walmart's faded glory brand. The material felt cheap (because it is cheap lol) but it may have softened up in the wash. Who knows but we will see!
3.0,I ordered a size up and it was still too small. Very disappointed since it is cute but I cannot wear it.
3.0,"I ordered this hoping it would be loose and comfy but because I'm very long in the torso, it wasn't all that comfortable. I needed it to be a little longer/bigger. I ended up returning it -- I loved the material and the style, I just needed a little more space."
3.0,didnt fit my Oakley Frames... disappointed
3.0,"I bought this watch a few weeks ago, and I found that the black steel band and the case are easily scratched. They lose the beautiful black color and you can see the stainless steel color in the back. I love the watch and I wear it almost everyday, yet I think it's way to easy to scratch it. I thought it would be sturdier."
3.0,"its so cute, but not what iwas expecting.  the strap is thin nylon or polyester and it looks cheap. my fault for assuming it would be embroidered or sewn."
3.0,huge flare quality seem well I‚Äôve yet to get them in yet. I‚Äôm a fresh 00 for about and month and just get them to slip in. Also the varnish or whatever is on them comes off when using jojoba oil thought i was bleeding with no pain but just the stuff coming out. Thinking of sanding the flare down a bit
3.0,"This is a very pretty girl's dress.  Lovely in terms of the pattern, cut, and ruffle details.  Unfortunately the material is very thin and rather see-through making a slip necessary."
3.0,"It fit as hoped. I'm an XL and I can button it across my chest, so that's good. It says that it's hand wash only, that's annoying. But that material is not as soft (I thought more like flannel) as I expected but it's not flimsy by any means either. So overall it's a decent shirt at a decent price."
3.0,The biggest pair is about the size of a quarter
3.0,"Received two black scarves today. As others have mentioned, it is really long and bulky, but that is OK if that is what you want. The problem is that both of them have a 6&#34; zipper that was sewn shut at about the 4&#34; length - therefore not allowing the zipper to open past that point.. I had to cut open the stitching on top of the zipper to get it to open far enough to get a cell phone in the pocket. Not horrible for the price, but be prepared to do a little adjusting."
3.0,"They are nice cufflinks, but came with little scratches on then that can be seen in certain light."
3.0,"This was the second pair of these pants I ordered.  Previous pair I ordered SM (6-8), which is my size, and when I received them they fit perfectly.  But when I received the second pair, same size SM, I could not even get them up over my thighs.  So have sent back and ordered Med, which I am hoping are not too big.  Sizes extremely inconsistent, but love the pants.  Unfortunately will not know which size to order in future."
3.0,Well made...I wish it was just 6 inches longer
3.0,The front of the suit is absolutely adorable!!!! But the back is yellow and see thru :-(  we will be using this in the home pool only ... she loves the design though!!!
3.0,My girlfriend LOVES the style of this necklace. I am giving a three star review because I keep having to fix the necklace that keeps breaking. I am going to take it to a jewlers later and have a good quality necklace put on it instead of the cheap one attached.
3.0,"Cheap wig, hard to brush into complaince. Ended up not using it, waste of money. Although I should have expected that for the inexpensive cost of this item"
3.0,Exactly what it looks like.  Perfect for a giveaway as a favor for a bridal shower.  Priced affordably.  Only issue we ran into is the fact that the product did not arrive on time and we were not able to return.
3.0,"It wasn't as slouchy as I was expecting, and the item I received was not the magenta color pictured. Luckily, I also liked the bright pink color. Just know that there is no purple in the color. The plus side is, it kept me very warm‚Äã during fall in Vermont."
3.0,Went off of the size chart but it was too large and baggy. The slit up the side is very high and when you sit down expect for everything to be shown.
3.0,"I have a large head, and despite that, I hoped these would fit. They didn't. To understand how small these are for me, cut off the sleeve from an adult small t-shirt and try to put it on the head of a 200 lb adult man. It's going to be tight and uncomfortable, if he can get it over his head at all. That is how these fit me.<br /><br />Its unfortunate. Quality-wise, aside from them being obnoxiously small, they're not of a bad quality, the fabric feels nice.<br /><br />To everyone else: good luck."
3.0,"I'm only giving these a 3 because of a couple of issues.<br />I reallt like the style, and other than being a bit snug, they fit ok. I'm technically a 34 but always order 36 to compensate for conceal carry. I ordered these in 36, so buyer beware that these fit slightly smaller than size ordered. If you like them snug, go one size up. If you like them loose, go 2 sizes up.<br />Noe on to the zipper. The best way I van describe it, is...  the zipper is really janky and sticky. Very dissatisfied in this area because I really think the overall material of the shorts are good and I like the style.<br />I solve the zipper problem by using a little lip balm or graphite from a pencil lead, but it has to be reapplied after washing. I'm hoping after several applications of a lubricant, washing and some breaking in, the zipper will be smoother. Only time will tell."
3.0,"These glasses are fine, but not high quality by any means. Great price point for adequate product."
3.0,"True to size but oddly, the teal blue color is nice but the lace is a peach color instead of cream or beige!"
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt my favorite.  Material wasn‚Äôt as good as other brands.
3.0,"I bought it to wear for my hikes as the full face shield gets too reflective. I could not wait for it to reach me. However, this thing is so big that wearing it by itself it won‚Äôt offer any protection. The cut on the cheeks comes all the way down to almost your lips, which is ridiculous. However, I made it work for extra protection, I am going to wear it over my mask. Wearing it over a mask also makes the shield prop up a bit. Which gives me peace of mind and helps me breathe better as now I don‚Äôt have to wear two masks and feel asphyxiated. I am also adding a bracket I der my mask, so the bracket, the mask, and this shield is my defense in this pandemic.<br /><br />However as I can‚Äôt use it for my hiking so I have to keep looking."
3.0,"Loved it, until the main section lining tore within 6 months.... good organizer, zippers work really well, outer purse still looks great. I use purses much longer than 6 months....  so am afraid to replace this one."
3.0,"Just not what I thought it was. Nothing wrong with the band, and certainly not for what it cost. I just didn‚Äôt care for it once I had it in front of me. All else was great."
3.0,I am not reviewing the shoes
3.0,"Bummer, needed 50, got 49..."
3.0,"This tank top was a bit too big. I ordered it in grey in a small but it is not tight on me and is actually a bit baggy which is weird because I'm usually a medium in tops. The design wraps around the front which makes it hard to see because of my breasts. It is very cute still and I do wear it often. Really like the open back and the short length. Wouldn't buy again, but won't return."
3.0,had it for a while now and never wear it as it gaps in the front pretty severely
3.0,I ordered a size 11 and it was way too small. Can these boots be ordered in a larger size
3.0,"Good quality, but the bunchy chest piece will not lay well. My husband made fun of it saying it looked like I was wearing a bib. I tried sewing it down in a few spots, but it bunches weird. It‚Äôs stiff cotton material"
3.0,They are very hard.
3.0,This was smaller than expected though I got my normal size.  It was very hard for me to get on and off.  I passed it on to a friend.
3.0,"Material was thin, and the red was rather orangey."
3.0,"The cord faded after a while, but it went through some harsh conditions. Simply take care of it, unlike I did, and it should last a rather long time."
3.0,"Is much easier to breathe in mask using this. Doesn't need up make up. But it also loosens mask so it's not a snug in face, which isn't good"
3.0,It looked great but was too big for my ear I couldn't wear it :(
3.0,I received the wrong color üò≠
3.0,"They are cute, but some came broken. With other cups that I had ordered."
3.0,"I have several La Blanca suits and returned this one because it fits waaaay smaller than the others.  Very short in the torso, which made the band detail under the bust line look stretched and janky.  Shame as I loved the design."
3.0,"Served the purpose and were good material, just kind of thin and had to tie closely to your face to prevent sliding"
3.0,"This was a good looking hat, but I sent it to my future son-in-law for Christmas and my daughter saw it first and said it was a women‚Äôs hat. He saw it and said it looked like a women‚Äôs hat. I ended up returning it."
3.0,I felt like this was a little too see through.  I love a mesh workout top but this was just too sheer for my liking.
3.0,They looked really nice but they were a little too tight bought extensions and they work fine and they gave me an extra 1 for being a customer
3.0,Comfortable but pilled after a few washings.  Very visible on a dark color.
3.0,Fit is pretty good and my 4yo can easily get them on and off himself which is the goal.  But we‚Äôve only worn them for a few weeks and the design is all scuffed and worn off.  So they dont look nice for very long.
3.0,These are okay. Everything I see is red. Red red red red red red red. Glad I only spent 5 bucks
3.0,It was nice just a little shorter than I would wear (I am 5'7&#34;). I ended up returning it.
3.0,A lot heavier material then I expected. They DO NOT breathe.
3.0,"I bought these for driving and boating, for which they worked well for. The Polarized does show the water's gleam and shimmer however you get a gap between your face and the glasses due to where the nose bridge sits. The nose bridge is non adjustable which is another minor issue, but for the price they work well. The issue I have is they are suppose to be harder and avoid scratches etc, but the first low drop out of my Jeep Wrangler (while parked not moving) they broke and scratched the lens. So I shall be looking else where for my next pair with stronger support and no gap."
3.0,"What quality leather means to people can vary a LOT. This strap is comfortable and the hardware is good. The quick release on the spring bar is very nice. But the leather, despite saying it is genuine, does not feel high quality. This will not patina nicely as it accumulates wear and scratches And absorbs oil. Leather scratches and smooths out and shines as it absorbs oil. It is a natural material. This doesn‚Äôt show signs of wear at all actually which is what makes it really not seem like real leather. It feels plasticy, though soft, but will probably last for a while if treated well. The color is good though so at least it looks good and is comfortable. If you want real nice leather you will probably have to pay more."
3.0,"It is ok, but I wouldn't buy it again.  The interior card slots are poorly made and hard to fit credit cards.  The clasp is magnetic but the hold is week, it often flops open.  I am considering  using my seam ripper and just taking it off.  I like the two compartments so I can just put my phone in one and money, lip gloss, gum, etc in the other."
3.0,"I like the style a lot because I need something that is stylish but *modes* because I am a teacher. However, this skirt is way longer than pictures and I am 5'9&#34;. Still, it is too long and I don;t like how it looks on me. The material is quite nice actually. I had to return it."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Cheap looking stones, lacking quality but good for costumes."
3.0,I wear my toe rings 24/7 and these fade to dingy within weeks. If you‚Äôre getting them for occasional finger rings it‚Äôs probably fine but as a ring to wear all the time they‚Äôre not ok. But I guess for the price I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
3.0,"I am 5'2"" a size 12/14 and this looks like a shapeless potato sack on me. I never learn my lesson and always order this style of dress which seems more suited for a thinner person. Lots of static cling as well. Soft material."
3.0,Great idea and product
3.0,It‚Äôs very thin!
3.0,"they're cute...but the tiger tooth earring wont stay on, expect to lose it the 1st time u wear it..and 1 or two of the earrings look really cheap...other than that, I got at least 3 really cute pieces out of the deal.."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:583d59e5f971f86bc3a6c09a119db427]] Es un collar cl√°sico con un toque elegante y diferente, ideal para las personas que les gusta tener accesorios √∫nicos y diferentes. Las piedras parecen ser reales, pero realmente no s√© si son aut√©nticas. Lo que me gusta de esta pieza es que tiene un corte largo, sostenido de una pieza en cuero y a√∫nque tiene piedras es un collar muy liviano."
3.0,"They seem to be well made, but ended up returning them. The rings are two different sizes. Not only 2 different gauges, but 2 different diameters. Didn't work for me as a result"
3.0,"Fit was stated as ""True to size"".  Ordered a large and was much smaller than my regular Large NordiTrack vest.  In the picture I turned the heated vest inside-out since it is white and you can see the contrast between it and my black non-heated NordiTrack vest which is also a Large.  It's like wearing a wetsuit as far as how snug it fits.  I guess being snug it keeps the warming pads closer to the body but a little looser would have been nice.<br />You can feel the heat pretty quickly after turning it on and it cools very quickly when turning it off.<br />The heat from the two front heaters is pretty good.  The two lower back heaters are okay.  The single upper middle back heater is just so-so.  I wish it had more upper back heating pads like some other vests.<br />I do like the fleece material and how light weight it is but on the fence about returning it due to size."
3.0,The fabric is more like a dress pant. I am 5‚Äù8‚Äù and they weren‚Äôt as fitted as far as length as I thought. Around the crouch looked weird to me but they were comfy .
3.0,Small as heck!
3.0,"These pajama pants are extremely soft and comfortable, however, they are too baggy for me. I am 5'2, 135lbs and a small fit me well on the waist, but the legs are humongous and not flattering at all. They were also too long. Beware if this is not what you are looking for!"
3.0,"it is too small for my husbands wrist, I think that if it is unisex it should be big enough for most people it isn't"
3.0,ADORABLE pic!  I love Boston Terriers.  It‚Äôs small though.  I gave it to my granddaughter as it pulls my ears forward.
3.0,I have a small head and this mask was quite tight and the face cutout is small.  The sizing seems more appropriate for a child.
3.0,"Not bad for the price. Way longer than I imagined. Definitely past the knees. I'm 5'6"" and a size small. Dont like that the color on the inside isn't the same as the outside."
3.0,"Fit well, pattern is bright and stretches without distortion.  Comfortable but are not as soft and breathable as other leggings I own.  The material has almost a fleece like texture on the inside making it unsuitable for wearing in the summer.  Cute, but wouldn't but these again."
3.0,"Small in the arms, fit ok everywhere else."
3.0,Very cute but the bow is much smaller then the picture
3.0,First one was bad.  Second was. Dry underwhelming
3.0,"This bra was too loose unless I did the x hook in the back. It's also very uncomfortable because the material for hooks and loops around the band is scratchy and pointy, not soft at all. I like the mesh sides and cups in the front, but overall too uncomfortable to be my go-to sports bra."
3.0,"these sandals seem adequate for the gym, which is why i purchased them, however they are rather stiff and probably not your lounging type of sandal. More importantly, for potential buyers with moderate to fairly wide feet, it should be noted that these flip flops are narrow. Due to their rigidity and stiffness of the plastic material of which they are constructed, there is no possibility for wearing them in or achieving expansion. They are narrow enough where going up a size will likely not work for you if you have significantly wide feet. In sum, they run narrow and thus i had to return 'em. Hope this helps...."
3.0,Quality is good; it‚Äôs just huge.
3.0,"It‚Äôs a pretty dress, fit as expected. You will need an underdress as it is see through."
3.0,I like the dress but it runs small. I ordered a 2X and I could barely get into it. Looks like a women‚Äôs size Large. That‚Äôs two sizes too small.
3.0,these are the perfect size which is always a concern when buying online. but as far as the &#34;flesh&#34; color its more of a barbie tone to light pink color.
3.0,Although this product is very cute when arrived the sizing was EXTREMELY small.
3.0,A little big in the waist and you have to keep pulling them up
3.0,"I love this shirt, but I was really disappointed in how short it is.  T-shirts weren't really meant to be a little loose AND super short.  I probably should've ordered a men's version.  Otherwise, good quality shirt."
3.0,"This tote is huge, absolutely huge. I ordered thinking it was like a medium slightly large tote but it is extra large. It‚Äôs bigger than a beach bag but it‚Äôs nice if you‚Äôre going out of town or need to take a lot of stuff with you but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you wanted it for an everyday purse, I‚Äôd recommend the medium one!"
3.0,"This shirt is cute, and I want to love it. But, the collar can be a little weird, it stands up a little awkwardly.  I think it also runs a little small, and it sits weird across the chest. The seam between the fuzzy and quilted sits right across the center of my chest. The length and sleeves are good, and it fits well everywhere else. Maybe a size up would have been better, but I'm afraid it would have been too big everywhere else."
3.0,the battery only lasted 2 days
3.0,I liked the cut and feel of this product but I was disappointed it was too small. I should have researched reviews and such.<br />Free returns are great!
3.0,"Travels well, but I have noticed after several washes that the collar looks a little frumpy. I suppose I could iron, but I bought the shirt so I would not have to iron."
3.0,"I ordered a small (I'm usually xs on Women's and small on Juniors). The top is big and loose around the shoulders. Odd because Asian sizes usually run small,expected it to fit just right. It is doable but just a tad bit scared it might fall off. The color blue and material is nice. Still thinking whether  to keep or gift it to a friend."
3.0,Box was opened and smashed but they fit and work nicely
3.0,"It's beautiful, but it's too big."
3.0,Design is super cute but the quality is horrible. I feel as though the fabric will cut my skin (not literally) but that bad.
3.0,Ran tight!
3.0,Ordered XXL probably a XXXL would have fit. I'm 6'5 230 pounds.
3.0,Thinner than I had expected.
3.0,"I have a few pairs of pasties but nothing that promises the lift that these do, so I was excited to try them. There are no instructions, so it was a bit difficult to figure out how to place them exactly and how they should be used. They are very sticky, but I touched the sticky part a bit while I was putting them on, and it got unsticky pretty fast. It‚Äôs nice that they‚Äôre washable, but I haven‚Äôt tried to wash them yet. I‚Äôd imagine you have to hand wash, or else they‚Äôd probably stick to the washer? What I‚Äôm really sad about is that there‚Äôs no real way to store them - I have some other similar ones that I just stick together (sticky sides in), but I fear that these will never separate again if I do that.  You also cannot use them with strapless things because the bunny-ear part will stick out. It is great that these come with an extra pair of pasties though, I use those pretty often."
3.0,"Beautiful product, but unfortunately I had to superglue the centerpiece to the necklace because it fell out as soon as I opened it."
3.0,Good quality but size was way to small and I even went up a size. So maybe go up 2 sizes?
3.0,The product arrived broken and some of the chains had dislodged from their proper place. Luckily my gf makes jewelry and was able to fix it no problem.
3.0,"Time and calendar on watch work well.  Disappointment:  The light doesn‚Äôt work properly, making it impossible to check for time when I want to, i.e. at night."
3.0,easy to put on; doesn't muss in suitcase!
3.0,"Dress runs a little larger, I am a small and bought a small but the dress was big on me. Also when I finally received my dress I was so excited but the dress was humid and smelled like mildew. Otherwise a very beautiful dress!"
3.0,"Cute dress, too small though!"
3.0,"It looks really sharp, but it feels like cheap plastic."
3.0,"Not an automatic watch needs wound by hand. The strap isnt 100% straight, but I would definitely buy another"
3.0,This bra is very cheaply made. The straps are way too thin for the large breast sizes it is available in. It also manages to be loose in the cups while still digging into the top of the breast leaving noticeable spillage. You get what you pay for so I guess I should have expected it not to be made well for the price.
3.0,Cute for short term use. A week was the longest would last.
3.0,I bought the largest size for my boyfriend and they didn't even fit. I wish they had more size options. And the material feels cheap
3.0,Weird fit in the heel
3.0,run pretty true to size except if you have wide feet.
3.0,The suit is ok.  The mask is not the best.  It looks like a little paper flimsy mask. I ended up having to get another head piece to go with the costume. But my kid likes the suit so I gave it 3 stars.
3.0,for the price i guess its good.. see-threw though.
3.0,This hat is a little small for the head of my 8 year old daughter; but it still fits.
3.0,Looks nice in the photos and a different feel in real life. No complaint.<br /><br />Could fill stones into the pendant.
3.0,"The jewelry is very cute - looks just like I wanted it to, but it is very small for a standard belly button piercing and BARELY fits.  Also, I know the description states that this is only gold plated, but I expected the jewelry to still be metal - not gold plated plastic.  When you plate plastic, it chips easily and pretty immediately, which is what happened just from screwing the plastic bead onto the bar.  I don't expect this particular piece of jewelry will hold up well or for very long, but it is still cute and I'll enjoy it for as long as it does last."
3.0,Love the item but they don't fit as you would expect. We ordered the exact size and it is a bit small. But they look cool!
3.0,"I really like these pajamas, but I do need to mention a unique feature about the fit. The are fuzzy and warm, but fit snug in the upper arm. I normally wear a small, but I know these can run small so I ordered a medium. They fit great, except for the upper arm (bi-cep). They are snug there and the material doesn‚Äôt stretch much."
3.0,Smells like finger nail polish. Not sure if it really does anything or not.
3.0,Way too hot for me otherwise great product.
3.0,Looks exactly like the picture except the tear drop is missing the blue stone
3.0,It is nice quality
3.0,"I love bug sunglasses, but these were too big. Still cute, but a little obnoxious."
3.0,"I am 5'5'', and the dress barely covers my butt. I will not be able to wear it as a dress, so I am pretty disappointed. It will look cute tucked into a skirt as a top, though."
3.0,At the point where it cris crosses on the sides.. it was a larger there. My daughter had extra fabric at her waistline. It was strange. Like i needed to take it in so people couldn't see the open space that shows through the side opening to the other side of the opening on the other side. Just not a slim fit all the way down. Strangely larger at the waistline.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7a1522cfbeb75c1cd3d332559525bb03]] Bought for a work related contest. Worked fine. Won second place. Mask is noticibly brighter on one side. Something, maybe the battery, is sewn into the mask right in front of the mouth. It is bright enough to be seen in every thing except maybe direct sun."
3.0,"Good Value , there was a chemical smell on it, aired it out  useful ."
3.0,The sizing is all off.
3.0,my daughter is extremely petite and i would say she's like a 00 in jeans and this xs was still to bog on her but it is a beautiful dress. It's heavy and the material DOES NOT look cheap
3.0,arms are long
3.0,I really like the look of this that this is my second one but I probably won't buy another. Both have had their back strap break after about 5-6 months of use.
3.0,Not exactly what I was hoping for but for the price it will do. Would have bought it if I saw it first.
3.0,Sleeve to big
3.0,Not a conventional shirt<br />Jumper style<br />certainly shouldn't be a slim fit<br />Colors are fantastic
3.0,"It's a good hat. Looks good. It's bowl is just a little too deep and the mesh rubs on the top of my ears. So in result it's slightly uncomfortable. There is a gap between the front of the hat and my forehead so the fabric behind the logo has obvious signs of open space and makes it look a little funky. I'm an average sized guy. So if you have a small head, don't buy this hat. Other than that though, it's a great hat. Idk if I'll buy another though."
3.0,"This dress was high quality and the design was nice, but the sizing is off.  I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 125 lbs. - I always wear a size 'S' dress.  The bandeau portion at the top was extremely, uncomfortably tight - I have a small ribcage and it was far too tight on me.  It was quite long as well (at my height I'm right between regular and petite sizing) so I would have had it taken up.  I would order a size up and plan to get it hemmed."
3.0,Didn't fit as expected. Returned and purchased a similar one different brand. Not sure if this boot was meant to be sold as a wide.
3.0,Eh too cheap looking
3.0,"This belt works fairly well. Just enough stretch to make it comfortable and the slim width works with all my pants. There are a few downsides though. First the buckle is made of cheap plastic that, with the design of the clasps, seems to be just begging to be broken. The black belt material also looks cheap, even for casual wear. Perhaps some of the patterns might be better. There's no way I'd wear this belt in an office or work setting. Finally, as other reviewers have noted, it's very difficult to adjust. The downsides wouldn't be a big deal to me, except for the price. The overall quality just doesn't seem up to the almost $30 price tag."
3.0,"One of the gems was already out if place, not the best quality but cute"
3.0,The material is great and I love the pockets! However I can pull it over my head without a problem. The sleeves are definitely too baggy . Not a good look for a wedding. I'll be returning for another size and I may get it in black instead. I do live the style but not the fit.
3.0,"On one of the masks, one side is a little longer than the other side.  Should be a perfect match when the seam is in the center."
3.0,The stones on this set are AMAZING. Sparkle better than a diamond. the metal itself looks cheap and overly shiny. The main stone is what makes it look fake because it's much too big.I can say that it is true to size and very comfortable to wear besides the main stone getting caught on things. Super fast shipping I would order again if they had another style I liked. Recommend if you have a flashier style
3.0,very wide band - had to modify for some watches
3.0,I sent these back.  They were too big.
3.0,"I love this cardigan and have purchased 2 already.  I have an olive green and turquoise which are great.  They are lightweight, easy for travel and can pack in my purse.  However, I ordered the coral and I think it is more hot pink then coral, therefore I will be returning this one."
3.0,It is small for a standard challenge coin
3.0,Fabric is very light weight. But that can have its advantages in the south
3.0,"I loved the fabric, but is too small the bottom. Top fits of but is hard to pull the pants, looks like I'm dancing to makenit go up üôÑ"
3.0,"Nah eye shield pulls out not flat looked weird , unless u have a forehead that follows it lol ill pass"
3.0,"Cute, way to big"
3.0,def order down im 180 and i ordered a Large and it was way too big and too long<br />material was a little strange and way too wide
3.0,Fabric has a nice stretch to it
3.0,love everything about the jacket except that it stains too easily.  i walk my dog twice daily and something always gets it dirty.....ugh....
3.0,"Cute dress and was looking forward to it, but the size chart is misleading. I am only 5'2&#34; and 115 lb with narrow build. With 37&#34; bust and 34&#34;hips size chart put me as Large. I ordered Medium anyway since it says there's spandex and I almost never wear L even in Asian sizes. Medium not only fit but was too loose and unflattering. My size is most likely a Small for sure but at this time returning it."
3.0,Much larger than it appears.
3.0,It's fit but the skirt was too short
3.0,"Material is cheap,see threw to be exact"
3.0,"After reading the reviews I decided to get an XL but should‚Äôve ordered my regular size for bottoms, a large. Returning anyways because it was poor quality and a weird fit. Straps don‚Äôt fit like the picture shows. Cups in the top move around a lot."
3.0,"I was not expecting this to be as large as it was, so depending on what you are looking for that could be a pro or con.  The colors were not very vibrant, they are all very light.  Not what I expected, but on the plus side, the beads are sparkly and I hung it from my rear view mirror so I can see the sparkles which would be hard to see if wearing as a necklace."
3.0,"This was a very cute concept for an Ugly Sweater for my nephew. I ordered a SMALL and it was very snug on him. Was disappointed it ran small, but he had to make do with it. Probably end up being a one time use sweater."
3.0,"I like these, but the insides of some of them are all strings and unfinished, have pulled threads on the outside and some are perfect. Used three pair as gifts, the girls loved them. Will keep the others for myself and wear them around the hose. The price was a factor, next time I''ll spend a bit more!!"
3.0,It‚Äôs an okay suit. I‚Äôm not comfortable these days in swim wear and this works. I‚Äôm pretty short but the length of the suit seems a tad bit shorter than normal. I like that I feel fully covered and yet it‚Äôs not a completely old lady look.
3.0,Product came on time as described. However do feel small for my head and logo's after a few days have already started to come off. Maybe just the one in bunch?
3.0,The holes are really small for toys. I got a refund because I couldn't find any toys to go with the item.
3.0,"very beautiful, but it takes too long to arrive"
3.0,I liked the quality of the beanie
3.0,"Luckily, I have a small head but this is definitely more for younger girls. Only had it for about a week and the puff ball came off. Easy enough to attach it again. Just don't enjoy having to fix something so quick to purchasing it."
3.0,This is a pretty ring but it is far smaller than made to look in the pictures. This seems to be a theme with jewelry sold on Amazon.
3.0,Ok this band is very nice  the only thing is I had to wiggle the little metal piece in so it can lock in place  but for the price its no big deal  band still looks good.
3.0,It's ok soft but little hard to get on with my fro
3.0,"This was a very pretty dress and the material was super light but it didnt fit. I ordered an XL to fit my chest, but it was ginormous! Would probably need to wear a slip underneath as well."
3.0,"I am a size 36 and the Large runs loose. I would suggest ordering a size down.  If the size chart was correct, I would give 5 stars."
3.0,The dress has the potential to be pretty but it was hole wasn‚Äôt made for the belt to go threw üòØ
3.0,My daughter loved this watch but it broke after she got it a little wet. It's supposed to be water resistant.
3.0,The headpiece size didnt match the body piece.  Headpiece was more older child to adult size way too big for infant head.  The body piece is fine for newborn but no where near 3 months or larger as advertised.  Otherwise very cute piece.
3.0,Workmanship terrible.
3.0,I was disappointed in fabric. Very shiny n polyester look n feel. The wide elastic under bodice made it look like made in 7the grade homeck class. Tho I love the cut of then hemline. Will look for that in other garments.
3.0,Would like bigger sizes.The Large fits like a small
3.0,Foot part fit but the top of boot is very small.
3.0,Nothing is wrong with this so much as it‚Äôs just cheap looking and not the most flattering. Idk why I got this it‚Äôs just kind of ugly.
3.0,"I ordered this dress in medium size with a grey/blue color, when the dress arrived, it was way too big. I looked like a 12 year old trying to wear my mother's clothes. I sent it back and exchanged for a small, which fit much better. (I'm 5'4, 145- not fluffy, I do crossfit.) I really loved the way this dress looked on the model, and I was excited to wear it out, but I have a short waist and it ended up looking frumpy on me. It didn't drape well and gave me no waist, I'm not a skinny girl, but it hung off me like a scarecrow. I pinned the back to give it a more &#34;fitted&#34; look without being tight, and I like it, I'll probably take it in for alterations, maybe some darts on the sides. The color is gorgeous and I like the idea of the dress, but the slouchy style just didn't suit me. The first two photos are the dress as is, in front view and profile. The last one shows it &#34;pinned&#34; in the back."
3.0,Order a size up. Small and sleeve seams lay weird
3.0,Its an alright product but loses its elasticity over time and fades. This was after 2 washes.
3.0,"I bought a brown one and a black one. The brown one came in a gift box & bag, the black one did not. I intended to use the black as a gift, so I had to repackage this black one in the brown watch's box. Seller said they changed the packaging. So beware if you are planning to use it as a present! Otherwise, beautiful watch at a great price (I see that it is even cheaper now)."
3.0,They look good but after a couple of times wearing them they look like we have had them for years. Not a big fan of their quality. They fit perfectly though
3.0,Really nice but gets twisted easily. Also the gold color faded off after only about 2 uses...now it just looks like dirty metal.
3.0,If your looking for compression leggings keep looking.
3.0,I like the size of the purse and the pockets it has. The lining could be heavier. The middle zipper pocket is week and droops down so far you could lay at the bottom of the purse. There is no name on the purse inside or out.
3.0,Way too expensive for plastic earrings. My niece loved them.
3.0,"not for everyday use but if you must, make sure to glue the rubbers onto the plastic because they fall out really easy. also don't screw them on to tight as it causes it to crack."
3.0,"I am a little disappointed because I love the style of this shirt. it's so creative and interesting. The problem for me is the sizing, and maybe it would work better for someone more petite. I am 5'10"" and have a larger chest FYI.<br /><br />At first I ordered a Large and it was way too small. The next one was an XL, and now it fits fine, but is a little bit short. It's also made out of the type of material that is not very flattering at all. You can see my belly button outline through it which I hate. It's also just a little bit too wide. I can understand why the model has it tucked into her pants,"
3.0,I love that I can now make double sided keychains but I'm upset because a lot of the glass comes were broken.
3.0,Much thicker than I was expecting.  To thick for a medal.  Perfect to wear alone.
3.0,Strange. I‚Äôve been buying these same shirts for years. This last order the black looks faded (which is why I buy new shirts - I wear these with my scrubs for work).
3.0,Son searched for Nike elite socks &amp; these elite socks came up. He was disappointed that they were not Nike but didn‚Äôt state in discrimination. Returning.
3.0,"Very cute billy had a hole in the side of the dress so, I reordered one and that one had a hole too!"
3.0,"I love the way this necklace looks, but the clasp broke the 3rd time I wore it."
3.0,Infected my Ears
3.0,I was not satisfied with the fit and weight of the wool.  Bit skimpy fit and not
3.0,Only came with 2 shirts
3.0,"Good for what I payed, wife wore them once so far."
3.0,Tarnished after a few wears but the watch remained in good condition
3.0,"my kid is adorable in anything but the goggles are a little cheap and not representative of what they show in the picture. In fact I don't even think this picture remotely looks like the cap we got, but its still cute."
3.0,Very yellow  cute but cheaply made  get what u pay for
3.0,Shorter than I thought too big at the top so sorry. All the fist three items will be sent back I can‚Äôt print out shipping info from phone it‚Äôs all I have how can I ship back?
3.0,bright flouresent straps make it easy to spot your bag at a distance on the belt in the airport.  however the straps are not very easy to tighten down on the bag.  guess they were pretty cheap and you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Using to hold shirt in when umpiring behind the plate.  Seem to loose grip after a few uses and one came apart where it is adjusted.  Bought to sets, based on price.  They work but questionable durability.  Stay tuned."
3.0,Size runs too large.
3.0,I really love the charm but the chain is a bit too fragile
3.0,They are pretty but it's like one minute they are too tight and the next they are loose. The charms also keep turning to the side they never stay in the right position which I don't even know how that works. However overall they are just pretty.
3.0,It‚Äôs just ‚Äúokay‚Äù. It fits a little baggier then I would of liked and it‚Äôs not very long in the torsoe.
3.0,"I ordered 2 pairs of compression stockings for my daughter for Christmas. Same size, same company, different patterns (the others were the black with pink ribbons). She loved both but after wearing one time, one of the stockings falls down. They had been hand washed and hung to dry. Would have been 5 stars if not for this problem. My daughter is a nurse and it sort of defeats the purpose of wearing them."
3.0,Small. Does not fit much
3.0,Love the boots but not even a wk after having them the flowers started to come off but they are adorable!
3.0,Its looks really nice..but only can get at maximum of 6 wears from this watch...
3.0,"They fit fine, but I wish they were a bit longer."
3.0,Asked for a 6... I read size 6 on the pakaging... the ring was a size 7
3.0,These glasses break too easily.
3.0,"I LOVED the dress however it didn't fit in the chest.  I am 5'2"" and a 36D, couldn't zip up the side.  Was sad to return."
3.0,"I am not satisfied with this product. I know each is different, but, mine looks so artificial, the color looks weird, the shape is so boxy; it looks ‚Äúfake‚Äù.<br />I bought the rainbow stone because it had gotten good reviews. Well, regrettably, not from me."
3.0,The cuffs don‚Äôt fit on my ears they‚Äôre way too small and I‚Äôve worn plenty of other cuffs before.  Everything else is pretty and nice quality though.
3.0,a few of the rivets on the holes have already come off
3.0,Beautiful earrings. The post is very thin and bent the second time I put them in. Hoping they do not break. The Crystal is stunning
3.0,Good but did not fit could not get it to fit
3.0,Hat was too big for my head- could not secure the Velcro.
3.0,Pajamas appeared to have been opened before I received it...zip seal broken and looks as if they were jammed in the package as they're very wrinkled. Fabric is nice and I like the style...it's a shame they run small.
3.0,"Not as vibrant in real life, but works"
3.0,Arrived in a protective bag which is a plus.  But these earrings look cheap.
3.0,They were size 9 when i purchased it and were too big so i kept one and washed it normally and now it is a size 8.and still alittle too big.There is no way these are the correct material that is stated or they wouldnt shrink a  full size. Disppointed.
3.0,"These were straight up plastic, very fragile, and they were purple. I'm not sure if they sent me the wrong version, but they were also very tiny.  Will not work for an average sized man."
3.0,The fabric is very slim and things can kind of be seen through them a bit.
3.0,They are fun but not very flattering and they are stiff (I hope I don't break them soon).<br /><br />I think they are a little bit big but this could be just because my face is not very round. They look better with the hair down.
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, and the corseting in the back allows room for shaping, but the peacock application was unraveling and coming off the dress when I took it out of the package."
3.0,"I thought the shoes were perfect but apparently the size runs a little small. My daughter wore them to a family luncheon and not even an hour later complained her feet hurt. The style is great because she loved them enough to attempt to wear them to the event, but I suppose the pain ended up unbearable. I only returned due to the size. A larger size was not available, however, this is a great shoe in all."
3.0,"I have a lot of these stretchy skater dresses. Most of them fit snug, but comfortably. This one is not one of them. I wear a size 8, and this fits like it's made for a child. I hope my 8 year old daughter wants it."
3.0,"Not quite as expected.  I had a similar type of sleeve in the past, with a gel pad.  The compression sleeve fits fine, and the series of small pads -vs one gel pad - are okay.  For the price, and the limited expected use, it was a good deal.  Cleaning is a bit of a chore, and the pads didn't stay put past three wearings.  It meets my needs.  I was surprised how long it was."
3.0,The hearts broke off of bottom of the chains after 33 days so can't return or wear but is pretty
3.0,Looks so fake
3.0,"Three stars because I'm split on my review.  I'm 5'6&#34; and about 135 pounds.  But I usually buy separates because I need a smaller size on top than bottom after having kids:).  I ordered the large and the bottoms fit perfectly and I love them.  The top, even though it tied in the back, was way too big.  I'm about a c cup and the cups in this top were practically under my arms when I tied it as tight as I needed it, so definitely not something I could wear.  Ideally, these should be sold as separates - I would have paid the price for just the bottoms:)."
3.0,"I ordered the all-gray set. When I tried a pair on, I saw that the generally light gray color had unsightly streaks of a darker gray running up and down on them. Still, I do think they'll serve their basic function as compact gloves that can be used when cold weather calls for them..."
3.0,They fit great the stretches great they do enhance your look.  I love him to death but....  be careful when you wash them I'm not for sure if I should wash them inside out or not if that would've made a difference but washing them cause the effect of what sweatershirts and sweatpants do after you washed and dry them they cause little fabric balls all over you can take a shaving razor and remove as many little fabric balls as possible but there is quite a bit I wasn't expecting that to happen with these jeans but they did I'm upset because now they kind of don't look the greatest with all the fix balls but I love them the way they fit.did cause me to avoid purchasing more pairs
3.0,La piedra muy bonita excelente pero la cadena no dur√≥ mucho en cambiar de color
3.0,"This bra is really great quality and has a thick strap in the back, but it‚Äôs definitely not a minimizer. There is no padding but a lot of underwire. I ordered my typical size 34F/34DDD and it fits tightly like I would likely need to go up a cup size and gives me a lot of cleavage like a push-up bra. The lace is nice but would not recommend this as a minimizing bra at all."
3.0,Looks just like I thought it would.
3.0,Fit somewhat bigl but it had a tear on the sleeve
3.0,Won't stay in ears
3.0,"Anyway I got these boots to replace my aging combat boots that I normally wore for motorcycle riding. As a story here, I was riding a Japanese bike with all my friends that rode Harleys. When we got to Sturgis they mentioned that I had enough class to have Harley boots. As I was taking my boots off I noticed the inside of the tongue said made in China. I showed that to my friends that were uh, sorta closed mouthed about the deal.<br /><br />They are high and tight boots and provide a lot of protection and grip. The extra strap does keep them locked down on your foot to be sure. My biggest complaint is that they are stiff as a bone. They don't work so well for clumping around after a long bike ride. Maybe it just take years to break them in."
3.0,"Bracelet was beautiful, it was given as a birthday gift. However after only 3 months, it's fallen apart. Custom service was kind enough to offer a replacement. I appreciate a company that stands behind their product."
3.0,It was much larger than expected and hollow on the backside.  Not what I expected.
3.0,This is a cute dress but it is a little large on me.  I normally wear a Medium in dresses but I ordered a small and it fits more like an XL.  I could have worn a XXS.  I had it taken in on the sides a little and now it fit better.
3.0,A little small and too short. Not what I expected.
3.0,"Really cut dress but too high waisted for a short gal like me. Plus it hung at my knees, too long for me. Too bad cause it is a cute dress:)"
3.0,Way smaller than advertising stated.
3.0,Exactly as advertised but not a fan of boxers made of tee shirt material. They tend to ride up or down on me for no apparent reason.  Will buy the woven boxers next of which i own a couple pairs. I just didn't know which was which when I bought these.
3.0,I like the silk. The shorts are very nice but the shirt is so so small it barely covers my chest
3.0,I ordered these leggings hoping for comfort. They are very small for what I expected. There was not as much stretch as I had hoped for.
3.0,"Nice glasses, but sent wrong color. Tried to contact, but no reply??????"
3.0,they are mostly for young children. but we'll make them work
3.0,These are really cute but the backs pop off easily
3.0,"This is a good hat, just a little deep, so it sits low on my noodle. Made extremely well and shipped in a timely manner."
3.0,"Breaks a bit easy, but easy to fix."
3.0,it didn't come up too tall
3.0,"Material prohibits lamination. Material curls around edges if not framed. Still, I love seeing that ""Dream Team!"""
3.0,Its not fitted at top like the image suggests  and the weight of the material makes it just hang there. But the sequins are auper sparkly so it almost outweights the rest.
3.0,The color wasn‚Äôt quite what I expected.
3.0,"I ordered two sizes, one in Large and one in Xl. I received the XL first and the shirt was fine but the pants felt like a medium. They were very tight and see though. If you are ordering make sure to order a size up."
3.0,This is a fair item for your wardrobe.  the material feels a bit odd so I'm going to wash them and see if that makes it softer.  The length was too long but I am only 5'.  The pockets are good for putting things in.  I am a size 24 and ordered accordingly but the fit is a little tight.
3.0,"My husband & purchased this set for our trip to Thailand because of the TSA locks & easy to spot color. We received our purchase in a timely manner. Locks were easy to set up. We packed (30 lbs in the large bag 20 lbs in the medium & less than 10 lbs in the carry on) and once we went to load the bags into our car on the large suit case, at 30 lbs, the handle on top broke at the metal connecter.  Other than that all 3 suit cases held up & were easy to maneuver. Had no issues with the extendable handles or rollers & even though we came back with considerably more than what we left with (max travel weight in each bag of 50lbs) had no other issues with them. If it weren't for the handle breaking before even getting in the car I'd highly recommend these bags."
3.0,"You can see through the yellow one but size is a true 6/7. The top comes down too low, way too low(shows chest area) so be prepared to adjust the straps. A couple quick stitches or just use a back strap clip. Easy and worth it for sure. Great fabric too, light and airy."
3.0,Designed for tall person.  My short frame made me look huge. Not bad for the price and i liked the color
3.0,"This shirt is a dull, cloudy blue. We thought it would go well with my husband‚Äôs jeans, but it does not. He is 6‚Äô 1‚Äù and weighs 214."
3.0,"Really cute, exactly like the picture. I'd give it 3 stars because they're very tight to your head. I have a tiny head and they seem to squeeze my face, I ordered another pair but am keeping these because they are prettt cute."
3.0,"The outfit was super cute! But the colors faded with the first wash, and yes, I used cold water only and tumbled dry on low."
3.0,"Nice, too small for my nipple; or wrong size for it."
3.0,The dress is shorter than it appears from the picture. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and it comes above my knees. Other than the length it‚Äôs a nice dress.
3.0,I was excited about the product because it had so many pockets. As soon as I opened it I knew it was not going to fit but fingers crossed I tried anyway. As expected it was too big
3.0,"These boots are great for style purposes but they do not last long if you put them under heavy use.<br />Wore them every day to my job at a metal press shop, ten hour days 40 to 70 hours a week,<br />which is admittedly very heavy duty wear, but the boots did not last more than 3 months.<br />The soles wore down flat very quickly, and the seams tore open into holes by the end of the second month,<br />the surface on the left shoes toe wore off within the first week while the other held on for some reason.<br />They fall apart very quickly under Heavy regular use,<br />For purely fashionable use i am sure they will work perfectly fine, but will not work as an everyday wear.<br />Especially if you are a large heavy dude, which im sure contributed to the erosion and rupture over time."
3.0,Totally different as expected and small
3.0,Nice watch but there aren't any directions and I need to know how to set the date. The 3 knobs control time and the compass. Not sure how to set the date. Please contact me and I'll update the review
3.0,"Alright. Not terrible, and very pretty. However the fabric sucks in (more than other masks do) when you breathe through your nose or mouth making it difficult to breathe. Don't wear if you'll be walking or doing physical activity. Fine if you're sitting around. Gets hot."
3.0,"If I hadn't seen the pearl and gold bead version, this would have been ok. It seems fragile for children, however."
3.0,Slips down the heel during exercise.
3.0,"it's cute but elephant came off with in the first 10 min., but i put it back on"
3.0,"THese socks seem to be good quality, but they are not comfortable.  Very disappointing since I bout 4 pairs."
3.0,"I Never write reviews, but the stitching on this hat is just plain bad. The ""Q"" is very sloppy. I would send it back, but wanted a stylish hat to use at an amusement park trip in the next week..not enough time to do an exchange. Otherwise, its a decent ""dad"" hat and works for my purpose at the price point."
3.0,These sleep shirts are not true to fit. They run way small. They are soft.
3.0,"This dress was a little too tight on my boobs. The pattern appeared stretched out. I was unable to put the belt at my waist because the seam was pulled to right under my boobs. The dress was also tight around my hips and thighs, but not in a totally unflattering way.<br /><br />The fabric is thin enough for summer but didn‚Äôt seem sheer. It feels kind of cheap, but still comfortable."
3.0,Not very sturdy.  My nose pad came bent.
3.0,SUPER CUTE ! Does help keep dry in light mist like rain this is very thin material super light weight
3.0,"The sizes differ depending on the colors. I got a 3 pack: the white fit well and the material was nicely slick, the blue one felt stretched out after one wearing, and the gray one fit in the chest but the torso was about 3 inches too short, so I could barely tuck it in.  Not happy with the value and inconsistent sizing."
3.0,"My daughter was super excited about receiving this shoe only to become disappointed that it was too small. I recommend getting a size up. I ordered an 8, because she loved it so much I'll be giving that one away and ordering again in a 9."
3.0,The sizes run a bit small but other then that it‚Äôs not that bad considering the price but under armor is worth the price
3.0,Nice hat but it only fits a very tiny head. Should say &#34;infant&#34; not &#34;infant and toddler&#34;
3.0,After only having this for a few days the tassel fell off.
3.0,"Fits snug, size up!"
3.0,"I love this bracelet. It‚Äôs stones are really good quality and the bracelet felt like it was good quality. But after just a week of wearing it, the elastic string began to fray. I can‚Äôt contact the seller directly but I‚Äôm sure they would make good on the purchase in some way. Still worth the $10 you pay for it."
3.0,this is cute--however this is a just fit for me. i am normally an xl  --in general will go up a size in non american clothing since i have large boobs to make sure the item will fit.  this is a touch tight around the chest and arm area
3.0,"The shirt itself is nice, but the mesh is too loose around the arms, shoulders, back, and chest. It doesn't cling to my body and the waist is too wide, it's more of a medium! The shirt sort of just hangs off my shoulders. I wish it was more fitting. I am 5'4, 110 lbs, and small framed. I thought a small would fit me, but it fit like a medium, a very wide medium. There wasn't an extra small at the time. I don't blame the seller. I blame the people asking for larger sizes. A small should fit like a small! Stores cater towards larger/taller women in America. People, please don't change the asian sizes! It's difficult finding petite/shorter clothing in CA as is. Asian sizes are really the only sizes that fit me. Ah, so sad. Well, now I know to get an XS. Anyways, if you are a skinny/ smaller framed person like me, get an XS! Trust."
3.0,I like the fact that there aviator glasses and Bluetooth . but I don't like about them is when I put them on my face and where a hat ther too tight for my face and I think the lenses should be replaceable
3.0,Ordered same size (in my case a Small) and the sizes were different.<br /><br />I ordered black and khaki in the same size. Both labels say small but the khaki shorts are bigger in size as shown in the picture.
3.0,ear piece broke off after duress......and wont go back on!
3.0,These are a great value and are super cute/fashionable but they do not fit my adult head. They fit my 8 year old daughter perfectly.
3.0,"It's really cute and very durble but as others had mentioned very tight. I had tiny wrists so thought it wouldn't be a problem, but it cut off circulation. Very tight."
3.0,"I bought this product to wake me up, and it does that very well.  It has made my mornings far more productive and makes oversleeping impossible.  I've had a lot of issues with the Bluetooth connection.  I have followed all troubleshooting steps, but it often takes several tries and at least one hard reset to connect the device and it never stays connected for more than a few minutes.  This limits my access to features other than the alarm function.  I dont have this issue with any other Bluetooth device..  I wish I could explore some of the other functions, but it works splendidly to get me out of bed."
3.0,You get what you pay for but this sad even too cheap feeling for a planned costume.
3.0,Not as cute as I had expected though these things are all a matter of personal preference. Fabric is light weight and perfect for summer in the South. Mine ran a bit large.
3.0,"Loved the cut and the color, but not the material. I ended up returning it for a full refund."
3.0,Battery was just about dead when it was received. $8. at the jeweler‚Äôs and I‚Äôve got a great watch.
3.0,"It looks like cheap cufflinks ,,"
3.0,The texture of this fabric is like sandpaper
3.0,Beautiful bra but the band runs smaller than other bra bands the same size
3.0,I liked everything about the bracelet except the size. It looks really small. It is for a 50yr old as per the bday charm and I doubt it would fit many 50 yr olds.
3.0,"Material was not what was expected - shiny plastic like - fit was good, and it's ok for a house dress"
3.0,"Finding non latex nitrile gloves in size XS is difficult, these actually are even smaller and fit extremely tight."
3.0,"The watch is really cute but for the price, I was expecting  better quality.  The watch band is a very stiff leather. The crystal is a bit dull.  I'm not sure if I will keep the watch or not."
3.0,We have this brand of shirt. For some reason off Amazon it was much bigger than the other ones
3.0,The material in the picture looks like a sweater material. I think it was cotton. It was much longer and not as cute. It wasn‚Äôt bad just not what I expected
3.0,"The shirt was cute, but I had to return because it was too small.  I bought larger than I would normally wear, and this was too still too small.  I don't like anything fitted.  The return process was easy."
3.0,Runs very very small. Made well and seems very durable.
3.0,This blouse is not white it is off white. That was the disappointing fact.
3.0,"Shirts are about what's to be expected for the price, they're a little bit smaller than expected."
3.0,"So the shorts aren‚Äôt bad. They‚Äôre pretty comfortable. My beef is I had some change in my pocket & I was walking & POOF out it comes all over the place. Kind of embarrassing to say the least. It was my 1st time wearing the shorts too, so it‚Äôs not like I had something in there that could‚Äôve ripped the pocket"
3.0,"I received this pin the other day and was disappointed.  When I opened the box I saw a very sparkly pin with one of the red stones missing.  I will, surely, be sending it back for that, but I won't be having them send me a replacement.  I feel the pin is just too small for all that is going on.  Up close, it's pretty and sparkly, just as it is in the picture, but when I put it on and looked in the mirror, from that distance, I couldn't tell what it was.  It says that the diameter is approximately 1 3/4&#34;.  It's actually 1 1/2&#34; wide x 2&#34; long.<br /><br />I ordered another pin from Amazon, a green Christmas tree from Ever Faith which I think is just Beautiful."
3.0,As a 6ft tall woman I was expecting these to be higher then they are. They only go up mid calf but are very warm and sturdy. I won't be buying another pair as I was looking for a taller sock.
3.0,"Comfy but short. I'm 5'7"" and they're just around my ankles, a little of the high-water action happening, but okay for lounging around the house. Would not wear these out because of the length, would probably be okay if I were a couple inches shorter. Went for large size than I normally wear too. If they're made in China they things AWLAYS run small. A large will never be the equivalent of a US large."
3.0,"I love the color and the bottoms, but the top was waaay too small length-wise. Around the back it was perfect but it needed to be like 2 inches longer for me to be able to wear it without serious underboob or fear of falling out of it. I'd return it for a larger size, but then the bottoms would be way too big and the top would be too loose. Just be cautious if you have a large cup size like I do (34 DDD)"
3.0,Decent (but heavy) sunglasses. These sunglasses are plastic even though seller clearly claims they are metal. Points given for stylish looks. A little expensive considering they are made totally from plastic.
3.0,"So I feel overall the dress was nice stretch ,color and comfortable. I believe the spaghetti string of the dress can be a better material and my dress came ripped by the chest area . I put pictures to show . I was shocked this never happened to me and the things I bought . But I have to go out in two days so I don‚Äôt have time to get another dress ."
3.0,They are difficult to put in ears
3.0,this type of pant has the elastic waist band that can flip turn and twist with in the fabric making it bunchy around your waist. :/
3.0,"They are good material and serve the purpose till they don‚Äôt start coming out of the foot. The grip is loose at the back and it falls out multiple times and has to be reworn, else it gets too uncomfortable. I am not sure if I bought a size less or this is how the product is."
3.0,"Nice material, just too small"
3.0,"Very clever idea- and so cute! You can match your hair tie to your outfit and put it in the bracelet to make it a fashion statement- so cute! I am not sure if it's because I have small wrists but if there is no hair tie on the bracelet, it does not stay on, it slides off my wrist through the opening. I've almost lost the bracelet several times. And the hair tie does not stay on 100%, it can be easily slid off if you rub against something.<br />Super cute and I love the idea but I kind of wish the bracelet were a little bendy so the opening could be made smaller. That way even if the hair tie slides off, the bracelet will still stay on."
3.0,Really pretty necklace but it came broken. I was able to take some pliers and reattach.
3.0,"Just, OK. I hate padding in sports bras so I removed them but w/o it‚Äôs pretty thin. Some support but not a lot."
3.0,They we're beautiful andbibloved them but when I looked at size chart online it digested I buy a small for my waist line measurement and they were so small it hurts to wear them. Of course it didn't notice this till I washed them.
3.0,"Not the greatest quality, but nice bag."
3.0,Pretty color but waaaay too long for me (I'm 5'4&#34;) and too much fabric. It felt awkward on. I gave it away.
3.0,"This belt is very very very sturdy. It functions as a belt and bottle opener. When it's singed down around your waist there can be a panic to undo if you have to pee really bad so keep that in mind. It's some times a struggle to undo.<br />As for a bottle opener, sometimes it's a pain and I end up using something else."
3.0,I don't hate them but I also don't love them.  Material is kinda of cheap but it gets the job done somewhat.  Would not purchase again.
3.0,Not yellow.  Is mustard color.<br /> I may return. Color is so sad
3.0,These aren't as comfortable as I hoped they would be. And do not give me the right amount of pressure on my calves.
3.0,I'm going to order these in a smaller size. The shoes were huge on her long narrow foot. She loved them so much. They are beautiful. Going to try again.
3.0,"Blue dress: arrived just like the one in the model, even though I was hoping I'd get the blue and white version as seen in customer images from another buyer. Shrunk ridiculously on the lowest setting after just 10 minutes, so now the slip shows: a strip of the same blue linen at the bottom of the paler blue cotton slip. So the base layer is not the same linen fabric. Now I have to bring the cotton slip up on the sewing machine, which will change the length. Good thing I planned on wearing this over a longer skirt anyway, eh?<br /><br />Despite the disappointment, it's a nice dress. The tie back is built in, unlike the khaki version, which is just 2 loops and a loose tie. I like this version better."
3.0,Very cute seems narrow in the waste but looks like able to be stretched out for a more comfortable fit .
3.0,Super cute but the buckle broke within a few hours of wearing it..easy to snap back in black but now it pops back off frequently
3.0,"Runs a size small. The material is synthetic,  so it is a bit loud. For the price it can't be beats. It is extremely snug, I have to wear a cardigan with it."
3.0,Not excellent quality and not rue to size
3.0,"Pros: a decent price for the product. the material doesn't feel cheap, it's not see-through, it's soft.<br />Cons: The strap ripped off literally the first time i wore one. I'm not very upset, it's an easy fix. But just a little inconvenient."
3.0,Would be 5 stars if one sock wasn't missing........
3.0,"These are nice form-fitting shirts. They seem to be well-made and fit as expected. I''m 5' 8"", 200 lbs and the XL fits me perfectly.<br /><br />The problem I have and the reason for 3-stars is with the use of the word ""compression"" in the title. I bought this 3-pc set along with a single, more expensive compression shirt. The more expensive shirt does exactly what it says, provides compression. Compared to that shirt, these are just stretchy, form-fitting shirts. After doing some reading, these seem to me to be ""base Layer"" shirts. So to a non-expert like me, compression is misleading."
3.0,These are ok.  I have a regular size 6 foot.  Not wide or narrow.  I found the foot on these to be a bit snug. I will keep them for the wet lacrosse and soccer games that I go to here in Oregon.  I do not think they are worth $80.00.
3.0,"Nice good looking jean.  I am 5ft 8in 170 pounds, 32 fits me perfect."
3.0,not a bargain
3.0,"The dress is nice, but not as great as it looks in the picture. The sleeves are shorter, about elbow length. It‚Äôs not as long as I want it to be, about ankle length, and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10. Material is kind of thin, but it‚Äôs soft and stretchy, fits very comfortably. Overall, the quality and attributes of this dress is expected for the price."
3.0,"It is NOT stretch material, but overall it‚Äôs a cute outfit but choose size wisely my top fit perfect but skirt too small."
3.0,Cute long shirt. By no means should it be listed as a cardigan. It is very light weight poly material. Priced accordingly.
3.0,"Doesn‚Äôt fit as shown at all The only good part is the material is comfy elastic but sizes not right also neck super wide, pocket zone makes you look like a pregnant"
3.0,"The quality seems pretty good, the fit isn't bad, but it flares out below the waist more than I think it should. The pleats up front are totally opened up despite the fact I can cinch down the belts to near the smallest size. So it's not like I ordered too small and am filling it out too much. It just seems like they sewed it a bit small so that the pleats are flared out even when standing straight. Other than that I think it's fine but I'm returning it."
3.0,Pretty and true to color but they're plastic beads instead of the stone like material I'm used to
3.0,Cute and I like the brown gradual fade of the lenses however they are huge!!! They cover from way above my eyebrows and hit the middle of my cheeks. I will use them for driving because there is no way I can wear them seriously.
3.0,Was a gift and was pretty but very stiff and kinda cheap looking. Thinking it was made more for teenagers.
3.0,Very nice looking glasses but if you have a big graduation in the lenses they become to heavy to carry
3.0,"The uniform itself was very nice.  Good material and construction.  Top had a side zipper for easier off and on.  However, the &#34;Amazon Women's Apparel Size Chart&#34; cannot be trusted at all! The garment runs very small.  I ordered an XL even though I'm a 34&#34;-27&#34;-34&#34;, because I expected it to run small.  I could barely get the shirt on.  And once on, couldn't really move my shoulders or lift my arms, so I sent it back."
3.0,Gloves did not cover your wrist.
3.0,Alot bigger than I thought
3.0,the description says it comes with a chain...mine did not i reached out to them 3 times...the first 2 i got a prompt response.....now i feel like i am being ignored..and still have no chain.
3.0,Doesn't breath well but it is cool
3.0,"The length is ideal depending on the look you're going for. However, if you are tall and want sleeves that for this isn't the choice for you. They are the length of 3/4 sleeves"
3.0,The kids size was too small for my average sized 12 yr old child. Returned but cute item for smaller child.
3.0,"I only gave this three stars because even though it's pretty it is not the color it looks like in the picture. The pose is the same, her face and hair is the same, it's not bluish-lavender. It's more like dark blue. The has two stones on her wings that looks like diamonds.  Can barely see what's in her hands."
3.0,They stay in place for everything except running. it makes it impossible. Nothing in pockets to weigh down or anything. I cant run in these even for a minute. Good for all other workouts though (Yoga/cycling/weights)
3.0,SIZE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER
3.0,"Fits a bit tighter than other Miusol and FYI, the button doesn't work.  It's just sewn on top of the fabric.  Had to return."
3.0,"These are heavy-weight shorts, an oxymoron in my world. They are very well made, but the compression liner made them feel very tight. I gave them away to my skinnier step-son."
3.0,"Stones are bright and clear.  Metal is soft, scratches easily, smudges and looks greasy if touched.  Wipe with a cloth after putting on to make them shiny and don't get finger prints on them.  Is what should be expected for this price."
3.0,I sized up and it was still too big.
3.0,Cute top but the fit was ridiculous. It was way too big and made me look like I was drowning in fabric. I had to send it back.
3.0,"Nice, but definitely cheaply made.  I took mine apart and put the pendants on a zipper-pull on my laptop bag and they look really good there, but I wouldn't wear them as regular jewelry."
3.0,"Pretty dress, very lightweight. The arm holes are large for me and the dress itself is a bit short. I am 5'9"" and weigh 160 lbs, for reference. Fine as long as the wind isn't blowing. Better used as a beach cover up."
3.0,It fits but not really what I was expecting. It‚Äôs not very comfortable to wear.
3.0,They fit nice but they do run small... If you buy you have to go up a few sizes
3.0,Cute but poor quality. Shirt is thin and stiff.
3.0,I was so happy to get this package and i can't seem to get the tights over my bum all the way /:
3.0,"It okay for the price, it ripped during sex though like right away lol not too much of a complaint haha but very cheap"
3.0,Nice but pockets open up and was I my slide up...
3.0,the size was a surprise and it is shown with a chain but not delivered with it.
3.0,It's stinkin' cute but way too small up top
3.0,"Returned it because it was at least 2 sizes too large. However, I will reorder but two sizes smaller. Originally got the XL in blue. I‚Äôm 36C, 170/180 right now. I usually wear an XL. This went to my knews at 5‚Äô2‚Äù so no worries about wearing it with leggings for you taller ladies. Its a nice shirt and comfy. Just dont get it so huge it looks like youre swimming like I did. Ill reorder in a M. Thanks!"
3.0,fabric ruffle is stiff.
3.0,"I guess you get what you pay for.  I bought this shirt because I saw a nice one in the mall but it was $45.  Couldn‚Äôt pass up spending $20 instead.  Unfortunately, it seems like a fairly cheap iron on job.  I‚Äôve only washed it once so far so I can‚Äôt attest to how well it holds up.  Looking back, I‚Äôd probably rather spend the $45 on the shirt I saw at the mall."
3.0,I‚Äôve just tried it on. 1st neck hole could be bigger. 2nd the top part could be longer. The band part couldn‚Äôt go lower than my belly button so the shirt part isn‚Äôt very loose fitting. Like a shirt tucked into pants. If you have a long torso not for you. I do like how the legs have elastic.
3.0,"THE BLING IS NICE, BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE LOOSE, ALSO THE WHOLE MASK ISNT COVERED , THE MIDDLE. OF THE MASK IS JUST CLOTH , AND SOME OF THE STONES FELL OFF BEFORE I COULD USE THE MASK, BUT ITS CUTE FOR THE MOST PART."
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt look like picture. The material is all wrong- it‚Äôs clingy due to the fabric. It looks like a nurses outfit. Had high hopes for this.
3.0,The style looks good in a picture but in reality it‚Äôs not very flattering as below the top part it poofs out. I think I‚Äôll take the ornamental buttons off and maybe it lie smoother
3.0,"I went by the size chart provided and ordered an XL, but I usually wear a M/L. It is a bit too big, but it will be nice in the spring/summer as a more flowing dress. It is beautiful and true to color. It's on the shorter side, too."
3.0,Cute costume! However I had to re-sew the arm & neck wraps. Way too large. The zipper broke at a party! Typical cheaply made costumes!
3.0,"Lovely, but very small and I've been to 4 different jewelers to find a necklace. No clamp comes with it, so it's going to be hard to locate a necklace thin enough. But otherwise, lovely message and beyond special because it's from ISRAEL!"
3.0,The shoes are adorable but sadly were to slippery to wear on our laminate flooring. Probably a better fit for carpet floors.
3.0,"They are BEAUTIFULLY Crafted I really do like them and plan to keep them however they are not cotton, they are silk. They will work well as pocket squares but not for handkerchiefs."
3.0,"Has a shoulder line sewn in, so it does not fit all. It fits a small person or child. Nice for a costume effect, not fashion."
3.0,"DO NOT ORDER A SIZE BIGGER! I bought this item and really liked it except I ordered a larger size (I wear a L, and ordered a XL) and it was huge on me. The comments I read said order a size up, so I did. They are made very thin also."
3.0,I liked this shirt a lot but it didnt come with the rope already tied on like the picture. In fact the holes of the shirt for the rope is way too small to even attemp to string it yourself. That was the big disappointment. You would have to buy some other ribbon or string for this. The quality of the material isnt bad though. Its soft.
3.0,"The dress runs small we ordered it 2 full sizes bigger then she is and it just fits. The zipper is not well made so we are not going to mess with it for fear of it braking before the wedding. The lace and look of the dress is beautiful, very soft and fits well if you order it bigger then your usual size. shipped faster then they said it would. Looks great with a jean jacket and cowboy boots to give it a cute country wedding look!"
3.0,"These pants just arrived today.  They fit great, like any other pants would.  They are also comfortable.  I think they will make good pants, but I gave 3 stars because I ordered the Army Green color but I received black.  So, I'm disappointed with that.  I'm not sure if I'll send them back or not."
3.0,They are uncomfortable with lots of extra fabric that gets caught in your mouth. Stick with enerplex ones. This is an obvious copy but not very good
3.0,"The product fit snuggle, my torso is too long"
3.0,The space for the second toe is too short.
3.0,My son loved them. They didn't last long. The remote didn't come with the shoe so it was eventually sent after contacting seller along with new lights to go with the remote. Shoe eventually stopped working. My son kicked them to the curb.
3.0,"Nice Glasses, Very light weighted , not my normal Gucci feel for sunglasses"
3.0,"There's not a whole lot I can say about this pendant, really.  It is a decent value. It looks quite nice and is very affordable, but the ring on top broke off pretty quickly; no crazy amount of stress, it was just hanging there."
3.0,Too large and had to return.
3.0,"I am a size 12 women's so after reading reviews I prefer the xl. It arrived quickly and the colors were spot on. From there though I was not impressed. The dress just hangs unattractively. While the pictures show body and structure to the dress it is just the opposite. While I wish I loved it, I think this might be a one time wear dress."
3.0,"This was a little bulkier than I expected, and not as fitted-however if u like to wear things a little on the looser side, this might be for you."
3.0,I ended up giving it to my daughter
3.0,"I wanted to love this shoe. Nice design. However, I found it to warm while wearing."
3.0,Not that comfortable to wear
3.0,Much smaller than you would think
3.0,It is great fits right. Very sheer could not wear it out more like a bathing suit cover.
3.0,"Did not like how they looked.  Was not pleased how they fitted, too loose, not enough support."
3.0,"I have recently gained a bit of weight so I needed to update my summer wardrobe unless I wanted to be even more uncomfortable in my own body.<br />This top is more fitting than I was hoping and the material is the kind that isn't always flattering to my figure. I was planning on trying to sell it, but I have lost a few pounds so I decided to try again.<br />I do like the fit better now but unsure if I will actually be comfortable enough to wear it in public or if I will wait until I lose a few more pounds.<br />Otherwise, I love the color and it is soft and comfortable."
3.0,"This dress was exactly what I expected....I didn't think it would work, but I loved the design so much I had to take a chance. The material is incredibly thin and transparent, and it wrinkles very easily. The fit is not great - for one, it was far too big (I am 5'5&#34;, 109lbs, so most things are too big). But I could tell that even if it fit perfectly, it just wouldn't have that flattering of a fit. It's a pretty cheap dress, so you can't expect too much...I guess I did though! It was returned."
3.0,Got a 34 should have got a 36. Get a size up forsure.
3.0,I was looking forward to receiving these earrings.  The size is good but the purple is so dark you can't tell it's purple.. Returning
3.0,"I ordered a medium and I love the fit! There‚Äôs little to no compression, but they‚Äôre super comfy! I was sad about the color, forest green described the color, however they‚Äôre blue green- more blue than green. I expected a more green color when I opened them and thought I was sent the wrong color! I do love the fit so much. I‚Äôll buy other colors, but the description is misleading."
3.0,Too narrow. They are attractive and good to keep in purse
3.0,Really nice finish
3.0,"The &#34;daughter&#34; keychain was all scratched up. Thankfully, the &#34;Mom&#34; keychain was perfect as this was a gift for her. I kept the daughter one."
3.0,Some were dead on arrival.
3.0,"The size is a bit off. I have the Amanda jeans in a size 4 short, and the Amanda trousers size 6 is more like a tight 4.  I had to return them."
3.0,"I am unable to wear shorts with traditional waistbands because of scarring from multiple abdominal surgeries. I need to have pants that are loose and baggy around the scar areas so I'm n it in any pain or discomfort. For reference, I am 5'5"" and weigh 170lbs. I am usually able to wear a size xl comfortably with room to spare. Unfortunately, this pair of shorts isn't comfortable. It is at least one size too small, sits up high on the waist, and has pockets that dig into the hips. The fabric, although soft, doesn't breathe very well. I wore them for the first time today in a typical August Arizona day (105 degrees), and I was warm. If the shorts were offered in one size larger, perhaps the story would be different. Unfortunately, this is one pair of wants I'm not too happy with."
3.0,Pretty but hurt my ears after having them on over a couple of hours.
3.0,I bought this jacket for my husband as a Christmas present. We both love the design and everything but there is a problem. We find out it is a little bit difficult to zip up for some reason....
3.0,I didn't know it was plastic I shouldve read it before anything. its turning colors. Blah blah blah blah .
3.0,Smaller than expected for the queen size.
3.0,Mor like tee shirt material than than sweatshirt.
3.0,"I ordered the size 5-7 years for my 5 year old who normally wear a size 6. The underwear are soft and have unique, kid friendly patterns. They did fit as far as the waist. There is an elastic band and they did hold up the underwear for the day. However, as he was wearing them for the day, they began to get loose. They were so loose that when he pulled up his pants, the underwwear would puff out of the top. When I tried to fix it, I noticed they were too loose to stay in place and just came up with his pants as he pulled them up. Overall, I think they are okay."
3.0,Ok. Material was not that soft .
3.0,I ordered two of these. Both in the same size XX Large. One short sleeve which fits perfectly and one long sleeve that is two sizes smaller then the short sleeve one. So disappointed
3.0,"These are not what I expected to get for $17.  I ordered another pair of $7 sunglasses at the same time.  Only one pair showed up in the first order.  I figured these were the cheaper ones.  Nope.  They are slightly better than the quality of 3D movie glasses, but not as good as sunglasses you'd get at a drugstore or Walmart for the same price."
3.0,"I ordered the olive green color but when it arrived, it looks more pastel green"
3.0,The product was not the greatest but they returned my money and let me keep this. I‚Äôll have to get rid of it anyways but that is good service.
3.0,Very oversized
3.0,"I liked the fit and they are really comfortable, but did not have them on half a day when they tore up at seams where elastic is. I‚Äôve had other brands and this is the first time this happens and I bought them a little bigger for comfort. I love the idea of the pockets and they really feel great, but just need to pay attention to the seams and make them double sewed there."
3.0,"Fits nicely but the color is not the same as shown in the picture. The color does not look purple, it looks more like a light burgundy üôÑ"
3.0,These are fun and looked as expected but it was hard to squeeze the &#34;egg&#34; out of a few of the chickens (they just weren't full enough to do so).
3.0,"Cute, good little stress toy, but already I see little cracks in it, and I am worried it may break."
3.0,Very cute but awkward when tied how it is in the picture
3.0,"like another review i saw, they are not as pictured, but they‚Äôre still kind of what i was looking for. they definitely are not fleece sweat shorts, but they‚Äôre still nice shorts for doing things outdoors! the only pair i would BEWARE of is the white pair! totally see through. i plan to wear a pair of shorts under mine, or use it as a pair of shorts to wear over my swim suits. but, the black & gray pairs are good! so, even though it was not as pictured, i still like them! just disappointed that the seller couldn‚Äôt use more realistic pictures."
3.0,"Nice idea, but material is not great quality. Uneven hem.  Returned."
3.0,"It keeps you warm, but it's to stiff and the buttons fall off."
3.0,Good v4m but somehow cheap when in hand.
3.0,"The bag is beautiful and appears big however, the inside is small and it's hard to open to get things in and out at the top."
3.0,"For the price it‚Äôs not terrible, but it did have a few flaws that were a little disappointing. The small piece of elastic that was sewn on the front to create the sweetheart neckline, was off center which ruined the dress. Also the lace was cut extremely haphazardly making it look worse."
3.0,"This runs small with no stretch. Had to return, so tight in bust(38/C - 5'5""/125)& very short. Would've worn bike shorts too and fringe was falling immediately."
3.0,"This was a super cute and flattering swim suit, but the top was too large- there was SO much give it felt like it was blowing around. Then the shorts were too tight and felt extremely restrictive."
3.0,A bit on the bigger side
3.0,"Est√°n hermosos , mi hija los am√≥.  Pero tienen diferentes tama√±os siendo la misma talla ."
3.0,"The style is beautiful and I would have loved to wear it, but I ordered the pink and it is pretty much exactly the same color as my (very pale) skin. It does not contrast as nicely as it does on the super tan model! Have to return<br />:(((("
3.0,"This loupe is a nicely made about 10X loupe.  For a 10X loupe, it is quite nice and well priced."
3.0,I have heard that these type of durags bleed with the dye. So far I haven't experienced any issues. Easy to apply and looks cool on ya head. To me it doesn't really keep your waves in tack though or maybe it depends on the texture of your hair.
3.0,This is not what I thought its beautiful on the model but looks smaller than I thought I ended up giving to my granddaughter it‚Äôs more like a sports bra not for me
3.0,"Great looking frames.  I have a metal allergy and live in a hot climate, so the coating on the frames prevents them from corroding, getting too hot on my face, or breaking me out.  The lens size, bridge and arms are great.  They are comfortable, but slightly heavy compared to other thinner frames.  It doesn't bother me as I only need them for reading and they spend a lot of time resting on my forehead.  Good for the money and classic good looks."
3.0,Wife liked it had it been a little larger. The lower band curls up while wearing it
3.0,A little short on the torso and a little smaller than expected but super cute!
3.0,Not what I expected might can use as a bathing suit cover up
3.0,"Size L fit as expected with consideration for layering - 5'6"", 150 lbs. I'm not knocking North Face at all because I've been happy with previous Goretex jacket, fleece, etc. but this was not what I was expecting. I'm sure it is great for backpacking (as many backpacker sites review this as being a top pick for the price) in a downpour when you are outside all day long with no cover and want to remain dry or at least dry from the rain...but I cannot stand wearing something like this. It was suffocating like a plastic bag, with zero liner and stiff as a board. It also did not look as cute on either as in all the photos. I sent it back and got a Columbia Cabot Trail jacket and love it."
3.0,Love the still.....just too much showing for me....but is nice
3.0,They are hard to get on my feet!
3.0,Too long- way too long and big.  Almost like a ballgown.  I gave it away.  And the material felt like a parachute.
3.0,Way to large for my face. Had to return.
3.0,"These are ok, but I was looking for evidently the &#34;old&#34; mesh underwear. Did they change the fabric because I have bought quite a few packages of the UA Mesh underwear in the size I need and they are running smaller than the older UA Mesh."
3.0,"Runs small, fabric is tissue weight and see through. Would be ok for a coverup but not to wear out, which is what I was looking for. Returned."
3.0,I really like the shorts however after 3 months of use they are already the threads on the belt loops are already coming apart.  Not sure how much longer they are going to last.  I only go on long rides 2 times a week so they have not been overused by any means.
3.0,"fun stocking stuffer, but the run sort of small for adult feet"
3.0,"They are okay, but three are misspelled. Taurus, Leo and Sagittarius. I should‚Äôve looked at them closely before buying these. I‚Äôm not going to use these three signs and Taurus and Leo, are what I needed. Especially Taurus.."
3.0,Very cute I love the colors but it didn‚Äôt fit I had to file it to make it work
3.0,"I loved this hat, Collors and lacy texture. It looked good on me and I was so happy. Then I broke a nail and caught one tread with it. I can't fix it. So this item needs special handleing."
3.0,I understand that the stones are synthetic. I've gotten similar before. I was disappointed with the dullness and lack of finish of this set.
3.0,"While it is incredibly adorable. The head hole is too tight for the sizing of the rest of the hoodie. I bought it large so my daughter could get more than a year out of it, however this particular hoodie ran small to begin with and the head sizing was just too small to continue getting use out of for more than one season."
3.0,"The shirt itself is adorable, especially when paired with a black sports skirt. It's thin and cool...but the only issue is it's a little too thin. I had to wear a tank under it. Overall it was still very comfortable though.<br /><br />Washes well and doesn't shrink. The black did fade slightly, but not enough to cause an issue.<br /><br />So if you're willing to layer up a bit or your home course doesn't mind the bra through the shirt look, it's definitely worth it."
3.0,"The beanie looks good and the quality of the material is fine. However, both the woven top and fleece liner are as thin as they could possibly make it. By comparison, if you purchase an Eddie Bauer merino wool beanie, it will be twice the weight for the same price.  Personally, the thinness would be acceptable if this was a WindStopper or comparable product, but that's not the case. A quality Autumn beanie."
3.0,The skirt fabric is too heavy for the t-shirt fabric that makes up the top of this dress. It would be best to get the dress in all one fabric.
3.0,"Not for the small wristed. They are a little floppy, but the quality is right on."
3.0,Ordered 18-24 and fits my child that‚Äôs in 3t 4t maybe they sent me the wrong size? It‚Äôs cute so we will just keep it but sad we can‚Äôt wear for a couple years.
3.0,They are possibility
3.0,I do like to rate it 5 stars if i got the case for it too.<br />The first one i bought came with case but for the 2nd was not. Soo disappoint. :((
3.0,"Expecting good quality, but isn't"
3.0,It‚Äôs cute but quality is China
3.0,One of the snaps broke after the first week of use. Disappointing.
3.0,"Love the dress, the material and how fast shipping was. Fits almost perfect. Could go to a small.  5'7 at 155 lbs hour glass shape.  However the stitching on the dress is comming apart and I have not even worn it out yet.:((. Only tried it on. Thought bout fixing it but no go. There were multiple spots on the dress. I will return the dress and purchase again.:)))"
3.0,They‚Äôre nice. Got the wrong size. Oh well
3.0,"I bought these socks because my other socks were quite thin and started wearing holes in them after maybe a year. I don't workout or run so that was just normal wear and tear on them. These socks have nice designs and feel mostly comfortable, however they are very very thin. You can feel everything in your shoes and since they are thin, I'm guessing they won't last long either. I would have liked to see a thicker sock, but hey I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,Disappointed had a hole in them
3.0,It's not a bad buy and it looks nice but for a nice fit it would be best to buy a size over
3.0,Seam around the arm unraveled and tore!
3.0,"Would like the casting to be a lot more sharp, with more definition"
3.0,Nice but didn‚Äôt really fit me that well unfortunately. It‚Äôs kind of baggy and little too short on the slit side so it‚Äôs not very flattering.
3.0,"Not quite as formal as I was expecting. It was pretty, but I was afraid that I would rip the latest. My ring kept getting snagged on it (though I caught it and saved it from ripping)."
3.0,"This band is stiff, but it does conform to my wrist. It is durable and does not irritate my skin like the OEM band did, however it is still uncomfortable after a few hours. The band comes with the tools needed for installation and replacement pins. I'm not as happy with this band after a year, as I was when it was new."
3.0,Washed one time and the metal piece already fell out.
3.0,"I ordered a L in the Aqua and the design and fabric are heavenly. They do run very small so I would recommend ordering a size or two up. So disappointed because exactly what I wanted for my FIRST pair of yoga pants, color, soft, airy, pockets. I will not hassle with a return so will give to one of my slimmer daughters.  I am giving a 3 because the pants look comfy (if Fits) and fabric is glorious!"
3.0,The plating starts to come off after a couple of wears.However it is relatively inexpensive so you get what you pay for.
3.0,"The top is precious and fits my 11-year-old well. Very tasteful! BUT, the bottoms are made for a Victoria‚Äôs Secret model. Doesn‚Äôt cover the butt cheeks AT ALL. Not for young girls for sure!"
3.0,"It does fits as expected and looks as pictures. The material is pretty thick and resistant. But what I didnt like  it the zipper, is little strong and hard to use and some of the fur stuck on it each time and its frustrating. Plus the white fur is falling since day 1 as you see on pictures, so Im a little worried that it will no be fur at all after a while"
3.0,"Needed some thermal style shirts for work, these are ok"
3.0,"I love the style and comfort of these rings! As a pool operations manager, I use my hands a lot every day and love that I don‚Äôt have to worry about damaging my wedding ring. I wear these rings every day I‚Äôm at work! From in-water coaching to working on machinery, these rings did not last more than a couple of months. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me or if it‚Äôs a common thing, but that‚Äôs been my experience! Overall, I‚Äôm pleased with my purchase and would purchase again once all of them have worn down."
3.0,"Other's have reported this as well, it fits tightly around the shoulders,  I need help getting it off,  it works honestly I would have not bought the whole suite for my self my wife got it as a gift for me,  but it does the job and for the price I'm not going to give it a bad review.  The elastic on the feet and wrists is solid,  the mesh stays away from the face very well and I have never gotten stung through it,  the zipper and covers are a nice touch"
3.0,The rings become discolored and can irritate my piercing. I usually wear them for 24 hours tops. Good for having style options.
3.0,"This ring, while beautiful, gave me a blister because of whatever the heck was on the inside of the face. Very dissapointed and sad"
3.0,"I‚Äôm so disappointed. I ordered 3 of these previously. Loved them. Well I needed a new pair. Just got it today. While it looks pretty much the same while wearing they seem way less durable, flimsy and cheap compared to the old ones. It‚Äôs the same link when I click on ‚Äúpreviously purchased‚Äù. In their defense they DID update the pictures but I really wish they wouldn‚Äôt have changed the glasses. The pictures show the difference. The old ones have the little decal on the arms and are just all around more sturdy and substantial."
3.0,I have had this shirt in my cart forat least 2 months and kept looking at it and wanting it so I finally got it as a Christmas gift. I should I have listened to the person who said the colors were off. It's much much prettier in the picture than it is in person. The colors are kind of muted in the picture but the red is screaming bright and is the predominant color in the shirt. I would not have ordered it if I could have seen it first in person. Will update about the fit later. Overall I would have to say I am disappointed though.
3.0,I didn‚Äôt like the material that was made of and it doesn‚Äôt stretch much. But if this is on sale then yeah get it.
3.0,I read the reviews all stating how these ran small so I ordered one size up. The length is alright but the width is to narrow. I hate returning things so I will make do with shoving my feet into them until my heel is in the proper spot. Of course they work their way forward again then I will pull them up higher on the bridge of my foot. Now that I've said all this I'm wondering why I don't return the darn thingsü§î I have planters faciatis and they are so heavenly on my heels. So there you have it order at your own risk.
3.0,The material looks like plastic and the color is darker than the photo.
3.0,"one pair was crooked. vision seems to be a little stronger than what is described. lightweight, thin.  hope they hold up. packaged well."
3.0,Simple. Very thin. Not much to it.
3.0,Worked well for a bach party. I just wished the colors were as vibrant as the pictures.
3.0,Great shirt just ran very small
3.0,Very see through and material not the greatest.
3.0,Cute and lightweight great for packing.
3.0,Shrunk after Washing
3.0,Fabric clings on wrong parts... not flattering at all.
3.0,The sleeves are to tight and the material is very cheap. Do not feel it would protect anyone from the rain.
3.0,These pink chips are simply delicious.
3.0,"Seemed to be well made and the price was reasonable, but it was no where near a size 7 3/8. More like a 7 5/8. Much too large. I have three other hats that are 7 3/8 and all fit perfectly. This came down over my ears. It would have cost almost the price of the hat to return it, so I gave it away."
3.0,"I received just the top with no shorts.  The top did not even have the bra.  It just came with two pads that couldn't even be attached.<br /><br />The seller, Bonvince, was very receptive and is issuing a refund, so there's that.  This is why I gave it three stars.  1 Star for the product, but 5 for the seller, for an average of 3 stars."
3.0,"Nice, very petite. For me was perfect size.  But the claw hasp did not last.  Broke after wearing only three times. I'm used to wearing delicate jewelry.  The chain is very thin. It's holding up. But now it's useless without the claw hasp."
3.0,"Let me start by saying it really is a beautiful piece, but unfortunately not for ashes. The design on the pendent is quite detailed and very much worth it, if your wanting just a necklace. The chamber is just to small for anything to fit, and have it closed"
3.0,Over all nice
3.0,Returned too small. The white polka dot dress has a larger size chart. It said I was 3x when I clicked 3x it showed other dresses in that size; however they used a different sizing chart to get that size. Super frustrating.
3.0,Top part fit me.  The bottom part for me did not work very long.  I'm 4'11 lace is nice.
3.0,This product is okay. It wasn't exactly what I envisioned...the yarn is thicker than  I imagined it would be honestly and quality is meh. I'm used to cardigans and shrugs feeling different than this.
3.0,"I didn't like how the fabric bunched up under armpit, I ordered a vest and a long sleeved swim suit instead."
3.0,Huge ear muffs and keeps the ears warm. Does not fold tho
3.0,"Disappointed. Shoes are very flat with zero support or cushioning, so uncomfortable to walk. Returned. I gave one star for a beautiful khaki color and another one for a pretty good soft suede. My suggestion for prospective buyers: get a bigger size than you'd normally wear and put some insert in. Then these booties should be fine. Good luck!"
3.0,"The zipper wasn't sewn properly and it was missing a much needed hook but given the price, worth it."
3.0,"Relieved broken, luckily used gems from earrings to adjust necklace."
3.0,I really like it but the material is thinner than I expected and does not feel durable. Have had it long enough to say if it is actually durable or not.
3.0,These are good quality for the price I just think they look kinda dumb on me
3.0,Orderes my usual size. It runs big. It was also very thin and see through at the top.
3.0,Runs big but looks like good Material !
3.0,The style is nice 5but it runs small.
3.0,Runs big but perfect for around the house
3.0,"Very comfortable looking skirt, but looks at least 2 sizes too large. I re-ordered 2 sizes smaller and hope that works."
3.0,"I bought this product for my wife and our dog. The pieces fit together well. The necklace turned out pretty as did the tag. Unfortunately, the collar tag broke after about 3 days of our dog running around in the backyard. The clasp held on to the collar fine, but the connection piece between the clasp and the actual tag must have broke."
3.0,Some parts of it fit and the bottom parts I found to be loose.
3.0,"Pretty and lots of variety, but a lot of them fell apart fairly quickly."
3.0,Super cheaply made.<br />It looks like it was made with sewing thread.<br />Returning it!!!
3.0,They were hard for me to use. Two of them stripped while tightening them. The ones that did work are fine.
3.0,way too big in the bust.
3.0,Shirt fit fine after I figured out front from back!  How hard is it to put a tag or stamp on the back collar?
3.0,Not the best quality. But it‚Äôs costume jewelry. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"I bought this for my wife but it is more masculant,  and may be better for a man because is not very feminan,"
3.0,It needs a elastic adjustable cord to hold it up on your face or neck
3.0,This wallet has lots of compartments for your credit cards but the leather is very stiff and the zipper is quite big and crude.  I was hoping for a softer leather and not this big bulky wallet that looks and feels more like a man's wallet than a women's wallet.
3.0,"This is a beautiful hat.  HOWEVER, I have a large head and relied on the statement that it would fit up to a 23.2&#34; head.  IT DOES NOT.  The interior circumference at full extension is 22&#34;.  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A LARGE HEAD SIZE."
3.0,Like they are sturdy. Did not like the pearls did not fit in most of the charms.
3.0,"I lift a few times a week and do Krav Maga and BJJ.  I'm 6'0"", 260lb, dad gut, broad shoulders.  I wanted a sleeveless for my own reasons.  I normally wear XL, but I find that XXL rash guards tend to fit well (semi-snug).  I ordered an XXL for this product.<br /><br />TOO SMALL!  The XXL fit more like a Medium.  It took work to pull it over my frame and get it set in place.  When I took it off, it was the first time I had a sensation of having to ""peel"" clothing off myself.  The neck rides a little high and reminds me of the faux-turtlenecks I wore years ago.  The lower hem has a rubber lining which will help keep the rash guard from riding up, and I found it personally annoying.<br /><br />Other than that, the stitching seemed agreeable, the material firm, and will probably hold up for anyone's athletic needs.  However, this seems like a product suitable for people who are already in excellent shape.<br /><br />If you don't have that dad-bod, I'd order at least one size up."
3.0,"Initially,  for the price I paid for this blouse I wasn't expecting a lot, however I was surprised by how much I really like it. It's  true, the neck opening is a tad bit on the small side so there's a little struggle with getting it over your cranium. In addition,  the waist is a little tight which makes it a little uncomfortable but it's bearable.  The pocket is not a real one bit a strip of fabric sewn onto the shirt. The material at first seems subpar but when you put it on, it's very soft. The colors are very vibrant and if you go up two sizes you should be fine.  All-in-all, it's a cute blouse that with all its faults you can still see the positives. It's a glass half empty half full kind of scenario.  All in all, I like it. I plan to wear it under a blazer or cardigan, with skirts or jeans and I'm sure it'll be a hit."
3.0,Love the jacket but it's a little snug and it would have been to offer battery pack on right side instead of left ( I'm left handed and ) not enough for variety pack and firearm on that side.
3.0,It arrived faster than expected. Fabric was thinner than hoped for but it‚Äôs fine. My kid will outgrow and it won‚Äôt be a huge loss of investment.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift and was disappointed when it arrived.  I don't know much about jewelry and weights, etc., but I expected something heavier for the price.  It looks nice, but REALLY light when you hold it... I prefer the heavier gold.  Not worth the price if I had to do it again."
3.0,"For the money I feel it‚Äôs worth it, it‚Äôs not topnotch material but it‚Äôs worth the price I guess. I ordered two sizes larger and if it was a size smaller it would be too tight but the arm length is a little to long going two sizes larger. Stitching is not the best either it‚Äôs ur basic wear and tear gym compression long sleeve."
3.0,"The material is very pretty, but sheer. You can see through it."
3.0,"I almost gave this 4 stars, because I actually do like it, but I kind of like it in spite of itself. The amount of polyester in this product makes it very shiny-plastic looking and very thin (I have to wear a shirt underneath), thought it is quite comfy. Your shoulders WILL get cold in an air conditioned space (not a problem, just an observation).<br /><br />The fit was exactly as expected and I love the color and design, but the material just makes it look as cheap as it is.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice shirt (especially for the price), but I didn't want to give it a 4 and have people miss the fact that it has a &#34;major drawback.&#34;"
3.0,Runs small. Fabric is not forgiving.
3.0,Good product. They also sell this brand @ Macys. Ran too small. Maybe by only one size. Had to return. But may buy in future. Great colors.
3.0,"These are made of some kind of shiny material not sweats material. But they are comfortable and cool looking, just not what I expected"
3.0,"I was surprised at how tightly these socks fit. They almost felt like compression socks. Since they‚Äôre tight, they don‚Äôt slip off of the heel while walking, and they offer a lot of support. I was, however, happy to take them off at the end of the day. There‚Äôs not a lot of give in the elastic."
3.0,"I'm sad to return this because I think the style is extremely cute, and overall it looks amazing except that it does NOT compensate for my bubble butt. At 5'6&#34; 120 and a size small, everything feels nice except that the elastic just digs into my booty, and if I pull it down over the butt then my buttcrack just shows. Contemplating trying a medium..."
3.0,"Looks just like the picture, is very cute but definitely not for a newborn. Maybe a 1 year old could fit this."
3.0,Low quality material.
3.0,"This item was very large, much larger than an average face mask."
3.0,"Really liked the style of the dress, but it was slightly see through unfortunately. And tight enough that wearing shapewear or a slip would show. Had to go back."
3.0,"The shirt is comfy but it looks and fits more like a youth size.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 130 pounds and the length is short."
3.0,Cute shirts and they look like they are good quality but one of the shirts is different than the one pictured. The sizes are also pretty varied between the two shirts. The dance mode shirt is more like a 5 or 6T and the other is more like the 4T that I ordered.
3.0,Nice colors and good to mix with another bracelet I purchased.
3.0,"These are cute, but I felt like they were WAY bigger in person than in the picture. I don't wear them because they're so giant."
3.0,lovely but too small
3.0,The back neck aches cuz of the widness of the strap and the eypatch is wayy bigger nd weird way to set up.
3.0,I wish they were larger
3.0,A little too small for my wallet.  It doesn't snap and it doesn't stay tied.  But it looks good.
3.0,"My 10 year old Granddaughter loved it, however, it is so clingy that she can't remove it herself. Needs an adults help to get the dress off. The belt is also too small for a size 16. More like a 12 or 14.  It does look nice without the belt though."
3.0,"Really good Looking, confy but.... using for 2 month and already falling a part"
3.0,It stained
3.0,not entirely accurate
3.0,"I ordered a XXXL because many times with products like this they seem to run super small and figured this looked like one of those chippies that would do that.  I normally fit into a XXL pretty comfortably.  Sure enough this XXXL is still too small.  There is actually room enough in the chest and gut area but if I took both of my arms and move them forward with a double bicep hulk flex, I could definitely blow the back out of this thing.  Outside of that the reflective areas are fine, but I definitely don‚Äôt like the combination of the high viz. yellow with the navy blue.  I would rather see the dark parts be black, so it looks a little better.  Also pretty thin material. It was fine just being out in the cold, but when I went around the corner of the building I am at and the wind picked up. It goes right through this thing."
3.0,I haven't had them long enough to fairly evaluate (March '17). Get back to me later.
3.0,"I like the feel of them, expect what you paid for.<br />There are some spots that are see through, and you can somewhat see through on the butt part but you would have to look closely.<br />Wear a slightly longer shirt to over the butt, and you will be all good.<br />Wore them for a day doing a bunch of stuff and no rips or tears yet."
3.0,"These shoes are very comfortable and provide fantastic arch support for wearing around the house. I would give them 5 stars except, as I saw another reviewer point out, they do not breathe. AT ALL. My feet sweat in these things like no tomorrow. Socks or no socks, just wearing them around the house makes my feet sweat horribly. I have to wash these shoes at least once a week otherwise the smell would knock you out. It's very disappointing for how much they cost. If you don't mind stinky feet they are worth the comfort."
3.0,"I was disappointed that the flowers are printed on rather than actually embroidered like others I bought.<br />The smaller size is fine, nicely dainty in a purse.<br />I do not know yet how the printed on pattern will hold up in the washer. I will use cool water and delicate cycle. I expect to iron and that‚Äôs fine with me."
3.0,"Seems like there's different versions, but the one I got was only 1 button that heats up the whole vest.<br />There's another version that has 2 buttons that heats the chest and belly.<br /><br />Firstly, it needs a powerbank to work. This product does not ship with one, it says ""no battery"". I suggest a cheap, small 10,000mh powerbank, which powers the USB port and also has a pouch you can put the battery/powerbank, and it can be zippered and be out of the way.<br /><br />Secondly, the sizes run very small and usually I buy clothes in XL and they fit me perfectly, but this was very tight on my body. I thought I got a women's size but it just runs small, so I would suggest going 2-3x your size.<br /><br />The instructions get lost in translation, but it is able to be washed in the washer. If not there's always the handwashing available.<br /><br />Even so, the vest heats up within 1-2min, and it isn't extremely hot, but still comfy, in the highest setting, which is the red light. There are 2 other lights that turn the heat down.<br /><br />Overall, it makes a great gift for the holidays, just make sure you know the body type of the person you are giving it to."
3.0,Looks much better on the model than on me.
3.0,"Nice quality and look good, so I really wanted them to fit, but sadly did not. I typically wear normal shoe size 11.5 so for these I ordered both 12 and 13 (largest) sizes, due to reviews saying fit was slightly small.  I would argue more towards runs ""very"" small than slightly so... Couldn't even get my foot into the 12, and while I could with the 13 my toes were cramped to the end, so returning both and looking elsewhere."
3.0,Need bigger hoops
3.0,"Zipper unzipped from the middle 2x but was able to fix Other than that, it was a nice warm jacket.  Will need to see if I can exchange."
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt helpful with Pilates. I didn‚Äôt like the feel of the socks. Bare feet was better.
3.0,"I wear an XL but thought I'd get a 2XL so I'd have a little more room after washing it. I tried it on and it looked like a dress on me. It swallowed me. While it was comfortable, I had to return it."
3.0,"I have had the belt for awhile , bought it because the price was very reasonable. very nice but the holes are ripping the belt apart  rhe leather is not strong enuff."
3.0,I liked this skirt a lot and after reading reviews I decided to purchase it.  I should've ordered 2 sizes down as the material is stretchy.  Although it still fits I would've liked to to fit a little tighter.  I have a short torso so if it rides up off my hips it will look weird.
3.0,Fabric was not what I expected. They have a tiny sheen to it like spandex material. I thought it would be more like stretchy cotton. Also a bit big for my baby's head.
3.0,Loved the item every one loved it but it unraveled a lot by day two of wearing it I lost 2 threads
3.0,My husband was really excited to receive this for his birthday and immediately went to find the Shire. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not really showing on the map/apron at all. Pretty disappointing.
3.0,"El vestido est√° muy bonito, exepto que la parte de abajo est√° mucho m√°s obscura que la foto."
3.0,"I ordered the same style dress in different material and it was perfect.  Unfortunately, this one is too short and I have to return it."
3.0,Love the shirt but it ran way too small. Ordered a 3xl and it was more like a large.
3.0,Cute dress but not durable. material is thin
3.0,"Not a bad product, but very hard to open if you have arthritis in your hands."
3.0,I thought it was the actual designer that I searched for not a reproduction but it did show up in a timely manner and was cute.
3.0,I have this dress in an identical but sleeveless style from ‚ÄúGuberry‚Äù & it‚Äôs perfect in every way.  This one fits oddly.  The chest & sleeves were super tight but the waist was too loose.  I‚Äôll just wear a sweater with the ‚ÄúGuberry‚Äù dresses because life is too short for ill fitting clothes.
3.0,Ran kind of large and wide.  Front batman light stopped working after a couple days.  Side lights still work.  Have only been using them for a week now.
3.0,"ALOT of MONEY for a paper thin shirt,,this is not even a sweatshirt as it say's it is.  More like a cotton hoodie than anything. I will not purchase any of these anywhere again."
3.0,"The material is very bulky and scratchy feeling. It‚Äôs okay, but if I‚Äôd felt the material ahead of time, I‚Äôd probably not buy."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these as there arent many leggings that are really made for men. The main issue is the length, Im 5'10 with a 32&#34; inseam and running tights and leggings are usually and inch or 2 short as it is, but these are SUPER short. shortness aside, I really like the material, its soft and comfortable, and waist wise the fit is great. Ive attached some pics so you can see for yourself. (these photos should be ok since some of the others shown show way more)"
3.0,"For the price, you can't beat it.  Don't expect the gloves to last forever - great for preteens and teenagers who will lose their gloves all the time anyway."
3.0,"The shape isn‚Äôt great since it‚Äôs so thin, and if you are used to a body pillow with some weight, you are not going to get that with this pillow. It does help to underinflate it and sort of fold it sideways. That said it is better than nothing, esp when you travel to places with no or inadequate pillows."
3.0,"i like the style of the dress, but it just wasn‚Äôt for me. could have been the color or my body type. either way, unfortunately i will be sending it back. but it is a good buy for the material itself"
3.0,"I love them. The bars were a little long, but other than that they're good."
3.0,Yo short
3.0,"Great quality and great look.  Unfortunately, it did not fit my TAG.  After dealing with the vendor, who communicated just fine with me, I decided to send the item back.  Since we never got it to fit. Just waiting on a refund now. Hence the 3 stars.  If it would have fit it would be a 5 star rating."
3.0,Nice Bolo but the screw in the back gets lost.
3.0,"Really nice dress!!! Great material...soft fabric with a nice cling fit, however, the color is not as expected or described. This dress is not RED but more closer to salmon-pink, therefore rating is based on color description listed for this item on Amazon.<br /><br />As far as size, the size I ordered was a little large. I am 5&#34; 1&#34; and 180 lbs. I usually wear a 16-18 so I ordered the 1X to ensure for comfort and fit based on reviews. I ended up exchanging 1 size down to a Large and changed color to Black which fits perfect for my curvaceous body frame (smiles). Looking forward to wearing for NYE!"
3.0,definitely not sized for plus sized women
3.0,It's literally just a t shirt more than a dress but I still like the way it looks
3.0,Summarized above
3.0,"I have other Gaiam leggings that I love - granted they weren't compression leggings. But these were not attractive. I got the Bailey Black and they are going back the store. The butt was very unflattering compared to most yoga pants. Perhaps it was the pattern. Also, the medium (which I normally wear in all leggings and clothes) was super tight. I do have very large muscular legs so perhaps that was why they didn't look great. I will say they seemed like they would stay up but just didn't like them - they were slick and stretchy - and I was expecting a little more of a fabric feel."
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 157lbs. Usually wear a large in everything. According to this sizing I needed a 2x!
3.0,"The material for these feels soft in your hands, but the straps in particular are incredibly itchy. I haven't been able to wear them for an extended time as a result."
3.0,These leggings are pretty stretchy but I found out the hard way that the sizing is small. The design and fit is similar to jeggings only with a bit thicker material. The color was true deep black .
3.0,The lace up back broke about 5min wearing it luckily I can see other than that very cute
3.0,Good quality but wrong size. Had to sew myself
3.0,"Shirt was thin and the color was blue instead of black like I ordered. The style is adorable, love the shirt but wish the color was correct."
3.0,cute dress but slit is too high
3.0,"I don‚Äôt like that the small straps don‚Äôt detach. Otherwise, this is super cute and spacious."
3.0,Small. I am a 3x and I got the 5x and it fits like a 2x maybe. It is pretty. Don‚Äôt like the silky material. Nice dress though but just doesn‚Äôt fit me. I‚Äôll return it.
3.0,I have two other pairs I loved.  These seemed thicker and the material puckered in the rain!!
3.0,I color isn't staying it's fading and like most it's losing all changing colors to it and it already trying to go black where it won't changing
3.0,"Got these for my daughter, they are really cute pants.  Fit as expected but they are really crunching and loud.  Like windbreaker material only stiffer."
3.0,Did not work out for us. Didn't fit right. Very square like cut. Got a refund no issues.
3.0,"Though I would probably not give up my expensive name-brand sunglasses for this product, when close work or reading is required while outside in bright sunlight, these sunglasses are just the ticket. The 2.5x magnification is great for very close work, or reading extra-fine print."
3.0,Material is not of good quality. However I like that there is a slot for the 5 card i use most plus a slot for my driver‚Äôs license.
3.0,I wear a women‚Äôs size 7 1/2.  These socks are just a little short from toe to heel.  One size fits all is a little misleading.
3.0,"I didn't like the way these fit. I guess as a guy I'm not used to the racer-back style (which I wasn't aware these had when I was making the purchase - my bad), but even so, they have a really goofy fit. I got larges, which is usually what I wear, but I'm not fat by any means. I find that mediums are too tight across the chest and in the armpits for me, so a large allows a bit of extra room in those areas without looking too sloppy. However, these things fit like dresses. They are huge on me, not tapered at all, and they even seem to flare out at the bottom. In addition, they have a seam across the front that is not very appealing to look at. Overall, they look really dumb on me. Maybe they'll fit you better, but I wasn't impressed. The fabric is very thin, so I imagine they won't last long. That said, I've bought some hooded tees from this company that I really like, so don't let me make you think you should never buy from them. I'm just not a fan of this shirt at all."
3.0,"My daughter just turned 3 and wears a 3-4T, she is larger for her age, ordered a 3T in this shirt and was too big"
3.0,Overalls are cute but they just fit very well and the straps are super long!!!
3.0,The battery stopped working and no longer charges. Haven't been able to find a replacement. worked great when the battery worked.
3.0,My torso was too long for this outfit
3.0,"Arrived broken, luckily I was able to fix but only bc I work with jewelry often"
3.0,I like the sandal but the material between the toes is uncomfortable after a while.
3.0,"So, to start off this is NOT chiffon! It‚Äôs almost a spandex stretchy material. I‚Äôm usually a large but bought medium and fit well.  I bought to wear for a wedding but it almost looks too formal - almost like a bridesmaid dress. Returning."
3.0,"The color is nice and the print is dramatic. But the length hits me above the knee, not like the model in the picture, and feels awkward. I'm 5'9"" and the dress is almost too long for leggings and too short to wear without. If I don't figure out how to wear it, my much shorter daughters will be very lucky!"
3.0,"Came in a nice package, bagged, and with info on returns/refunds.<br />The colour of the ends are not like in the photo. It is practically clear, take my advice an get some solid colour ones. Also, I lost one end as soon as I first took  one out- Searched my CLEAN, just vacuumed floor for two hours and never found it"
3.0,"I don't really care for it, should have sent it back but I will wash it and see how it does."
3.0,The body suit was cute and fit great but I returned it because there was a hole at the end of the zipper.
3.0,Was Not cute in person and its not quite the purple I thought it was. More Fuchsia
3.0,"Runs very small, especially if you‚Äôre a big girl."
3.0,Too light. Cheap looking.
3.0,"Way to big. Can't reorder smaller size for same purchase price, cause I don't wanna pay twice as much. Guess the big girl size was on sale only."
3.0,Doesn't fit my body right
3.0,Cute socks a little see through they are more of a knitted sock
3.0,"Purchase two Party Queens a week apart.  I liked so much, purchased a 2nd one for a friend.  The 2nd Party Queen required us to super glue a stones that had fallen out, but was still in the container.  This process worked (stone a little cloudy looking) so we kept it  and gave the the 1st purchase as a gift.  Not too big of a deal!"
3.0,They r ok. I am keeping the turkey pair and gifting the rest at work
3.0,"Tougher than frogg toggs, but these four still rip like laminated paper, so be careful with them. This product has no annoying smell."
3.0,The sweat shirt is cute on but the design began to come off after a few washings.
3.0,"My daughter wore the toes off on the third day.  Aside from that, the sole seems comfortable. Obviously not as durable as I had hoped."
3.0,I ordered an xl and I can barely zip it and the buttons only came on one side and not the other. The arms are way to small. It‚Äôs a cute and very warm jacket though
3.0,"These were too small for my 6yo. The ear loop is not adjustable and it was tugging very tightly on her ears. She wouldn't wear it, knowing I had disposable ones on me. Might be an ok size for a toddler.<br />They're made of a satin like material. The color is pretty."
3.0,"My reason I purchased these was because I wanted long (tall) stretch pants, but they're barely long enough and if they shrink they'll be too short.  True tall would be about half an inch longer."
3.0,Pattern is beautiful.. shirt runs a bit small so I had to return it
3.0,"The 10x loupe was nicely packed however, not what I expected.<br /><br />10x for what I need is just OK.<br /><br />The size was very small and I was hoping for a loupe a bit larger in size and more powerful."
3.0,"These glasses are absolutely adorable and I wish I could get them in my prescription! They came well packaged with a case and cleaning cloth. I wanted a pair of blue light blocking glasses. When I held these up to the light, I didn‚Äôt see any difference in the way the light looked as I have with other blue light blocking lenses. I put them through a quick test of looking at certain colors. When a blue light blocking lens looks at the color blue, it should look grey (should blend in with the black circle pictured) and the red/cyan should blend in with the green on the color wheel photo.  As you can see, these lenses don‚Äôt show the colors altered at all. These lenses also produce a lot of glare as you can see my overhead lights reflecting in them.  I gave three stars for great frames and a cute shape, highly fashionable, but I can‚Äôt recommend these for blocking blue light at all."
3.0,Good choice but just a little short
3.0,"Pretty small for the size I ordered, especially in the neck. It's small enough there to be uncomfortable. But it's cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for"
3.0,"I love this dress, but after wearing it twice the colors started to run together around the armpits (not sweat stains, the black print turned the area grey). It's more of a cold-weather fabric anyway, so if you wear a cropped-length sweater over it then it's not a problem. I handwashed it before and after wearing."
3.0,Nice thick material but returning due to sizing.
3.0,"I'm giving it 3 stars because of the sizing. I usually wear a small. I'm 5'4&#34; 125 pounds. I ordered a size up, the tag says M/L and it's tiny. I would need a Lg/XL. But it is very supportive and not bad quality.  Just go up 2-3 sizes when buying."
3.0,Threads keep coming undone.  Like material
3.0,"either I suddenly became asymmetrical or the product was sewn together wrong.  each shoulder and sleeve is a different size. the right side is smaller than the left and the left pocket has a hole in it.<br /><br />it appears to be reasonably warm.  I would return it but it's not worth the hassle, people will just have to think I'm a gimp, no, not that kind, but gimpy looking, and it is not thick fleece as ad says.  The fleece in the sale might be thick, but not in the sweater"
3.0,"Nice casual throw on sweater. Definitely in the boxing side and thread is already pulling, but for the price it‚Äôs fine."
3.0,"I loved the look of these but, what becomes very irritating is nose placement part puts a lot of pressure on your nose and hurts after while they should start making that part for the nose with silicone, or some soft material that's less heavy on the nose part"
3.0,"Cute. Very cheap, but the adjustable clip works so so, and the peach design is nice. The stitching is sloppy, but you get what you pay for. All in all, not a bad buy!"
3.0,Not very breathable at all.
3.0,Initially great glasses.  With wear the lenses started to discolored
3.0,The outside of the bag looks great but the inside feels like a cheap  nylon. for 20 dollars its okay.
3.0,The print is nice but the fabric is very thin similar to leggings.  If you have any body excess anywhere this is a pass.
3.0,"I was surprised how thin this shirt was. It feels quite soft, but being so thin, it doesnt hold its shape. Will wear it around the house, but prefer a better fit when Im out. Feels like a very old, comfy tee shirt, like the ones we all have...."
3.0,These were a little loose. I purchased my usual size in leggings - small.
3.0,The front shade is too long that blocks your vision. You can barely see a distance of 3-4 feet in front within 45 degree angle. Not efficient for walking but you may enjoy it on water in a boat trip:)
3.0,I did not like that it was not white. The buttons were white against the off-white sweater. Somewhat disappointed.
3.0,Works ok. Good for backless/strapless needs but doesn‚Äôt really give any support. The adhesive isn‚Äôt very strong and I had to readjust a fair amount of times throughout the day.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:1f4804905bc0ff10c1d8bbf8b1e91627]] The delivery was very quick! Love that! The packaging was just a plastic wrap around the necklace, no box. The chain is very light weight and the gold is bright yellow. It look more expensive than what it feels. I think the silver would look better. Overall a nice necklace. I got a size 22‚Äô. Could have sized down honestly. I would suggest you buy it if you don't want to buy the real thing."
3.0,"Loved these sunglasses and so did my daughter. Planned to have them last through 2 kids and instead they have lasted 4 months üòî a screw fell out and either no other screw I have found works or the threads are stripped because every one I try just falls back out. So ag this point, the sunglasses are completely useless"
3.0,"Not very sturdy, but work okay for me."
3.0,"Not the best the band tends to fold under on me and the straps get longer then I almost fall out I do love the,color and convenience for nursing"
3.0,The skirt is SUPER long plus the waist doesn't fit<br />Had to give a friend
3.0,Soft but too tight in the waste. I had a csection so was looking for soft briefs that don‚Äôt irritate my scar. I probably needed a larger size but I still think it would be tight for someone who has a belly like me.
3.0,Fur on hood is small. For northern states it is not a winter  coat. I wear it at 48 or below.  It gets  to - 40 here. Would be great for Florida  winters when it gets cold.
3.0,Cute concept but was too small. I returned it.
3.0,"Maybe I'm a bit TOO curvy for it. It's cute and kinda fits but My boobs are too big and spill out.  For 2-piece sets, I probably need two different sizes."
3.0,"Well I bought because it looks cool, i didn't notice it had big fake diamonds on it but it still looks nice the little dangling cross looks great! only complaint I have is that the first time I put it on it came apart...I can fix it but it shows the craftsmanship isn't there. And the free gift was one of those chains they use at the banks so they don't get there pens stolen. All in all for the money not a bad purchase. I'll give them another shot! :)"
3.0,"Nicely weighted, it looks and feels like those $40 wrist bands.  Unfortunately 2 links to short fir my wrist and I got the largest they offered"
3.0,"Very hard to put on, but I think that is the point! Other than that they have helped!"
3.0,use as a handbag
3.0,Nice dress but it's kinda tight...
3.0,"Shirt is cute, but runs a little small. It is also very itchy where the design is. You have to wear a shirt underneath so you definitely want to go up a size for that reason alone."
3.0,"It's more for looks than function. This will not keep you very warm, and there was an  odor to it that won't seem to go away! I let it air out for a week, then sprayed it with fabreeze several times, but it still stinks. On the plus side it fits well, and looks just as good as the pictures."
3.0,"Just got it today. The size and thickness match description - no surprises there, however the label on the belt clearly states not &#34;Full Grain Leather&#34;, but just &#34;genuine leather&#34; - which is much lower grade.<br />The belt is also quite thin. Has already cracks in few places and does not inspire confidence in it's durability.<br />I guess you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I will try to update rating after half year or more"
3.0,"While this belt serves it's purpose, it is made rather cheaply.  I was not overly impressed, but for the price, it's not terrible."
3.0,"I didn‚Äôt have super high expectations for these leggings due to the price point, and won‚Äôt buy them again.<br /><br />Pros: they are soft and I like the colors.<br /><br />Cons: they don‚Äôt fit right in the crotch or where they hit my calves. I always feel like they aren‚Äôt pulled up high enough because the crotch is too low, even when the waist is where it should be. On the other hand, they are too tight around the leg seam (and I don‚Äôt have thick calves at all). They aren‚Äôt made from stretchy workout legging material, so I would be afraid they would stretch out if I wore them for more than just doing chores around the house."
3.0,they are so beautiful but the back broke after one wear!
3.0,I would recommend ordering a size larger. Fabric was nice.
3.0,I loved this swimsuit when I saw it but its very small and the top's cups are set very far apart.
3.0,"I am 5'-8"" and 125lbs. I normally wear a size small for shirts. I ordered the dark coffee color in Large color from reading other reviews to size up. I definitely recommend order two sizes up and more. Even in the large size, I felt restricted in the shoulder and the armpit region. The length was ok with the large but I could also go a size up there. There's lining at the front right down the center. The fabric material is soft and comfortable. I just wish it had a better fit and sizing overall."
3.0,"I bought this shirt in charcoal and liked it, so I purchased the light grey color. It fits TTS, but unfortunately after a couple washes (always in cold, then air dry), it started pilling all over. The bottom hem also often has strings hanging that have to be cut off."
3.0,"Cute as can be but was very small ,would have higher score if it fit. Was so disappointed. It would fit if there was no swim pants involved. So disappointed it was a birthday gift. Now I have nothing to give."
3.0,wife said it was smaller than expected but guess she should have paid more attention to dimensions.
3.0,Cute outfit. One of the buttons on the skirt is stitched very loosely so I had to tighten it.
3.0,Disappointed in this. It was for a birthday costume party. I only ordered it through an Amazon manager because what I originally ordered for the party was delayed and was not going to get here in time. This was the only thing that the manager could find that could be delivered in time. Its very cheaply made. The tail was not usable. The ears were ugly in person. Over all very disappointed in the poor quality of this product. Guess I will give it to one of the Grandkids to use for playtime.
3.0,Lace up back is a pain and the boning stuck out weird under the butt.  Ordered a teal green color and it was a teal blue which was pretty but if you're looking of green then that may not be what you get.  Front is OK.  If you have a belly you may look pregnant.
3.0,"The quality seemed good, but the length was too short, it kept pulling out of my pants and bunching up at the bottom.  Definitely not a good thing for a compression shirt."
3.0,Iv had another solitaire necklace that was more dainty and real looking. When I wear this layered with another necklace it looks better however you can tell it‚Äôs not real in my opinion.
3.0,I accidentally ordered two of this dress in the same size. In a way i'm glad I made that mistake because I got two completely different dresses with different tags on them in the same size. One of them is the dress pictured on the page but the other one is different with a mermaid ruffle bottom and that is not what I ordered nor does it match the description on the page or any of the pictures.
3.0,"Ped√≠ S, pero a√∫n as√≠ me qued√≥ muy ancha. Pero el color y la tela son bellos."
3.0,A hassle putting it on. Buttons kept unsnapping. A bit long but that was cool to keep pants dry.
3.0,Nice looking keychain but it fell apart quickly.
3.0,Returning due to inaccurate size<br />Good quality
3.0,"The prominent tag on the heel dug into my foot and caused a lot of discomfort the first time I wore them. Why do shoe manufacturers use those? I put in a sticky padded insole made for heels to cover the tag and now they are fine and I can wear them all day with minimal discomfort (the best I can get from just about any shoe given my sensitive feet). Note that the wedge is not cork, but is printed to look like cork."
3.0,"Cute dress, but runs way large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 120 lbs. 34D boobs, 27-28‚Äù waist and I wear a size 26/2. The size small is really big on me, even when I adjusted the straps tightly. It‚Äôs also quite long, to my mid calf. I‚Äôll probably return it. :/ Too bad, cause super cute idea."
3.0,"This backpack is really great and the fact that people are complaining about the gold on here is ridiculous. It‚Äôs clearly gold in the photos and if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it. The only issue I have with the bag is that it‚Äôs a half a size smaller than my other bag of the same brand. The zipper is also in a weird spot and it‚Äôs hard to reach into the bag. The zipper even scraped my hand up. It just doesn‚Äôt open up a lot but it‚Äôs cute."
3.0,Runs small! Bought one size larger and it‚Äôs still too small.
3.0,"I don't see how these are compression, I've worn compression boxers before and they're completely different. But they'll do the job working out."
3.0,"The design was very flattering and they pants were extremely comfortable. They fit perfectly but as I was putting them on (in two different colors) my dull and well manicured toe nail was able to easily cause RIPS in this fabric. It was so disappointing bc I love the design and comfort so much that I bought two pair... but I am now worried that if I was to wear them again and touch anything even the slightest bit sharp, it could leave me stranded with a very embarrassing situation. Yikes!!!"
3.0,"These bracelets are cute and shiny, but not worth the price. They are more in line with pre-teen party favors."
3.0,"So, I love the flared leg on these, which is why I ordered them! They seem like they are decent quality, but the waist runs pretty small, but the thigh area runs kind of big...so I guess I suggest if you decide to order, order a larger size? I wouldn't recommend."
3.0,Logo is not in the center of the shirt. Nice quality shirt though.
3.0,"for the price of it, the lining should be darker and have a smaller slid inside the bag."
3.0,Dress was very thin would be a good cover up for swimwear but too thin to wear alone.
3.0,"While these earrings were very cute, they kept getting snagged on things, way more than any other dangling earrings I‚Äôve ever had. In fact, on Christmas Day, the right earring snagged and pulled out, even with the back on it. I thought my ear would be bleeding but it was only red and I found the earring on the floor later."
3.0,"They're a bit thicker than I had anticipated - like the thickness of polyester skiing gloves. But they're very warm and the design is cute. The thickness of the fingers makes it kind of hard to type on my iPhone 6, so they're not the best tech gloves in the world. I've successfully been able to type with the thumbs but am having a hard time typing with the index or middle finger. Overall, I really like the gloves as they are both stylish and warm, and being able to type on my phone without taking them off is a bonus!"
3.0,It was pretty good
3.0,"Gorgeous, but sent medium vs large that I ordered, will jave to send back.  Also the lining is short, very short you will need to wear a slip if there wpuld be the chance that you may need to bend over."
3.0,"While the jacket is absolutely as beautiful and awesome as the pictures tell you, the sizing was absolutely wrong. I ordered so many sizes bigger than my own, and then gave up. :("
3.0,"These glasses did not look good on me at all.<br /><br />I ordered these glasses because in all of the pictures that were posted these glasses looked over sized and fun. These glasses did not fit over sized at all, I have a wide face and these just fit way too small for my face. Also the keyhole cut out was way out of proportion and just made these look awkward on. My boyfriend actually saw them and said those are awful where did you get those? When I tried them on for him he actually laughed and told me to just throw them away. Seeing as I did purchase these at a slight discount in exchange for a review I decided that I would give these to my friends 11 year old daughter, and while these do fit over sized on a kid they still don't look that great on her either.<br /><br />If you are on the fence because you have a wide face as well, don't bother these glasses will make you question everything you know about yourself."
3.0,Loved them even though my hair is thick they work out of my hair
3.0,Not so durable but very cute
3.0,"Much smaller then expected, quite dainty. Pretty, if thats what you were looking for. I bought this as a gift, and still gave it to my friend, she liked it a lot so that's what matters!"
3.0,I like the design. the vent take a way from the patch work on the side. All in all the shirt is as advertised.
3.0,So cute and warm but I guess it was dry rotten it fell apart
3.0,"It was alright. Not as stretchy as I like, so I returned it."
3.0,"I bought these to wear around the house. They‚Äôre comfortable and are great value for what I paid for. I don‚Äôt like the paddings on these though. They are thick and are positioned in an unflattering way. However, since I only wear them at home, I don‚Äôt mind too much."
3.0,Magnetic closure is very weak. Will not latch shut and stay
3.0,Much bigger than I‚Äôd like. Still pretty!
3.0,"The had does not provide sun protection for your ears or neck unless you have your back to the sun and the wind at the same time. Minimal coverage for the ears and the material flaps away when walking with or into the wind. There is nothing wrong with the hat per se, but it does not afford the protection I'm looking for."
3.0,"I really love the style and fit but they feel light, cheap and flimsy for the price. It came in fancy packaging"
3.0,Nice dress but I should have gone with a medium.  I ordered based on previous reviews. It's an elegant dress!!
3.0,Nice looking but the pendants keep falling off not sure why.
3.0,"This is a nice knit poncho with grey and white stripes, but it is going to be like a bib on my niece, who is tall and thin. I will give this to a shorter friend and get my niece something else."
3.0,"Poor sewing quality at some parts. I like the color. I bought one large size, but I think it's larger than I expected. It's comfy, but looks cheaper."
3.0,"No white and black like I expected, They‚Äôre more like tan and black.."
3.0,They ran small!
3.0,The lace is really pretty however the tanks are oddly long and are super tight in the armpits.
3.0,"Beautiful dress. However, if you are a ‚ÄúD‚Äù cup woman, the dress will be too snug. I ordered an XL, and usually wear a ‚ÄúL‚Äù sized shirt."
3.0,Looks like the pictures. When I got it the dangling price at the bottom front was disconnected.
3.0,"The pictures look good, but the fit is off. I ordered a size XL and I am usually a US Medium; 150lbs 34D 5'6&quot;. It was still pulling a lot on the back which makes my body look dumb from the side. The front is cute, there is light padding and the way the swimsuit pulls together will keep you lifted!<br /><br />I will be returning this suit as I would feel self-conscious from the side angle lol.<br /><br />Also the white color looks so much more vibrant in the Amazon ad than in real life."
3.0,"I bought this product so that it could help me sweat while working out and doing every day tasks so I can lose weight, etc..  somehow the material this product was made with made me break out, itch.. Poor quality, doesn‚Äôt do what it‚Äôs intended to do!"
3.0,It's ok. The tapers are too long and uncomfortable to sleep in. Thankfully I only wore for a day or two. The metal tunnels are too blunt. Hurts when I sleep on them. Cool color but not comfortable. Also the rubber bands suck and fall off the tapers pretty much right away.
3.0,"Its super thin and not made very well.  The straps are uneven, but all in all, it's not too bad. I might keep it."
3.0,"These fit fine in the length and waist but they are simply too skinnny...really tight and for those that have developed calf muscles - forget it. Won't work without cutting off the blood supply to your feet and ankles. I give these a neutral rating since may work for some but be aware that skinnny means really really skin tight,"
3.0,This ran so very large in the blousing of the top -- I really wanted to love it for all the other features. It's a gorgeous deep ink royal blue and the sleeves are so stylish and comfortable. The skirt part of the dress fit wonderfully and is true to the size chart... the length was perfect. But the top of the dress just has too much fabric. The fabric was even wonderful. Felt like a high-end slip dress! I so wish the cut of the top of the dress had been proportionate.
3.0,Pic of hood makes it look long but it's actually short..
3.0,"It's a nice looking pin from the front, but had some chipped spots on the sides and back. (See pictures)"
3.0,Pros: I love the gray Paisley pattern on the masks I ordered!  Comfortable smooth material<br /><br />Cons: with how smooth and tight the material is the mask kept slipping down below my nose and I had to keep adjusting.  My glasses fogged up a lot more with these than they did with other gaiters.  Not sure if it's because of the material or something else.<br /><br />Overall I really love the look and comfort of these gaiters but unfortunately I won't be wearing them nearly as much as my others because of above cons.
3.0,"OKAY, the description is a little off.  This is like a pair of soft fluffy socks.  If you have a bump a lump... it will show. Now I plan to keep it and I plan for it to be a weekend pull on skirt with a tunic that I just happen to have that it will work perfectly with."
3.0,"This skirt needs pressing after washing, the hem turns up and is difficult to get pressed down.<br />The fabric looks like a good quality, a good weight.  The color goes with nothing in my closet,<br /> if I were to compare it with a Crayola crayon, I would call it Prussian Blue."
3.0,Headband was very tight and the feathers were much less than in pic
3.0,These were alright. Larger than I thought they would be but the quality seems good. The price was good enough I didn't see sending them back. Plan on leaving them in the car as a back up pair.
3.0,Wonderful thick material! They ride alllll the waaaaay up to just under butt cheek. Only issue is the small ‚Äúone string‚Äù that acts in place of a band that would work around the top thigh to hold in place is extremely small giving an obvious as hell indent on inner and outer thighs.
3.0,"Very cute and soft but not really good for kids up to 8, very tight on my 7yo daughter who has a normal size head. Would think 5 or less."
3.0,The arm length fits like it is a 3/4 quarter sleeve sweatshirt.  Not great quality but cute enough for the fun gift
3.0,"BUT probably over priced. Found just about the same ones at the Dollar Tree... They weren't as cute, but still just as cheaply made. Using them for a St. Pattie's Day mini session and they'll do."
3.0,I had to cut out the slip just as other customers had suggested in reviews. Other than that it's a cute skirt. Definitely need something underneath as it is sheer.
3.0,Love the brand but they need pockets.
3.0,Good enough product. You get what you pay for. First pair of glasses broke after two days of wearing them
3.0,Great quality but the size is a little small especially on the arms
3.0,"These are kind of funny shaped for the heel, like they're not long enough or shaped to go over the curve. They don't stay on well because of it. They are functional, though, just annoying to keep adjusting."
3.0,"The material is like that cheap Halloween costume material, but i kept it because i like the shape of the shirt.<br />another thing, the back is so long, i keep getting stuck on things i walk passed ((like computer chairs at work) LOL!"
3.0,They are beautiful but too small :/
3.0,"SIZING! &#34;For belts with numeric sizes, order one size larger than pants waist size. (32&#34; waist takes a 34&#34; belt.)&#34; Per the sizing chart. I wear a 36&#34; pant and this 45&#34; would work, but just barely. Also I dont know if I was originally the wrong size or if they are short as other have reviewed, but it was 43&#34; from end of the D rings to tip. The third picture on this item shows what size belt to use for what size pants. It's way MORE accurate. I'll be ordering a Large now. I'll update the review at that time."
3.0,Zipper came apart
3.0,Doesnt quite look like the picture but its at least comfortable...
3.0,"The purse is nice, good quality, but the two shoulder straps are too short. They‚Äôre adjustable, but still too short. I added holes, to make the two straps longer ... but it‚Äôs still not a comfortable length. In addition, the purse is bigger than I would like it. I like that it has an additional cross body strap ... but I prefer to use the two short straps (which are two short)."
3.0,"Great looking. Glasses were delivered with twisted frame. Not sure what to do because this was the last pair from seller. Hope this gets manufactures attention, I would order another pair."
3.0,"It‚Äôs nice, comfortable, color as described. Stretchy & doesn‚Äôt make you sweat. I do like the material. It‚Äôs held up well. But what I don‚Äôt like is that you have to adjust it everyday because it loosens throughout the day.  It‚Äôs also very wide. Overall good for the money."
3.0,Very pretty but broke almost immediately after opening
3.0,Build quality and look is amazing. But they didn't fit in my trucks remote key
3.0,"The tye dye is nice on back of night shirt, but almost non existing on the front. Front has very little color."
3.0,I love the color of these slippers and the furry lining is very soft. The slippers would be much more comfortable if there was some padding in the soles.
3.0,They are running a little small and a little short for me. I ordered XL and there is no stretch in them and they only come to my ankle. Will not order them again
3.0,"I ordered up a couple sizes so that fit was okay, but the material where the ties go were uneven and thin material that would not have lasted."
3.0,Closing the bar in the slot is very difficult to find and insert without a great deal of pressure.
3.0,was a lot bigger than I expected I cant keep this on my head if I tried but its pretty
3.0,If I order a new watch I would appreciate receiving a new one. The watch I received had scratches and residue on the face and lint inside the crevices of the watch. I am not complaining because honestly I love this watch. I doesn‚Äôt not have to be $200 to be nice. This is among my favorite watches ever. The swirls are kind of mesmerizing. Great buy. Very slick professional watch!
3.0,It is very tight and I ordered it a size bigger than what I wear. It takes two people to lip it up.
3.0,not a big fan of plastic snap style adjuster on back
3.0,This hat is nice and thick but runs small.
3.0,"Don't use this when there is just a bit of wind.  Not sturdy.  Sorry I bought it, will purchase a canopy instead."
3.0,Looked awesome from afar but was falling apart when I took out of box. Returned.
3.0,The ratcheting system was not included...
3.0,I love the color but it fades quick now it looks dingy after a few wears
3.0,These socks look very pretty and I like the rubber on the inside to keep them on but they ripped within the first few uses.
3.0,"this chain was super long. when adjusted to the length i wanted it, the chain left over was so long it hung half way down my back and was uncomfortable. sent it back and got a full refund"
3.0,"Nice bag, but cell phone compartment too small. Can't zip bag closed when phone is in pocket. No compartment for keys etc. Disappointed but will use for awhile."
3.0,"Very shiny jacket.  It isn't really worth it in my opinion, but if you are in a jam and can't find a brick and mortar store to get one, this will get it done."
3.0,"Nice shirt, comfy to wear, runs a tad bit small. (I will be handing this over to my 12 year old) I just wish I could find items that fit like the photos online. Love the style of this shirt, i just wish it fit me correctly. I received this in XXXL I am a US size 12 and this does not fit me like i think it should. I wish it was a little bigger in the tummy area and a tad bit longer.<br /><br />Type:tops Size Information: Asia size, not US size<br />DETAIL SIZE OF THIS DESIGN(1cm=0.39inch)<br />S; Bust 84cm/33&#34; --Sleeve 27cm/10.6&#34; --Length 71cm/27.9&#34;<br />M; Bust 88cm/34.6&#34; --Sleeve 28cm/11&#34; --Length 72cm/28.3&#34;<br />L; Bust 92cm/36.2&#34; --Sleeve 29cm/11,4&#34; --Length 73cm/28.7&#34;<br />XL; Bust 96cm/37.8&#34; Sleeve-- 30cm/11,8&#34; --Length 74cm/29.1&#34;<br />2XL; Bust 100cm/39.3&#34; --Sleeve 31cm/12.2&#34;-- Length 75cm/29.5&#34;<br />3XL; Bust 104cm/40.9&#34;-- Sleeve 32cm/12.6&#34; --Length 76cm/29.9&#34;<br /><br />I received this item at a discount  in exchange for my honest  review. This had no effect on my opinion of this product, and i would have said the same thing if I had paid full price."
3.0,Too small around the neck.
3.0,The dress fit amazing. However it was the smell for me! I could've washed it and I guess wore it. But I decided to return it. It smelled like fish. HORRIBLE SMELL
3.0,"I wanted  a clear purse for ballgames, just big enough for a water bottle and my phone.  The large in this is perfect.  But the strap is too stiff and I can't smooth it out to adjust.  I've never had an unmanageable strap like this."
3.0,Not as well made but that's expected for the price. The little &#34;loop&#34; used to connect the nose ring to the chain was thin and flimsy and just hastily pinched it together. not glued. not welded. The nose ring was pretty enough for me to over look it. If you want the chain to have some slack and hang then this is not the right length for that.
3.0,"This is not my favorite scarf...in fact, I am a little disappointed in the scarf. It has a big logo and brand name embroidered on it (kinda makes it look cheap in my opinion), it sheds black fibers all over my coats, it is only 30% alpaca and 70% acrylic, it is not nearly as soft as my other alpaca scarf, all of the edges have a whip stich on the outside (I can only assume this is to keep it from unraveling)?? I have another alpaca scarf and it is not stitched on the outsides?!?! Anyway, you get the picture...I don't mean to make it sound like a terrible scarf, it's a fine scarf, just not for me. I appreciate that I was given the opportunity to purchase this scarf at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, its just not for me."
3.0,Material is a little on the cheap side.  Fit is a little smaller than average US sizing.
3.0,The color band over the cord wears off quickly.
3.0,Great concept. My 5 year old wasn‚Äôt interested
3.0,"cute.  runs a little big around, but the shoulders are on point.  I'll take it in and it will fit nicely, but that is a hassle."
3.0,"My wife bought several different body suits and they all seem to run a tad on the small side she said.<br />She did like the material, but since sha has a bit of a longer torso, the fit was a bit off, she wishes that the manufacturers would realize that some women have longer torsos than others and they would design close to fit for longer torso'd women."
3.0,"One shoe little  smaller  than  other ,  but I used the stretch  tool"
3.0,"Its a very cute suit, and exactly as the picture shows, but you must have the perfect shape of body to fit it properly. I got an XL and suit's top and bottoms fit perfectly, but the way the colored sections were sown on, it made me look bigger around the middle, like I was pregnant."
3.0,"I ordered up a size but very tight in the shoulder area , not comfortable and the material is very hot once you put it on , it doesn‚Äôt breathe at all."
3.0,Great value...but sadly to large for my face.
3.0,"The dress arrived with a stain on it.  I was leaving for vacation, so I tried washing it hoping it would come out.  Unfortunately it didn't.  I washed in cold due to other reviews on how it shrinks.  Didn't dry it.  Stain didn't come out and the dress shrunk anyway.  If there wasn't a stain and din't shrink, I would give it a higher score.  Will say its a great dress for the price and very comfortable.  Sad though that I couldn't wear it in public."
3.0,"I like the dress, it is pretty and it fits me very good, it is just that the material makes me feel hot during the summer."
3.0,"The shirt is cute and soft, but even at two sizes larger, it's almost like a crop top. Not tight, just short. The sorts were also kinda of weird- were boxy around the crotch area, like it rely like they were on backwards (tried them on both ways just to double check!). If you aren't worried about the shirt or short length, a size or two up should work for you."
3.0,"Works great, hole cut out for one way valve cut to big"
3.0,"I guess it depends on how you are build. I ordered medium and they were really tight, I ordered Large and they were really long."
3.0,This one did not work for me. The fabric was nice and I loved the style. It was just not the right look for me. So I returned it. But is is of really good quality.
3.0,These were very large and the glitter was not what i was expecting. I know this style is on trend but the glitter from these looked cheap.
3.0,"Huge, hard to put in. I'll still wear it, but only with the right outfit I guess"
3.0,Loved them! Super cute. Slightly heavy after wearing a while. Would have been nice though if I got the colors displayed. I received 2 green and 1 gold.
3.0,"I really like the look and feel of this product, however I only bought this two months ago and some of the lace beneath the embroidered panel is already ripping.  The six holes are small and spread out far enough that the garment is still wearable, not sure how much longer that will last."
3.0,"i am on a diet anyway, so it will eventually fit. i wanted it to fit Now tho"
3.0,My baby girl is currently fitting in 18m clothes so I I ordered the 12-18M size and it was way too big! Luckily I just needed it for her 12 month pictures so I just sat her down and used a safety pin so pull it back a bit. We have the whole summer to let her grow into it so I'm not worried. Still super cute!
3.0,"3 stars because it Looks nothing like the picture! It doesn't look like real hair like the picture suggest but It is an OK wig for the price. I bought it for my teenage daughter who dresses up as Elsa for birthday parties. It fits her head nicely and works for what we need it for. It came nicely packaged, in fact, I still store it in that packaging when not using it."
3.0,They are smaller than expected but decent for the price
3.0,"It looks OK from a distance and the color is accurate to the picture, but there's not much else good I can say about this band. The ""fabric"" feels very cheap and plasticy and unlike what you would expect fabric to feel like. In putting it on, the band is stiff and not very flexible. It was not as easy as it should have been to buckle it, which gives me reservations that I don't think this one will hold up for long. I guess for $8 I should not have expected much more, but I recommend anyone expecting a fabric band to feel and respond like fabric to look elsewhere.<br /><br />EDIT 10/8/20: So it's been over two months and the band is holding up with occasional wear. My initial durability fears have faded, so I am increasing my rating from 2 stars to 3. Although the band did feel less stiff over time, it still has the feel of a mixture of paper and plastic and not fabric. Clearly it's made of a strong material, but don't expect a fabric-feel. I still wear it occasionally because it looks good and it's feel is not irritating."
3.0,Consider ... these are shorter than quarter-cut ankle socks ... they do not resemble the image being shown here and they're calling it a &#34;low cut quarter ankle sock&#34; -- they are in fact a very low ankle sock. The word quarter leant seem appropriate in my experience and expectation. They're quite thin but very comfortable. Will report back on durability. Disregard the image and picture a very low-cut ankle sock. I kind of like them despite being cut too short for a quarter ankle. The material feels great. Second time in two weeks I've been duped by product photos on Amazon.
3.0,Everyone thought I was a mouse.
3.0,"This is exactly as picture shows the color and the edges that are not in one straight line.I did not pay attention to that details. It fits in terms of size(S) However, the length is more like a dress than a tank top! which was a bit disappointing for me. But I will keep it since the seller packaging was good with a nice motivational note to the customer. The price is very good."
3.0,These earrings are really cute but the post that‚Äôs supposed to go through the ear is way too thick to go through a child‚Äôs ear. I have to return them because I don‚Äôt want to stretch out her earring hole.
3.0,fine looking but a little tight
3.0,"The dress material is great! Looks professional and has a great flexibility/stretch. However, I have an A cup so the neckline looked wild on me. Since there is not much horizontal surface area to flatten out the neckline, the collar bone area stuck up. If you‚Äôre bustier than me, not hard to do, you will probably like this dress."
3.0,I wore it 3 times and the wires came out ü§¨
3.0,Loved the tapers but the gauges it came with hurt my ears
3.0,The knot on top is off center so it looks wonky. The color is definitely not the pretty lapis shown in the pics. It has a good heft to it. I don‚Äôt care for thr shiny black cord either. Overall I wouldn‚Äôt order this particular stone again.
3.0,"I wish the inside was a cloth liner it appears to be vinyl that will not last long.  Also the straps are not very long, its an arm purse not really shoulder carrying."
3.0,Can‚Äôt see when I have the hood over my head. No pockets or thumb tie. Ordered a better one and this one is my back up.
3.0,Mm esta bien solo que para medir todo tienen que preguntar primero la estatura el color de piel ( por si es correcto que sea de tu color que conbine)
3.0,"This is a very cute, stylish dress. But, the sizing send very off, way too large. We ended up returning it."
3.0,"Color is off.  I thought it was cotton. Or, had some cotton in it. It doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt like it for me."
3.0,"The gown is very soft and long in length (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù), but is smaller than expected. I actually purchased this for my daughter, but it didn‚Äôt fit her. I decided to keep it for myself, rather than returning."
3.0,"These pants didn't fit as shown on the model.  The elastic part went to my hips and bunched out making me look like i had a diaper on.  Fabric was like scratchy stiff linen and i felt an awkward pulling in the crotch when walking.  Buttons were cute.  got a Medium.  4""11 112 lbs.  returning"
3.0,Way bigger than expected. I think it is a men‚Äôs size.
3.0,cute shoes but very heavy. My daughter is two and a half and is in a size 10 shoe. They are heavy on her feet. Very cute otherwise
3.0,"While my son loves these, they definitely run small, possibly shrink a little as well and are not the greatest quality. They would be good for summer use only but since they do not go up very high on the ankles be careful about getting blisters when wearing these with shoes."
3.0,This is clearly an imitation to to original. But it‚Äôs less than half the price so what do you expect. Material is lighter but seems good and comes close in design guess it will get pass who doesn‚Äôt know the difference
3.0,"I bought these for running. The fit is good for small faces.  They do fog up in hot and humid weather because they fit really close to my face (bottoms touch my cheeks).  The main thing that takes some getting  used to is the darkness of the lenses.  It needs to be really sunny for these to feel okay.  If it's only slightly bright, then I feel like I can't see, and I definitely cannot drive in them.  However, the price is good and if I lose them, it is no big deal.  Just fair warning on how dark they are."
3.0,Top portion ( bra portion) kept coming up
3.0,This was too small for my daughter & not worth paying the shipping to send it back. So I gave it to my 6yr old granddaughter to play dress up in & it's only a tiny bit too big for her & it's supposed to be a women's 2X.
3.0,"Just plastic, not &#34;pearl&#34;.  Did not expect actual pearls, but something pearlized from description.  For the price it is ok.  Will be fun to wear."
3.0,"I love the way these socks have the ‚Äústicky‚Äù strips all around the opening of the sock as well and some at the ball of the foot because the inside of shoes can sometimes be slippery and cause blisters. I got them for my Keds i ordered and they are great. They are also perfect for Toms. I wear an 8.5 typically for reference on how much the sock shows or not. My only complaint is the stitching. Out of the six pairs of socks, only two pairs looked like they were sturdy. The other ones looked like they were stitched too fast and not enough tension, so I am afraid they won‚Äôt hold up as long."
3.0,I actually like these pants--they're nice and stretchy and they fit well but the zipper on the back pocket broke 20 minutes after I first put them on and that belt that comes with them is pretty useless.
3.0,Nice watch at low price. The light feature is not bright enough to clearly read the time in the dark.
3.0,"I love the shoes, but they were too tight."
3.0,exercise
3.0,the gold anklets are bigger than the silver ones. i wore a silver one and it came off within an hour but the gold ones hold up better. they do tarnish though
3.0,"Reasonably warm, but the fingers are to short for my hands...They only draw down about 3/4 of the finger, plus the liner tends to pull out of the outer knit layer if you are not very carful removing them from your hands"
3.0,Light weight. Fits filters
3.0,"This product runs big, so the arch support is not really valuable."
3.0,"I bought large originally and they were too small, so I ordered extra large.  The only difference between the large and extra large is the size tag...one says 'large' and the other says 'extra large'.  I compared them next to each other....n size difference."
3.0,The tiny pins came out after 3 weeks...jeweler had to repair.<br />Now the watch is terrific!
3.0,"What I like about the top are the pattern and colors (I got the pink one).  It runs large so if you like a fitted top, size down.  I definitely have to tuck it in.  It's not as fine and flowy of a material as I'd hoped, and the fit, especially in the armpit area, is pretty boxy and stiff.  I almost felt like I was wearing scrubs when I tried it on.  After pre-washing and using my steamer, it relaxed a bit and looked better.  The overall quality of material and design is below average, but the sewing is decent, no loose or crooked seams.  It's not the star of my closet but I'll wear it under a light jacket or cardigan."
3.0,"I don't like that the straps are to long, not a good fit. Will not purchase again m"
3.0,I ordered a small and it is enormous. A S is more like a medium.
3.0,The hat looks good- my only complaint is that there is nothing in the cap part that acts as support and keeps the hat standing upright when not being worn (the hat is floppy even when worn). The design is great but it fits a little weird. I also was not impressed with the flatness of the bill.
3.0,No es lo que esperaba .
3.0,This was good though the rope for the cross was much bigger than the other ropes so it didn't sit right on my wrist.
3.0,This is BEAUTIFUL. It seems well made and sturdy. But I can‚Äôt seem to get it snug enough that my watch doesn‚Äôt keep resetting after every use.
3.0,Cute but very very thin looks thicker and softer in picture<br />Not as expected
3.0,I like it just what I wanted till I go in 5 feet water. It was suppose to be water resistant up to 20 feet. Now I have to shake it to work. The winder do not work anymore.
3.0,"The socks themselves seem fine, but they are more like thigh highs for my size 5'2 frame."
3.0,"These are comfortable but they are very, very thin. The photo makes them look thicker than they are. They'd be great for summer time when you don't want to wear super thick socks. They seem true to size and may possibly even fit someone who wears a 9.5 - 10 in women's. I highly doubt it would fit a men's 8 - 11, which would be about a 11 - 13 in women's.<br /><br />My feet don't feel restricted and after wearing them for a few hours, the part around my ankle didn't leave imprints from the elastic. As for the ""arch support"" I don't notice anything special about it. The middle part of the sock with the ridges does feel a smidgen tighter than the rest of the sock but it's not uncomfortable and definitely not strong enough to provide any sort of arch support. The material isn't super soft but it's not rough and it won't leave little sock balls in your shoes / on your feet after you've worn them for awhile. The seam on the toe doesn't bother me as it's very low profile.. I can't feel it rub against my toes at all. Since they're rather thin, I don't expect these socks to last long.<br /><br />Overall, if you're buying it just to have a breathable pair of socks these would be great. If you're looking for high quality sock with true arch support, you won't find it here."
3.0,BBQ rotisserie device missing tho advertised; grill itself is nice.
3.0,Even Though I Wash Clothes That I Buy It Should Not Be Dirty Like This But Other Than That My Son Loves His Outfit & Ready For His Sonic Bday Party Soon.
3.0,See above. Need to return
3.0,Too wide.  I don't like how it looks on my wrist.  Like the smaller width better.
3.0,Okay - a bit bulky
3.0,The fabric is not soft. I feel uncomfortable & hot when wearing it
3.0,"I wanted to love it. It‚Äôs soft and has a lot of stretch but it was actually too large for me in a medium (5ft, 145lbs) and the chest area was way too short. Had it fit, I would have purchased them all. Small would have fit better but no saving the chest space. Size down."
3.0,May order some more colors.
3.0,"I am giving it three stars because it did the job for me. I just wanted to see how a nose piercing would look before taking the plunge with a real one. It does look real when it's on and it's very cute, not too large for the nose. But the magnet is weak and any sneeze or brush on your nose will knock it off. You are guaranteed to lose it so I wouldn't purchase it for any other reason but to see what you'd look like with a nose piercing."
3.0,It's see-through.. more like a lingerie. can't wear it in public
3.0,thiner material than what i expected
3.0,Good quality. Warm.
3.0,"The glasses are great. However, I only received 3 of the 4 pairs of glasses."
3.0,"Way, WAAAY to big! Pretty design. Material is very slick and held onto wrinkles like crazy. Had to return."
3.0,"Cute and comfy band for my watch, however the hook and loop closure is already worn out and has to be refastened multiple times a day."
3.0,"I got many compliments on the look of this coat but the sleeves are a little short and several of the buttons fell off the first time I wore it. I still wear the coat but it was embarrassing everyone saying ""there goes another button"" etc."
3.0,"They are too small, as I have been weared I can walk all day long with them."
3.0,I'm not a huge fan. I have curves and this fit pretty snug. I don't think I will wear it too much :-(
3.0,"It was nice material. But too large. I am 5""2' and 110lbs and the small was too large"
3.0,Love the items but sizing is waaaaaaay to small!
3.0,Charms are eye catchers! But the glue doesn't hold up well. The charms fall right off of the base. Not made well!
3.0,for a smaller head
3.0,Colors were different than in the picture. Arrives on time and is decent quality for the price.
3.0,It's fine but within 2 weeks there were holes in the pockets that I barely used.
3.0,Way too small!  Size not true to size!
3.0,My daughter loves them but the sizes come either too small or too big. Had to return the small size bit the next size is too big. We just kept the too big size
3.0,I order this for my dad for a vacation we re going on. He tried them on and they were a perfect fit. The only complaint he had was that his feet were hurting after walking for a little bit. I dint know if this is because the shoe doesn't have much of an insole or because he normally doesn't walk that much lol. But I think this is a really good product for the price and if anything you can put an insert in the shoe.
3.0,Look and feel cheaply made. Frames feel like they could break easily.
3.0,"The watch is okay.  Interestingly, i pulled off the protective plastic on the watch face glass? covering and almost pulled it out of the watch.  Also the crown is not as precise as it could be - it doesn‚Äôt make a noticeable click when it gets into the correct position for time adjustment or date change.  Overall, an okay watch and good conversation starter!!!"
3.0,"Cute and functional, but broke on the 4th day of wear. Not durable. :("
3.0,"The description said the dress was linen. It is not. I am keeping the dress., but was disappointed. I like the color and the length."
3.0,Not really working
3.0,"Purchased these after getting my piercing re-done after 4 years.  Not remembering what kind of jewelry I was needing I just purchased blindly.  I'm sad to say that these seem much smaller than advertised.  It would not fit completely through my lip.  The sizing seems very small although the packaging was great.<br /><br />Probably my error and not so much the seller; however, be aware that there are different sizes."
3.0,Beautiful bras but run small
3.0,I got an xxl and the bodysuit was still very tight i'd be cautious if this product. The buttons on the belt are cheaply made it fell off as soon as i tried it on. This isn't worth the money
3.0,Different amount. Only 6 not 10 as stated
3.0,Missing a black earing from the pair
3.0,Turned green after a while
3.0,I‚Äôm a curvy woman so I ordered a L but it was way too tight. It fit snug on my 13 year old.
3.0,These socks are thinner than I expected. Not sure how they will hold up over time. First wash was inside out and let them dry on a rack. They are warmer than cotton socks.
3.0,"Gift, small"
3.0,"Runs a little small, seems cheap but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"They definitely run small. I normally wear 7 1/2 sneakers and have to go up to size 8 for heels. First pair I ordered was size 8, and it felt like I could squeeze only a few toes in the shoe itself. I returned that pair and got a 9 (they don't seem to have half sizes). That seems to fit pretty well.<br /><br />I have some trouble figuring out what's the best way to get them on and off with the  spats. I think I just have to totally undo the corset every time, which is a bit annoying. But they look so cute.<br /><br />The shoes feels pretty stiff/hard, hopefully they won't be uncomfortable. I definitely will have to wear a thin sock with them when wearing the spats, the material wanted to stick to my bare skin when trying them on."
3.0,It protects but it fogs up easily.  Not good for sports.
3.0,"A lot smaller than I had expected and the first 3 that I tried to use broke, but for the price they worked"
3.0,"Larger than expected, but cute. A bit pricey for the quality."
3.0,I would give this 5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for the chemical smell.  I‚Äôve left this unzipped and propped open outside for 2 days now and the smell has barely dissipated. I really like everything else about it.  Hoping a few more days & nights outside will help.
3.0,Beautiful but didn‚Äôt last
3.0,Two things. First: we received it in a clear package with an address label on it. This might not bother some people but it bothered me. Second: I took it out of the package and there‚Äôs button sized stains on the front of it. I‚Äôll be sending it back.
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, but after reading other reviews, I ordered a large. I'm glad I did, they fit snugly. However, they are very long on me. When I pull the leg all the way down, the bottom comes about halfway on my feet.  I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh about 138 pounds.  I bought these on a deal and only paid $7.99, so I'll keep them, but if I spent much more, I would be disappointed."
3.0,Cute shirt.  Wore a couple of times.  Held color well so far but material seems to be ‚Äúpilling‚Äù or not holding up well.  Lightweight and great for my son‚Äôs ball games.
3.0,Sleeves a little to long
3.0,This is not Jean material its color Jean fabric other then that is good to go.....
3.0,These socks are great for toddlers with small feet. My son wears size 6 shoe and these socks got too tight after first wash.
3.0,"I wore these for my wedding for a little over 9 hours. While they were beautiful and did not bother me while I was wearing them, when I took them off, my earlobes were bright red, indented where the earrings sat and throbbing with pain. The pain continued for 2 days."
3.0,Great look and design but as others mention the lenses are very dark. Difficult to see when coming into the house or in a shaded area.  If they were a little bettter in that respect I would give it 4 or 5 stars!
3.0,"I loved this ring. However it only lasted a week before it broke. Also turned my finger quite green, which I kind of expected."
3.0,"Good price on a funny tee with a female cut. I liked the lighter weight for summer and v-neck. However, after a few washings, it has noticeably shrunk. It would fit my teen niece. I'm disappointed."
3.0,"These are really really thick socks.  Like the equivalent of men's boot work socks.  Good if that's what you are looking for, bad if you wanted regular socks."
3.0,I ordered this for my son. He's into the whole shark phase right now. The price was reasonable. I received the package in the mail. Its pretty light which is convinient. The material isn't the best though. A piece of spring fell off and the necklace broke a few minutes after putting it on. My husband tightened the piece so he gets to wear it. Decent product for its price.
3.0,There wasn‚Äôt much shine or prettiness to them just looked cheap
3.0,Fair quality. Returned dress
3.0,These are super cute earrings but they were broken when they arrived. Luckily I had a glue gun and was able to glue the posts to the earrings but would have been better to get them in tact.
3.0,"Its a bit small and the slit on the side goes right in the middle of not above my side rib if that makes sense. So to my bra almost. The fabric is nice it‚Äôs almost like a dri fit material feel. It looks like after a few washes it will mess up.. also maybe even shrink.. we will see how it holds up.. 5‚Äô8, 185lbs, L"
3.0,I would like a full refund please. I will reach out to the seller. This is not a good buy. Fabric crushes as well.
3.0,"I like the look but thought they would be more fitted and a bit longer. They are very comfortable, but I ordered them a size smaller because I like my briefs very fitted, but these I assume are made larger. I wear an XL but always wear a Large, but seems if I order from here in the future, I may need to go to  Medium to get the fit I want."
3.0,Some didnt close right!
3.0,"The biggest bun is HUGE perfect I suppose for long thick hair, thin though not so much. The other ones are fairly strong and work perfect!"
3.0,"As the title states the glasses are great for sun protection, (I got the green ones) but the glasses themselves slip a lot and end up all crooked and wonky. They weigh my own glasses down to where I'm having to constantly push them up. But they are a lot better than layering big sunglasses ontop of your own."
3.0,"Typically never picky for a shirt I would use for casual wear and working out but this shirt just fit wayyy too snug for a medium. I have an athletic build, 5'7 but I can't get myself to wear skin tight shirts anymore which is what I received. The quality is decent but the graphic is so awesome. I decided to give this away to my sister who is smaller yet a huge cobra kai fan and I'll be ordering a large soon since I liked it that much."
3.0,This is very comfortable but it's very big so anybody that's size two or 4 get an extra small it's very comfy the picture is exactly what it looks like but it is very large so if you are petite definitely get an extra small I'm exchanging mine for a smaller size but I do love it
3.0,smaller than I (or my daughter) was hoping for
3.0,"Fit my waist, but has no elasticity so falls down easily-but the lace thigh part was small with no stretch, creating a small bulge on my thigh. I ordered an XL, Waist is 37 I usually wear 13-15 pants."
3.0,"These leggings are soft and comfortable but paper-thin. The material is mediocre, already pilling after wearing for a few hours. I will not purchase again."
3.0,The design is beautiful.
3.0,"This outfit is sized more for a 3 year old than 12 month old (which is the size I purchased).  Other than that, cute and worth the ten bucks."
3.0,"Nice belt, but show signs of wear and tear quickly."
3.0,"The stitching on the silver case is a bit amateurish. The black one is much cleaner, neater, and quality looking. Also why does this one have that extra metal piece on the outside? The black version doesn't. I much prefer the detailing on the black case."
3.0,This dress is nice in theory but I did not like the paper like material and how it fell wildly low cut in the chest area. I was looking forward to wearing this dress but it failed to reach my expectations.
3.0,Sizing matched up with my chest size but can't get it up past my elbow. Sleeves are very tight and material does not stretch at all.
3.0,This belt looks nice in the picture but the quality is not as good as it say. The ‚Äúleather‚Äù is more like strong plastic.  Don‚Äôt waste your money unless you want a belt  just for a few days.
3.0,Warm and soft but color was not as pictured. More of a purple tone than grey and i can tell if you have big hands these wouldnt fit. Luckily i have small hands
3.0,"This belt has a chemical dye smell, to the point you can‚Äôt even smell the leather undertone. My son has hand crafted leather and his dye doesn‚Äôt smell this harsh. Which means the leather wasn‚Äôt surfaced dyed, but the leather was immersed on the dye. Even days later after airing I can still smell the dye.<br />It does have a nice casual elegance style. It comes in a nice storage pouch. This is why I am giving it three stars despite the dye smell."
3.0,"I like the way it looks and how easy it is to put on and take off, however, the magnetic closure tents to slide and I have to adjust it frequently."
3.0,They fit a little awkward.  Fun though.
3.0,"Product color is much darker than it is in the picture.  It is a mocha brown.  Also arrived with a hole in the pocket.  BUYER BEWARE - if you need to return it, seller does not pay for the return shipping."
3.0,Back is loose so that it slips off sometimes.
3.0,"Fit was great and as expected. However, it‚Äôs headlined as padded and I expect ‚Äúpadded‚Äù to mean it provides a bit more support or push up. They simply stuck a flimsy, extremely thin piece of fabric between the lining."
3.0,"When I first opened up this dress I had a feeling I was going to be pretty disappointed. The material just does not feel like it is that great of quality and the stitching is not done very well. After I put it on I was surprised that it did look as flattering and cute as it did. I am not saying that it is one of the cutest dresses I have ever had, but I guess it just looked a little better than I was expecting.<br />I usually wear a small in women size dresses and the small fits me pretty well. There really is not any stretch or give to it, so it fits me a little tight. I also am not super top heavy and it is a little snug around my chest. The length is a good length. It goes about a few inches above my knees, so it is not too short. I am about 5'4&#34;, but I do have pretty short legs.<br />I would probably have given this dress four stars, if it was not for the poor stitching. The stitching in the middle, near my cleavage, is not perfectly lined up and is a little uneven. Th stitching on the bottom of the dress is not done well, in that it does not lay quite right. It looks a little uneven on one side, but it is not super noticeable. Overall, I will probably wear this dress occasionally and probably only at night, so the imperfections are not as noticeable. I think it is a little overpriced for the quality. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I review products based on their quality and performance and welcome the opportunity to give both positive and negative reviews."
3.0,I feel there could have been more tull used to make this skirt more poofy.
3.0,I thought they prettier. They are more for teenagers than adults to me.
3.0,I bought these as warm gloves for winter. I found them too thick and bulky and sent them back.
3.0,These are sadly to tiny for even little hands to work with
3.0,It fit in length and waist but the arms had a sag to them
3.0,"Very cute, don‚Äôt stay on at all."
3.0,"Good quality material. I ordered a size 11-12 for my almost 10 year old. It is too big for even a 12 year old, and it even has bra cups! My daughter is definitely not ready for this. I will return this and maybe try to get a size smaller."
3.0,"This shirt has great shirt for active wear while hiking or exploring, breathing well and drying fast. And it is nice enough for casual evening wear while traveling. But realize that there's a zippered pocket located on the lower right hip seam. It's a change from their similar shirt a year or two ago. I missed seeing that in the description and it wasn't until I left the house and kept feeling something poking me in my right side that discovered it. It is a less stealthy-feeling zipper than I would prefer, messing with the drape of the shirt (even moreso if you happen to tuck in the shirt on the odd occasion).<br /><br />And if I actually put something in the pocket, it would be more awkward yet, pulling the shirt to the right, weighted down on that side but not the other.<br /><br />Hopefully, they'll return to making a simple polo of this great lightweight and well-wearing fabric, but without the oddly placed pocket and protruding zipper."
3.0,"Ok, I wanted to love these.  The patterns are great, the toggle feature helpful, the material soft. BUT, these things are so narrow that even with stretching as hard as possible they barely fit over my average head, so definitely issues for my husband.  My 5 year old can wear them just fine, so grab them for kids I guess."
3.0,If you‚Äôre tall this might work. I‚Äôm 5 ft 135lbs and curvy and the small was ginormous. It fit like a large and the back came down to my calves. I gave it to a friend.
3.0,"Looks better and more elegant in the picture. In person, the materials looks on the cheap side. A little deceiving."
3.0,"Purchased for my husband, who wears a size 10 EE shoe. The quality of the socks are excellent, however, the description says fits up to size 12, don't believe they could.  They would have been ideal for my husband to wear at night, except they are too tight in the ankle (uncomfortable) and somewhat small on foot."
3.0,"Really bummed about these sandals! I ordered the brown on brown and they arrived and are beautiful! I wear a size 7.5 or 8 depending on the shoe, so I figured a size 8 would fit me perfect. Ugh! I was wrong.  I definitely should've ordered a size 9, atleast! My feet spill out of these sandals like a girls waist that is wearing wayyy too tight pants. Totally bummed!  If the shoes were sized properly, I would've given them a 5.  They seemed like they would be comfortable and look fashionable.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

There is nothing I would change about it and I definitely recommend this to anyone who has an interest in purchasing.<br />4 stars ‚Äì This product is GREAT! If it were up to me, I would make a slight improvement to it or I may be slightly unimpressed with the way the product is packaged, but it is still a GREAT product and I would recommend to others.<br />3 stars ‚Äì Mehhh, this item or product is ok.  I would change quite a few things about it and I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend to any one.  It either seems cheap and/or lacking quality.<br />2 stars ‚Äì This product is no good.  It may be a good idea, but it was executed completely wrong and serves no purpose.  It is probably quick to break or malfunction or is completely worthless. I would not think about recommending this to anyone.<br />1 star ‚Äì Are you kidding me? Did I really waste my time ordering this item?? It is TERRIBLE!

3.0,"Order at least one size up. High waisted and tight in the waist. And, the belt was smaller than the waist. Ordered my normal size and they fit good in length and hips but, was too uncomfortable in the waist. I had to return them."
3.0,"it fits, but barely, the size is def not accurate. i recommend going up a size unless you wanna be squeezing your legs into this and praying it doesn‚Äôt shrink in the next wash.<br /><br />aesthetically, they are exactly as advertised and honestly super cute.<br /><br />also if your short it‚Äôs gonna feel like footie pajamas with how long the legs are."
3.0,Nice quality but way too short. Thought it'd be much longer.
3.0,My daughter loves it. It well put together but smells like mildew.
3.0,It runs small. I liked the feeling of it. It was very comfortable till I sat down and the zipper ripped off. I think the zipper should have been much higher up.
3.0,This shirt was way too small. Going up a size or two would not have helped. The qyality and design are great. Too bad it didn't fit.
3.0,"I think it's a good deal for the price. They were queen size which stretched out during the day and I had to keep pulling them up a few times. But I have long skinny legs and should have bought  a smaller size.  I would not wear these on a date they just are not sexy enough even though they ""feel"" fine. "" What? They ""feel"" fine?"" They are good enough for everyday around town and work."
3.0,"The print wasn't actually pink, but more of maroon-ish."
3.0,I wish it was a pedometer and it told you calories burned
3.0,"fit is well. but these collars are too big for a large, something wrong at production."
3.0,The gold color has a bit of an orange cast so it looks a little odd
3.0,These run very small I ordered the size I normally wear and it was too small so I ordered a size larger and it was still too small
3.0,"Had a bigger buckle than I thought, didn't work for what I needed it for but I will use it sometime."
3.0,It was gaping at the under arm area and I wasn‚Äôt equipped with the right kind of strapless bra nor did I feel comfortable going braless. It has a great look to it and really not bad quality for the price. I just didn‚Äôt have time to make alterations on it.
3.0,"I wanted some 'around the house and briefly outside slippers' and settled on these. They don't have the memory foam soles that compress in a few days or weeks. The sole is hard rubber or whatever they use these days as a rubber substitute. The problem I have with these slippers is that they have a rough texture throughout the inside. They feel a lot more comfortable with socks on, but that kind of defeats the purpose. For wearing for short duration they are adequate, but anything longer and the tops of the feet (my feet) start to get a bit irritated.<br /><br />Addendum/update: Over time these slippers have not become any more comfortable. The inside lining is just too coarse/rough in my opinion. The overall construction is very sturdy and I expect they will last for years. BUT, I do not recommend them for anyone looking for slippers to wear continuously for any length of time."
3.0,Shoes are great except that near the lace it looks like it‚Äôs torn but otherwise they‚Äôre good
3.0,Weird slick material and runs small
3.0,The plastic is comfortable and bends no problem. Easy to clean. Works great. Just
3.0,Im always a 7 in all my MK shoes but this one barely fits. I wore them today and they were so tight on me even after I left them for a week stretching  with my shoe tree. I waited so long to buy these shoes and now I can‚Äôt wear them :(
3.0,I‚Äôm giving this 3 stars because of the fabric. It is shiny and not mat. I thought about sending it back but decided to use it as a swim coverup. Fits true to size. I‚Äôm a size 4 and order the small.
3.0,The gloves are ok. The touchscreen works well and it is water resistant however -30 is very misleading. If you are in the cold for 15 minutes you will definitely feel your hands getting cold. Sorry just not that warm
3.0,"OK quality item, but way too large. I ordered XS-S which is supposed to be for size 2-6. It was bought for my size 2 daughter but was hugeeven on my size 6 body. Sleeves covered my hands and length went almost to the floor  I returned the item."
3.0,"Not gonna lie, if you are only standing this product is great. But when you sit down it will start to roll, and need adjustment which would require you to completely undo it and re wrap. Maybe if they updated the product to have rubber edges through the whole length of it, it would be a 10 out of ten. It is very long which i think is great because it makes it more sturday. It snatches my body up like a goddess.  Just the whole rolling issue with sitting is preventing me from wearing this anywhere. Low key sad. Gonna try wrapping this over my corset to see if it rolls still."
3.0,Daughter loves the design but the sizes run way too small!
3.0,wrinkly when fully compressed
3.0,Cute and affordable but very very thin
3.0,Beautiful dress but was too big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 140lbs and for a medium but it was too big:(
3.0,Too sparkly
3.0,"A PW that could be known as a real gem needs or wants to be know as one. The color of silver chrome is always a delight to have others see. Which is a good sign, But when you expose the dash and its that of a pocket watch, then that is what you have, a pocket watch. The spider web has so much going for it. What would you figure that this is a Zoot Suit watch. Put on a nice chain and spin it around like a Zooter did in the 40's. That's what it is with this dash.<br />The case I can say is very nice. Its hard to make out what the rear of the case means, a lot of carved metal.<br />The dash has straight up numbers, nothing special about the hands, back ground is plain black, and an opening to watch the works."
3.0,Shopping and casual. The length is VERY long.
3.0,"Fabric is fine for golf. As others mentioned, armholes too big for sleeveless top ! Is wearable- not returning. Like  two toned colors. Washed well."
3.0,"Purchased for my Mom, she said the slipper socks were too small for her size 9N feet."
3.0,"This dress is really cute, but I‚Äôm only giving it three stars because it‚Äôs pretty sheer and I had to wear a slip under it to stop my underwear and bra from showing through. I bought it for hot weather so it defeated the purpose. It would probably be fine if you wore nude undergarments under it."
3.0,Nice looking design and color.  Shirt is thin and cheap.  Size was not good. Order one size bigger.
3.0,I like the shape of it is unique....
3.0,I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments on the dress already. It didn‚Äôt get five stars because there were a couple of places where the seams were ripped or just not sewn together in the first place. Not a big deal for me as I can sew them back up but wanted to be sure others knew especially for the price that there may be some defects.
3.0,Well I waited so long to get my trailer when I finally got it there was no directions wat so ever an I'm not the brightest bulb in the pack  so it took me a few days of trial and error to get it together other then that it's a great trailer
3.0,"The dress was a little snug, but I turned it into a Halloween costume anyway!"
3.0,There was no print on the back which was unexpected and I needed it for a Halloween costume.  Other than that it was perfect.
3.0,Way too small for a man's foot.  Looks like ankle socks :(
3.0,The sizes run small.<br />The price was good.
3.0,"They were very cute but did not hold up. The monster party was peeling off immediately after taking them out of the plastic, so kind of frustrating."
3.0,Product gets warm because of the material.
3.0,The sleeves are very short. The sleeves stop about 5 inches before my wrist.
3.0,Good flowing dress. Color not what I expected but nice for the money.
3.0,Muy sencilla y bonito
3.0,"These are generally good shorts. The ugh do what they say. My chief complaint is that there is a lot of territory between the crotch and the waistband. The waistband sits above the navel on me.  I'm not old enough to tuck my shirt into my underwear, but if I was these would be perfect."
3.0,"I liked the versatility of this jacket, being able to wear it 3 ways. It is nice and sturdy. The zipper is bad quality, gets stuck all the time. But the jacket did keep me warm in the winter time. Sizes run small, typically I wear a medium or sometimes a large because I like to layer up, I bought a large and it is snug, can‚Äôt really layer or wear a thick sweater with this."
3.0,I only wear it around the house it's so large haha. I should have gotten 2 sizes smaller than I did.
3.0,a lot smaller than it looks online
3.0,"THIS GOWN IS NOT COTTON!!  The description says 60% cotton. The tag says 80% Rayon, 20% spandex --no matter how you do the math, the % of cotton is still 0.  The fit and style were nice but I am specifically looking for cotton sleepwear."
3.0,They were pretty but I returned them because they were too big for me.
3.0,Picture was more distorted than expected
3.0,"I have another casio watch but that one doesn't have a backlit function so I wanted to purchase another one with backlit feature. I was bit disappointed when i found out the lighting is so weak and only light up left side of the screen. The color is in deemed green making it hard to read the time clearly in a deemed environment. And when it's complete dark you cannot really tell the time. I'm returning because of that. Other than that feature, if that feature is not important to you, it's a good watch."
3.0,"I have carpal tunnel and if my hands get cold they start to cramp, so I always have half fingered gloves on. These fit nice and snug right after purchase but quickly become a tad too stretched after just one day of wear.<br /><br />I wish someone would make a good quality version of these type gloves."
3.0,"Scarf is a little thin, but good quality"
3.0,"Not a bad slipper, but definitely running a full size small.  I wear a 10.5 and these fit like a 9.75."
3.0,"I can't see a woman wearing this, but a young teen might like it. The bracelet is inexpensively made of fabric and beads. It comes in a gift bag. If you have a 13 year old daughter or niece who likes shiny, organic looking stuff, this just might work as a little gift."
3.0,"I so wanted to like this dress but it just didint work for me.  It fit pretty true to size but I just couldnt figure out the wrap part, maybe I was doing it wrong, not sure?  Fabric was very nice and did seem good quality.  I am 5&#34;6 and 170 and the L was about 4 inchs above my knees."
3.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old and it fit well, the material is great, the fingers are hard to bend for a child but an adult could do it. My only issue is the big orange infinity stone stopped working, but the rest of them light up. I think the wire got disconnected inside. Maybe try to find a way to cover the wires inside somehow so they don‚Äôt rip. Otherwise this is an ok product for the price I paid, especially since it‚Äôs just a Halloween prop."
3.0,"I was able to replace the lenses with these.  I noticed once tighten, they did not provide a snug fit like the original lenses.  Hopefully, they will not pop out if dropped."
3.0,"I've been a big fan of Defeet's wool socks for well over a decade, using them to ride all thru winter and loving the high wool content in the fabric. These leg warmers matched Defeet's high level of quality and contain more wool than most other so-called ""wool"" accessories. My long experience with their socks has taught me that, while easy to care for, you have to expect a certain amount of garment shrink from them (I only hang/air dry my wool socks and never put them in the dryer). Unfortunately, while these leg warmers come in two lengths, they both have the same diameter. Right out of the package they were already too tight around the thigh. I knew that washing was going to make them even more constrictive and there was no way I was ever going to be comfortable riding in them. I was seriously bummed that I had to send them back."
3.0,This watch is beautiful but it fades and bends fast
3.0,Didn't know it would be so small. Too bad.
3.0,"On the fence about this jacket. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a trash bag as another reviewer said, has a silky (polyester silk) feel to it. Very light and not as puffy as I thought- on the thinner side. I am 130lbs. 5‚Äô9 and got the large. Hits right at the hip, but would not be able to wear bulky sweaters underneath and with that, don‚Äôt think it will be too warm. Hood is not insulated, more of a wind breaker and inner pockets don‚Äôt have a lining either, so maybe uncomfortable to keep too much in the inner pockets."
3.0,My dad loved this shirt as part of a Father‚Äôs Day gift.  He loves OB seasoning and we used this in a themed gift basket.  He normally wears an XL in t shirts.  He was so excited he tried this XL on right away over top of the shirt he was already wearing - and he was pretty much swimming in it width wise.  It is 100% cotton so hoping it will shrink when we wash and dry it.  He doesn‚Äôt want me to send it back for another size but I would recommend sizing down if you are on the fence about sizing.
3.0,It was a little too big. I normally wear a large and size 10 in pants....and it was too large at top and bottom
3.0,"The dress is adorable.... but doesn‚Äôt look exactly like the picture.  The sequins along the bottom are not purple like the rest of the dress.  They are more a pinkish magenta.  It clearly stands out that they don‚Äôt match.  When I spoke to the company via email they told me basically it‚Äôs the nature of clothing and they can‚Äôt do anything about it.  I‚Äôm crafty, so I made it work, but others may not want to do that.  There were lots of excess strings that had to be cut off.  Overall for the price it‚Äôs a cute dress, just know you‚Äôll probably be doing a little work to make it what you want.  I purchased different flowers for the front that didn‚Äôt look so cheesy, as well.  Overall adorable party dress, but less than ‚Äúelegant‚Äù."
3.0,Junior size not adult size
3.0,"Good shirt, runs small."
3.0,Too small in thighs for me.  VERY straight at top.
3.0,"Dress fit well, was not too tight or too long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 164 lbs. large fit well. The problem is that it arrived missing buttons, and the buttons it did have did not match. That‚Äôs an easy fix, but irritating."
3.0,looks great on body but dont get it caught on anything.
3.0,Zipper gets easily stuck. Pleats are messy
3.0,i was able to use them
3.0,Was not as heavy as I was expecting.
3.0,"I ordered this in a size Medium, but was sent a size Large. I hope after washing it it shrinks some, but oh well..it was cheap. Nice fabric & made well, just sent wrong size and since I usually wear a size small/medium with a 34C bust & 27/28 waist, the Large it a bit big. Here's to hoping it shrinks!<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />Weeks later, a lot of washes and this only shrank a little so I had to mend it a bit. Good thing I know how to sew! So, if you decide to buy this top, do so with caution. You may also be sent a large and this hasn't shrank much :("
3.0,The necklace is really pretty but the first day I wore it the pendant part with the jade piece fell off after wearing it for only 30 minutes.<br /><br />My boyfriend was able to fix it but the loop that holds the jade on still has a big gap.
3.0,"the bonnets are cute, well made. Mine seemed a bit small. I was upset that I ordered 2 and they sent me the exact same pattern on both of them."
3.0,"I ordered the SM and it fit but it was tight, I was looking for something a little looser and casual.  I am usually a size 6 and teeter between a medium and small, I should have sized up. I ordered the pink, and it seems lighter than the picture. It didn't pair well with my skin tone. I also noticed one side of the dress is rouched and the other is not, just something I didn't notice in the picture. I ended up returning but it probably would have been okay if I got a medium and a different color, but I was looking for something quick for an upcoming trip."
3.0,I wanted to love this... but mine broke after just a day.
3.0,"Very cute dress, but it's very small and short. It fits like an XL. I'm 5'11"" and 260 lbs and usually fit an XXL. This went above my ankles and was really tight around the chest and waist."
3.0,"Live the band, the shirt didn't fit. And the quality of the shirt was rough not soft at all. So disappointed"
3.0,Looks very pretty but the small diamonds look like they easily will fall out. I love the ring an it fits perfectly but i know the small diamonds will soon fall off so i will only wear the ring occasionally an not all the time as i wanted.i don't like that no one on the ring it says 925 for sterling silver mark. An theres little bubbly marks on the ring. Honestly though i love the ring.
3.0,"I ordered a size larger for my 8-year-old and it was still too small. The shoes are cute like Vans, although a bit cheap. I gave them to my 5-year-old niece. They should be fine for her."
3.0,"It didn't have the support that I wanted (38B), but the overall quality was good."
3.0,"These boots are extremely cute however seem a bit stiff and the bottom of them are extremely slippery.  My daughter has fell in the house several times on the hardwood floors due to this.  Other than those 2 things, they look soo cute on her!"
3.0,It is very beautiful and elegant. it looks like pic but it have a defect the zipper does not work correctly.. :-(
3.0,But they are large.  Nice non-the-less
3.0,Beautiful top but shrinks even on most delicate cycles. Lost top button on two identical items of different color but same make. It‚Äôs still a very lovely item. I can sew the replacement button on.
3.0,Don't get me wrong I love this bathing suit but...the bottoms were supposed to be a medium but they fit like a extra small...then the clips are hard to clip...when I was clipping one it broke the whole bathing suit and we had to end up putting a clip that you use to Hang up Christmas lights.
3.0,The plastic part it came with was uncomfortable for my teeth. I know it‚Äôs a little weird but I did changed it out with a baby pacifier. It was a lot more comfortable after I changed out the mouth part but other than that I had no other problems with it.
3.0,Material seems fine but I would suggest ordering a bigger size
3.0,Not great I ordered the ones that were black and white but they are muted green and beige. I usually wear a medium but I ordered large and they are very tight across my stomach. They don't have pockets and they do more to show the curve of your stomach than of your butt. They are okay but I wouldn't recommend them.
3.0,These are very small earrings. I have large fingers an was unable to use these.
3.0,"Material too thin, and was at least 5 inches too long...material very stretchy so hard to hem"
3.0,They are smaller than expected and not that comfortable.
3.0,"I will keep this necklace because of the Lapis Stone but after numerous attempts of putting lights on it, including in the sun, it doesn‚Äôt glow. While I don‚Äôt need it to glow, the description says it does, so therefore it should."
3.0,I love it but it's too small wish it was made to fit like a true Large
3.0,"This is great for someone with a long torso and maybe a B-Cup.  If you have a short torso and Ds, don't bother.  Otherwise it is a nice suit."
3.0,"The fit is great, but unfortunately both of my twin girls seem to keep having their heels pop out! These are warm, they are super cute, but don't have any way to get some extra grip on active baby feet!"
3.0,I got the product today. I ordered for a style 2 set but the stud is not as in the picture. It is totally different. bit disappointed. necklace looks good
3.0,"It's a cute dress.  Not a huge fan of the fabric, I would say they got the percent ratios backwards.  Overall not a bad dress for the price, I would buy another one.  It was fun to wear and I did teceive a lot of compliments."
3.0,"This bag is huge! If you need something to carry as a weekend bag it‚Äôs probably perfect, but it was just too big to use as a gym bag. Also, the smell is awful so much so that I returned it immediately."
3.0,These masks are pretty but need longer elastic. These are ideal for 5-9 year old kids or people with really small faces. These masks runs tight and will hurt ones ears if worn too long. Our daughters (ages 11 & 13) complain about it being too tight and cannot wear them in school all day (required in California). I can wear it for a quick dash into the store but not long at all. We have average size faces and other masks fit our faces comfortably.
3.0,"I like this, but it's hard sometimes to get the cards out of the holder."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt realize the material was so thin.
3.0,Some of the links appear a little bent...They catch the light differently.  Not enough of an issue to return it though.
3.0,Houghton it would be a little thicker compared to picture
3.0,Ordered larger than needed after reading reviews about this product being a girls not women‚Äôs sizing. Top fit ok shorts... well let‚Äôs say they are more like underwear! More booty than my sister would like to show
3.0,The bracelet was much too large for my seven-year-old daughter. She tried to make the best of it and wear it anyway but the velcros soon started to tear off. It only lasted a couple of weeks
3.0,Can barely see the camo design and small fit and just overall super cheap product... was generous with the 3 stars
3.0,"The wristwatch looks as promised: just what I was looking for.<br />Now: I actually would not judge a wristwatch until after I have worn it for a while, have - accidentally- immersed it into warm, soapy dishwater, have my Dog chew on it (this will be on purpose, because it now smells like me!) gotten it soaked in the rain...you get the drift!<br />Ask me in about 4 months."
3.0,"Beautiful but they are thinner than expected, they look very fragile."
3.0,I have long legs and the bottom of the dress did not hit right! Had to return it
3.0,These are comfortable slippers I will say that. The flaw is the left slipper is way narrower than the right slipper. So my left toes are being a little crunched but I'm hoping it'll stretch out over time. I didn't send them back because I didn't want to deal with the return or the fact that I would be without any slippers. So I'm just going to suck it up.
3.0,"It's taking me forever to try to bend them to fit my bottom teeth, they're to big"
3.0,"Chain is extremely small and did not fit around my girlfriend's neck, but dispite the size it was a beautiful chain."
3.0,Material was very thin and stretchy. Not very flattering
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter and she is a plus size they run small so go a size or two up,they are thin so if you want them for warmth get something lined."
3.0,"On the CON side: I bought these beautiful diamond hoop prong earrings earrings for my daughter's birthday. When she tried to wear them she couldn't get the wire through her earlobe because it had a thick end that snapped into the opposite side of the earring which locked it in place instead of the snap down wire into an open prong.  I then tried to see if I could fit them into my ears and had the same problem.<br /><br />PRO:  These earrings were delivered promptly and beautifully packaged by the seller.  When I contacted them for support in returning the earrings there was a delay at first in email communication but was promptly corrected in a phone call from them advising me they would send detailed information of what they required along with labels to return the product; also, they were very pleasant and apologized and once they received the item I was quickly issued a refund by Amazon the next day.<br /><br />The earrings are so pretty and my daughter hated giving them up and the only reason I gave it a three star was because of the wire end being so thick as to not go through either of our earlobes.  It was hard to detect it was not a snap down wire from the illustration as I assumed it was; but probably should have realized since the earring has a hinged loop.<br /><br />The seller was great to work with and I have no issues with them."
3.0,Flimsy but ornate. Ties are short which causes you to pull it tighter across face. Wouldn't buy again for myself but maybe someone with a smaller head! :-)
3.0,"Love the pattern. Very cute once it's on, but every time I put this on it's like playing a game of Cat's Cradle. Once I've figured out where all the strings go, I struggle to even it out.  Then all good for being sedentary and looking cute. Maybe because I'm small on top, but when I swim it rides up and my boobs pop out.<br />So loses 2 stars for being a bit of a pain to get into and for boob escape when swimming."
3.0,"Ok,"
3.0,"Exactly what you‚Äôre buying. The entire pink diamond piece in the middle looks very cheap, but the surrounding diamonds look nice. Wearing it shouldn‚Äôt be too noticeable but the pink rhinestone also isn‚Äôt very sparkely. It‚Äôs also very big, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for someone with a tiny belly button"
3.0,"Cheap looking, but perfect for my ten year old dancing gymnast. Chain looks sturdy."
3.0,Not the one I ordered though but it was a great dress regardless.
3.0,After reading the reviews that this wrap ran small I decided to order this wrap in 2 sizes too big. When I received the wrap I thought surely it will fit because I ordered it so big. Sadly it didn‚Äôt fit at all still. If you‚Äôre planning to buy this I‚Äôd make sure to order way bigger than you think you‚Äôll need.
3.0,It feels stretched out.
3.0,"The watch is great--the resin strap isn't. The flexing in putting the watch on and taking it off caused the strap to break. The watch itself still works perfectly. A replacement strap costs about as much as the complete watch, and the strap is mechanically difficult to replace. As a result I opted to purchase a complete new watch."
3.0,"These fell off my head, onto the tile floor... I'm 5'9"" so they fell almost 6 feet onto a hard surface. Right lens shattered. I LOVE the way these fit (few glasses fit me well), so I'm really bummed, and not sure what to get now that Revo doesn't make this anymore."
3.0,Bought this shirt to wear on Christmas Day but ended up giving to my grandson because it was very small.
3.0,Beautiful but wore it for 3 days and gems are falling out!
3.0,Material is very soft and thin.  It is great to sleep  with!  It does run small so consider one size or two up.
3.0,I do not like the F because it is stiff and looks crooked. Too much trouble to return.
3.0,"Super cute, but if you're a larger bra size (I'm a 36 DD) it won't work. I had to unhook it to continue wearing it for the day."
3.0,Quality is lacking. But you get what you pay for.
3.0,"These are really cute but the top is so long, it creates a silhouette that makes me look 10lbs heavier.  Very well made, comfortable but just wish the top wasn‚Äôt quite so long."
3.0,"They seemed to be a decent quality, but if you have a smaller face they will not fit. 3 stars because of the quick and painless return."
3.0,cute but not on me. sleeve ruffles are heavy
3.0,Good size to fit my glasses and the case for my contacts. Love the cute design.
3.0,"I have a feeling the reviews on this are so good because people got it at a discount in return for a review.<br />I loved the look and thought it would make a good beach cover or dress, but I was concerned about color leakage, so I washed it with a lot of dark stuff and a color-catcher sheet right away.  First weird thing was that it was the green that was caught in the catcher sheet.  No big deal; the other items were fine.  The problem came when several places had loose stitching and I ended up with my clothes all tangled up with it.  Before putting it in the drying I found and tied off the loose stitching only to find out that there must have been others because it was worse after drying.  It's still cute, but I'm afraid to wash it.  I'll definitely use a garment bag next time."
3.0,Not expecting the material
3.0,Fit is fine. Item cute BUT IT SMELLS LIKE A FIRE OR SMOKE.
3.0,The curl is a bit wispy and detangling after shipping is going to take some careful work so as not to pull out the hair. I was surprised at how long 33 inches of hair is and may need to trim it.
3.0,I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and this dress was very short on me
3.0,Very cute earrings I thought they were a little thinner than what they were but I do have long hair and when I put them in my ears they looked cute
3.0,"Wasn‚Äôt the shade of orange I was expecting, but it was still a cute top"
3.0,"I loved the suit. My issue is bottoms were too small. The suit is absolutely adorable. The material is definitely somewhat cheap. I don't think it will last long, as there already are seams that are pulling apart."
3.0,"The length and sleeves were too long, but the shoulders were too tight.  I returned it."
3.0,"Ordered XXl but fits more like a medium.  Material is nice, color is nice and style is nice...but way too small"
3.0,Missing 2 stones. But a very beautiful ring.
3.0,"Not sure as he has not been able to use them yet. He is just out of surgery a couple of days ago so was hospitalized til today and is on the way to a rehabilitation center so will find out then when he starts to use them. Very thin material. Not sure they will be warm enough or be very durable wearing, Disappointed."
3.0,"Material is thicker than expected and also short. I am only 5'3"" and felt it was short for me."
3.0,Lots of loose strings. Seems pretty cheaply made.
3.0,"I'm usually a L, but I got an XL just in case it ran small and it was still too tight. More like a M."
3.0,"Its ok I was hoping I could use in place of another tank I use to train in, but instead its just a cozy pajama. Hook broke in first wash, so only somewhat cozy."
3.0,"I am so disappointed because the fabric of this t-shirt is heavenly!  It‚Äôs thick, it‚Äôs soft, it feels like a dream.<br /><br />The disappointing part is with the craftsmanship of the word art.  It‚Äôs too high up on the t-shirt, it‚Äôs off-center, and the wording is too small.<br /><br />Making sure the lettering is centered and the letting font size is adjusted based on the t-shirt size, is a HUGE part of a successful t-shirt business.<br /><br />I wish I could exchange this for a t-shirt done correctly, but the only option is to return.<br /><br />If you plan on wearing this around the house or to bed, the t-shirt quality is seriously amazing.  If you care about the letter placement and/or planning to wear this with your favorite jeans (like me) skip this and find a company that has letter placement down to a science."
3.0,Bottoms fit great! Top is a little off - could just be the cut. Padded well. Not much support. Will still be a good lake suit.
3.0,Underpants ended up being too short.  Better as swimming pants tho.
3.0,Too sheer. You can see right through it & hardly any stretch at all.
3.0,The back of the earnings are not what‚Äôs shown in the picture .
3.0,"Dress is sexy, in need of seamstress to align first and second Layers. Highly see-through."
3.0,RTA 3/29
3.0,"They fit okay and serve the purpose,  but my other face shield are more comfortable"
3.0,This does not match the iwatch 5 gold color. It‚Äôs more gold than the rose gold of the watch.
3.0,"Beautiful in color and design but are too small for my wrist, but perfect for more petite women or a child."
3.0,"I ordered a small, but the shirt ended almost at my knees"
3.0,"It came in pink, not red."
3.0,"It's small, but ok! And not the one I actually ordered!!!"
3.0,I like the color and the size is good. But the material should be a better quality for the style. But........... you get what you pay for with these sites.
3.0,Bottom is tighter than expected.
3.0,"Seems a little cheap, not sure if its even authentic or anything, the mesh is ruff, seams and threading are messy and all over the place on the inside. Kinda seems like a cheap trucker that someone slapped a creature logo on"
3.0,I liked it but the crisscross cutouts were to tight and the skin protrudes out. Not to attractive.
3.0,Pads are weirdly firm.
3.0,"I love the way these look. They're so pretty.<br /><br />They are plastic, so be aware of that if you're looking for glass or metal. These aren't the plugs you're looking for.<br /><br />Don't screw them on too tight. And make sure you screw them on completely straight. Because they're plastic, they break easier than most.<br /><br />I've had mine for a couple months and they just broke - the plastic cracked off and I couldn't screw them in anymore. I was devastated as they are my FAVORITE plugs. Maybe with this nice review I can get a replacement? hehe<br /><br />Anyway, I think they're worth the purchase even though there's a couple issues with them."
3.0,Does not work with heavy chest but the bottoms are cute.
3.0,"Thin material, it's ok, nothing terribly exciting, but it's cute. It's not super short, fits as expected."
3.0,String holding mask came apart
3.0,It was a nice night gown but I bought a 8-9 year old size and my daughter is 6 this barley fits.
3.0,"It's really cute, but very light, cheaper fabric.  If you are slim, it will work for you.  I ordered a large or x-large, and it fits but isn't near long enough.  I'm 5' 7"".  Nice and long in the sleeves."
3.0,This fit small.
3.0,Cute and looks like the picture. The chain is much longer than expected. I wish it was shorter. It took forever and a day to come but it was cheap so no complaints from me
3.0,"The hinges for the loops are relatively sharp, face inward and poke the skin, pants, whatever is there.  The material was a good quality if they would fix the hinges."
3.0,Overall I liked the color but only wore it once.  It shrunk when placed in the dryer on DELICATE.  Gave it away. üòû
3.0,"This purse is a beautiful little purse and my granddaughter, age 14, loves it.  The problem, she used it two days and the strap came loose.  The straps need to be attached with a heavy duty leather piece or something.  It shouldn't come apart the 2nd time she used it.  I did order another one, because she liked it so much, but I'm going to take it to an upholstery shop and have them reinforce the straps on both sides before she uses it."
3.0,I just didn‚Äôt like the fit. Looked boxy!<br />I returned it!
3.0,"Headline says it all.  HUK is one of my favorite shirt lines, but this one has a ""rough"" feel to it unlike most of their products that are crazy soft and smooth."
3.0,"Does the job but if you are looking for a lobster clasp with springs, this is not the product for you."
3.0,"I wanted a very modest bathing suit that would completely cover me up. This fits the bill‚Ä¶.. mostly. The padding in the top moves‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt like that. You potentially move a lot in a bathing suit, and if the padding isn‚Äôt secure‚Ä¶. It moves, and eventually it doesn‚Äôt cover what you want/need it to cover."
3.0,Too long for somone that is short.
3.0,Waist was way smaller that the measurements outlined in the sizing table. I hope the return goes smoothly because the shorts are exactly what I was looking for other than that!
3.0,I like it.  It is a bit heavier than a straw hat and has venting holes on the side that are covered with a small metal screen.  It does a good job of shading my head and face from the sun--which is my primary goal.
3.0,While it is stylish some of the black plastic on my bigger keys were completely scraped getting the key on
3.0,To small for a man... Gave to my daughter....
3.0,NOT AS LONG AS I THOUGHT
3.0,"The XL will fit a woman of 5'4&#34; whocs maybe a size 8. The fabric doesn't stretch at all. Be warned. This dress is for very small, petite women. It's beautiful, though. I'm keeping it and taking the wings off to attach to another, better fitting dress."
3.0,They were hard to open. I had to use pliers to open the black one and it scraped the black garnish off. I still wore it for a long time.
3.0,"The yellow visor is really &#34;goldenrod&#34;, and I don't know about the fit because I didn't open it... It was a forced choice question."
3.0,"Very cute product, but smelt so bad!!!"
3.0,cool looking but runs small compared to competitor sizing.
3.0,Cheap enough in price. Daughter thinks they're cute. Not made all that well but you get what you pay for.
3.0,not so pleased with the dull print.
3.0,"I was very happy with this product.  The hat was nice quality.  The material was very soft & not itchy.  It fit well & looked good on me.  I wore it on one run so far, & it stayed in place & kept me warm, while still being comfortable to wear.  I have a low, short ponytail when running, & the hat fit very easily over it.  The only downside to the cap, is my head does not completely fill it, so there is some loose fabric at the top."
3.0,Like the sweater except the sleeves are too short and I dont have long arms and that's before washing!
3.0,Hi-waist is  way too high for me.<br />Too long. I think I will just stick to regular leggings.
3.0,"Shoes were great to start with. I am not thrilled with how quickly the Velcro broke down, they no longer stay closed after wearing for about 6 weeks."
3.0,The sizing is all over depending on the print. The solids fit well and the prints are smaller!
3.0,"This was not as pretty in person as it was on the site.  2 of the stones were loose and part of the metal was bent where the stones were inserted.  It's ok looking, but not exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,nice but very sloppy assembly. both earrings look different and the arrangement of the crystals is poor and there are gaps between some. not as picture may look
3.0,Poorly made. Cheap plastic. Arrived broken.
3.0,"Good and works like any other ratchet belt on the market, although this one is a little more expensive.  The buckle mechanism seems to work slightly better than others because of a more solid spring.  The buckle also has a slimmer profile than most.  However the belt is another story - mine came wound up in a weird square shape and took a little while to get straightened out.  The ratchet section is also visibly seen on the other side of the belt, which isn't very good aesthetically (see photo).  There's also a fairly strong odor to the belt and the ratchet side is unusually sticky/tacky."
3.0,The pendant is cute but the chain is chunky and looks very cheap.
3.0,Cute. A little larger than I expected but will be cute at Xmas time!
3.0,Awesome watch right up to the day it quit working. If you do any kind of work where you move your arms a lot be careful with this watch it may break. Mine did very suddenly quit and no amount of shaking or moving the button would make it work.
3.0,"Nice fabric, well made, but very fitted and runs small.  Bought my normal size (M), but it fits like a size smaller."
3.0,The straps are larger than expected and it is a worn t shirt without a clean hem. Comfy to sleep in or wear over a swim suit or sports bra for the gym
3.0,Very good quality tights BUT they run very small and have a chemical smell.
3.0,"This watch is interesting in that the face takes on a different color depending on the strength and direction of the light.  Goes from black, to brown to blue.  The large chronograph dials are nice, only giving 60 second timing, and the date window is very small.  The band is lightweight.  I  am docking two stars for the very loose movement in the minutes hand when depressing the stem to set."
3.0,"I can truly say it is a very pretty fur , but the size is not true to the picture on the manikin.It is very deceiving, It fits nothing like it looks, I chose the longest one they had and it was only good enough for my coats hood.  I wanted to use it like it shows in the picture."
3.0,They should include the restrictions of activities and getting wet in their descriptions.  They can only wear these indoors because you can't tell a 5 year old not the stomp in the puddles on their way to and from school!
3.0,Very good neoprene shorts but the size runs very small
3.0,It fits kinda tight on me but i love the shirt
3.0,I had a lot of high hopes for this dress. I had it on a wishlist for a few months and decided to purchase it. It showed up in a Meaneor bag and I was excited because I have ordered a lot from them and everything was always great.<br />BUT I was severely dissappointed. It fit more like a medium in the top. Squished my arms and chest. I thought since this was a drawstring dress I could order the largest size and adjust the waist. The bottom is more straight than flowwy which is confusing as to why you would need to add a drawstring in a straight dress. Needless to say I ordered this dress in the largest size thinking that it would be way too big (which is what I wanted) and it was 2 to 3 sizes too small up top.
3.0,"A little bigger than I thought they'd be...but not a bad thing.  The coloring seems off. It feels like the person/machine which painted it, barely got it in the lines. Still, you have to be pretty close to see it. They're alright. In real life, the colors are bold, just somehow not as vibrant as in the image."
3.0,Cute but there was some lose thread in some places
3.0,Stones are very nice but are much smaller than pictured.
3.0,its very pretty but doesnt have much stretch for it to be comfortable.
3.0,"I give this bikini 5 stars for fit, quality, and feel. For $20, this bikini is great! It has a pretty thick and stretchy material, also quite soft. However, the misleading blue color brings it down to a 3 because the blue online looks like a cute light blue but in person it is very dark, like a dark grey almost. Not at all as pictured. Going to return for white or yellow"
3.0,"Had to return this dress, it was about two sizes too small, especially in the bust. If it had fit, the cut and design was beautiful. The material felt inexpensive and has no liner, but still a good value."
3.0,"Way to small in the bust area ...... But I'm a DD, so most items run tight."
3.0,There is material in the bottom that will cut and stab your legs while moving around
3.0,Alot smaller than the picture.  Not worth $40
3.0,"Not a fan of back pockets in sweats or shorts. I bought these to lounge- that means sitting a lot around the house.<br /><br />Good product otherwise. Just a personal deal breaker for me.<br /><br />They're kinda short, but thankfully the stretch means you won't flash anybody from the leg openings if you kick back on your couch."
3.0,senti emocion cuando vi la camisa que me llego hace dos dias por que los dibujos estan lindos y es perfecta para mi hijo. lamentablemnete hoy que se la estoy estrenando justo antes de llegar al colegio vimos que tiene un hueco que es poe mala costura. Me senti decepcionada y mas al ver la cara de tristeza de mi hijo
3.0,I love the flow of the dress. I dislike that the chest area is too tight.  Seems are slightly off<br />But overall it is one of my favorite dresses
3.0,I‚Äôm normally a small and ordered a size small. The waist band was really right and the length was just a tad too short (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù). Definitely size up. Was also super cheap looking
3.0,This is nice to have when traveling but maybe for a smaller cup size.  I'm a size 32D and my bras barely fit; I kind of had to force it in. This is just for A-C cups.  I gave it to my daughter and she likes it for it's purpose.  And you can put about 6 panties on the mesh pocket on the other side without it being too crowded with the bras.
3.0,great colors will go with many different tops
3.0,It's a great costume other than you can't see out of the mask. Which hinders walking and that's a tad important lol other than that it is very nice. No issues so far other than being blind with mask on.
3.0,"Light and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, but they do not get dark enough."
3.0,I bought 2 - a 24&#34; and a 20&#34;<br />The 20&#34; link broke after 2 weeks<br />The 24&#34; is great
3.0,"Nice watch, but it looks bigger than I expected."
3.0,I have had three pairs of these. I like them for the first 9-10 months. Then the magnet comes unglued and never really is the same even after regluing them. Good for awhile tho.
3.0,"Looks are great obviously, but the little velcro strap always rubs on your neck no matter how you attach it. That is extremely frustrating and cant be worn every day like that. This would be manageable for wearing to the games as it is advertised but dont make this your everyday badge lanyard or key lanyard."
3.0,You can not beat this price for this item. My wife is English & is enjoying her charms & bracelet for her birthday.
3.0,Gave it to my mom was to big for me when I have ordered other things and was a medium. Grate quality tho.
3.0,"Normally I find this clothing line to run true to size but this top runs smaller than normal and I would recommend ordering a size up. I am 5'5 and the shirt is quite long, maybe better suited for taller gals. The color and style are as pictured."
3.0,I'm not a fan of the fabric or fit. This top won't drape on your hips like shown in the photo unless you have absolutely no hips or belly. It was returned.
3.0,"the xl was more like a small, I gave it to my daughter"
3.0,Nice quality product but I gave it a 3 only because none of the sayings on the charms are what I ordered. I ordered this product specifically for the sayings that were shown on the item photo. I need them for tomorrow so I will have to try and use the ones I received.
3.0,I use it but it's difficult .. My hands are so arthritic.. however with out it I couldn't put bracelets on at all.
3.0,Not as elegant as expected
3.0,"The top was a little too big, although I loved everything about it."
3.0,I ordered Medium and I got XL. These are good camis but it would have helped if I could have gotten my size. The XL is too baggy for me.
3.0,"True to color and style  and looks nice on but fit is not as relaxed as in photo, but I'm not as slim in my waistline as model. But I still like it. Fabric is a polyester knit and soft but would be nicer if had more cotton mix."
3.0,Very high quality didn't expect that. Good color too. However sadly too small. I don't have anything to measure myself and I'm a XL Male US. Sadly had to return it. 3 stars for being great cool shirt but didn't fit me and I had nothing to measure myself.
3.0,"Can't really review this item, it was a birthday gift for someone"
3.0,"When I opened the first time, there was a little cut like a little line made with a cutter in the middle of the fabric of the umbrella, there is no real issue but is not what I expected to see"
3.0,"for what i got in the mail, these are a nice set, lots of pairs of earrings. how ever i thought mine was to have animal prints on their, that was the whole reason i got these was cause i love cats and it had in the pic, cats or to due with cats. well mine that came didn't and i'm very disappointed, maybe i read something wrong i don't know but i was not  happy. so lesson learned don't just look at the pic read what it says, cause i wouldn't have bought these, now i have no use for what i have."
3.0,3
3.0,"I purchased this bathing suit for my aunt. The style is really cute & the blue is so nice & bright, its very pretty. The top fit her very nicely, but bottoms were way to big. Wish there was a way to mix & match sizes!"
3.0,"This jacket fits and looks nice, but unfortunately this is paper thin. It's fine if that's what you're looking for, but I was hoping for something that would keep me a bit warmer. This might work as a layer, but definitely not as a jacket."
3.0,"They‚Äôre super cute, but I must have a small head, they constantly slip."
3.0,I purchased this bag for 9.99 a few months ago and loved the bag but I over stuffed it and the handles that hold the straps tore from the bag. So I purchased another one but the faux leather doesn't look the same and the inside is not cloth material it's skimpy noisy paper like material and the zippers are cheap. I paid $21.00 for this one and it's cheaper looking and feeling than the $10 one. What a disappointment
3.0,Just...ok...a little short...hoping the fabric stretches out over time...
3.0,"Not great quality, fits loose, and not forming"
3.0,"It looks nice and feels great, but it seems like the battery might have to be replaced though, other than that for fashion purposes it looks great and you can change the bands which is nice too."
3.0,"Too large on me, so I h ad to return this item.üòï"
3.0,"And they are very intricate and closely resemble the classical ‚Äúwheels‚Äù angel, so we love them ‚ù§Ô∏è"
3.0,Love it but he leather wares out fast and seems like it wants to break
3.0,First trip cover ripped can't use again
3.0,Slightly small for me. Had to return.<br />Item as shown in picture.
3.0,Bangle looked like it would have been beautiful and it's think and well crafted. The packaging mine was in was poorly protected and broke in the mail üò≠ what a waste.
3.0,"Nice dress, but runs small, especially if you are thick in the middle. I‚Äôm a 10 and the large was too small."
3.0,"I was at first disappointed in these pearls because I thought the 5MM size would be bigger (my fault), but I have decided that they are a perfect size for the second piercing above my earlobe. They have a good luster, but are sloppily mounted and for a cultured pearl are not completely rounded. Actually, one of them is slightly larger than the other! Even so, with these flaws, I still plan to wear them as I don‚Äôt think most people would notice that when wearing them."
3.0,"As pretty as this looks, the fabric wasn't very comfortable.  I don't mind swimsuit materials but this was scratchy."
3.0,Get what you pay for I guess. I lost one of the belt loops (why does this come off?) Quality is OK. A little long for someone with a 33&#34; waist.
3.0,not what I expected. it's not king size rose is  more a medium size rose
3.0,You get what you pay for. They‚Äôre not bad they‚Äôre not wonderful. The only problem is you can hear the ‚Äújewels‚Äù moving inside the plugs so there‚Äôs a constant clicking noise as you walk around.
3.0,"My daughter LOVES this hoodie. The only thing she notices is that the hood doesn‚Äôt have the pink eyes.<br /><br />However, this material is AWFUL. The seams aren‚Äôt sewn well, the material feels cheap, and it stains easily.<br /><br />I feel it is overpriced for what you get.<br /><br />However, I scoured the internet to find my little one a ‚Äúghost spidey jacket‚Äù and she‚Äôs over the moon."
3.0,"Out of the package it looks huge, but once I tried it on it fit pretty snugly, and doesn't have too much stretch. I suggest ordering a size up."
3.0,"Shipping was prompt so pleased about that!  Can only rate 3 stars as it was bought for a gift!! Haven't ""personally tried"" them to rate higher....If given a second chance to review AFTER the holiday, I'd be happy to let you know his opinion!  :)"
3.0,"It was just a tad on the big size. I double checked the sizing of my watch, and it was the straps not being to spec. Just a half mil to wide. I squeezed them in but chaffing shaved a bit off the strap at the connection.<br /><br />The notches are cut for a person with exceptionally thick wrists. I had to drill some holes of my own in to fit me.<br /><br />All this is hardly noticeable though and the strap looks good despite the minor details that no one else will notice."
3.0,It's thin and the zipper broke 2 weeks after I had it.  I had to get all the loose thread away from the zipper
3.0,I like Allegra k but with this shirt I should have ordered one size up. Excellent quality and I‚Äôll try to make it work .
3.0,"I love this bag. I love oversized purses and this one fits the bill. it could be an overnight bag or a perfect carry on, or even a diaper bag. I have to give it only three stars though because while it's nice a sturdy otherwise, the zipper on the back pocket where I keep my keys, phone, and other items I need often broke after the first month of using the bag. the zipper pull fell off and therefore that pocket is pretty much unusable. then the zipper on one of the inside pockets where I HAD been storing those items since the back zipper busted broke as well, and I couldn't get to those items without having to cut a hole in the pocket itself. overall the quality is decent, but I expected it to last much longer. I've been carrying it for four months now and finally got around to buying something else because two of the storage pockets aren't functional any longer."
3.0,Like it but too sheer
3.0,Red flower dress is not as pretty as described
3.0,"Looks like a very cute item & my daughter asks me every day,when it will get here. Ordered it way before Christmas & still nothing."
3.0,This is absolutely a Tote Bag on a small scale. When I searched for a new Lunch Bag/Cooler surprisingly this came up in my search and its super cute so I purchased. Although this is totally cute it really is a soft bag not at all structured like a lunch Bag usually is. But the pattern and colors are totally cute and it is really well made.
3.0,i didnt like how big the neck part is and the mouth part wasn‚Äôt well designed but it‚Äôs a pretty good mask
3.0,Ordered my normal size and it is so baggy I wont wear it. Otherwise the quality of the shirt is good.
3.0,Runs a little small; ordered navy and the color is not what I expected. They are soft but have a lot of seams up around the waist which may not be flattering if you‚Äôre not fit.
3.0,"I absolutely loved this pendent however the glowing piece came loose and fell off after only 3 weeks. Am pretty bummed as it was a meaningful gift, and I feel that for the price range it shouldn‚Äôt have come apart so quickly."
3.0,"While the Byinns sweater looks better in photos than in person, it still has a lot of potential. It looks well made in the photos, but in person, it appears to be a bit cheap. The material (acrylic) is soft, but I can tell that it will look worn over time.  The color (sky blue) and pattern (weave) are nice. I wore it with gray slacks and a jacket, but it can be worn with most colors like navy, black or khaki. However, don‚Äôt fear, this sweater can even be worn casually with jeans. Just add some cute jewelry and you are good to go."
3.0,It‚Äôs not bad for the price but have it has a dent in the middle of bra and the straps are lose and everything
3.0,When I got them they were great and comfortable. After about 2 washes they were falling apart at the seams. Never will purchase again.
3.0,"Nice, but i do wish the fabric was a little thicker. My wife enjoyed them."
3.0,There is no description/info on the length and size of the CHAIN itself. WHY?<br />I love the pendent as seen on the pic
3.0,Did not have too high of an expectation cobsidering the price. Handel already ripping away from bag after 1st use. Its cute though.
3.0,The pig is very disproportionate which makes it look fairly comical.
3.0,"I ordered large thinking it may run small. I should have stuck with mediium. I will alter to fit. It is just Ok for me, not in love, and don‚Äôt dislike. Not really crazy about the polyester knit fabric."
3.0,This dress does not look like the picture.  I'm normally a size 10 but ordered a size 12 and it fit big...I guess you have to be a size 0  and wear a tulle petticoat to look like the picture.
3.0,I expected the lenses to be a little bigger but not bad for the price
3.0,"I bought this shirt in what was supposed to be wine red. It turned out to be a shimmery bright Christmassy red. I bought xl as I typically wear anywhere from m to xl depending on style but expected this shirt to run small. It didn't. The xl was too big. The garment seemed to be high quality, but it wasn't a match for me. I sent it back."
3.0,"My husband absolutely loves this dress. But, the pockets make my hips look weird"
3.0,"The ganesha is great, although very small.  The chain broke."
3.0,Ran a little big but still super comfy and shipping was fast as frick!!  I usually am a small and read some of the reviews so ordered a size up and was a mistake. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 123lbs on a good day üòÇ
3.0,Beautiful but it was too small for a large. Fit more like a medium (6-8) I was disappointed I gave it to my daughter to try on. May still send it back
3.0,Good material and good quality.
3.0,"Love the look and feel of it.... However, it's too big for my waist. Having a difficult time making a extra holes for it."
3.0,Too small and a bit see through. Returned it
3.0,"They are okay. My pair did not come with the cute fabric belt, and they run super small.  Like 2 sizes too small. However, I do really like them, so I'm using them as my &#34;goal&#34; for the summer."
3.0,Kinda bulky for me
3.0,"These pants are super cute and actually pretty good quality. Their not soft but do feel like your typical cargo pants. The main issue for me was that legs are too short. So if you‚Äôre tall and long legged, these are the perfect pants for you!"
3.0,It was decent
3.0,"Please know I still would order from this company it's just this one in particular did not come as I expected I had gotten a size large before orange color and fit perfectly, I ordered another, this green one same size and slightly loose around belly area more than expected to where it doesn't look right and the seaming of the little ruffle on the side looked as if done incorrectly"
3.0,"I went by the size chart and ordered an xl. I normally wear a L-XL, but this fit more like a M-L. The fabric is beautiful,  but it has absolutly no stretch. This was super tight in chest and shoulder area, so if you are at least an A cup think twice before you purchase this."
3.0,"These gloves are a great idea in that they go all the way up the child‚Äôs arm and you don‚Äôt have to worry about them falling off. But we bought these less than a month ago, have only used them with our son four times and they have already ripped! He doesn‚Äôt over use them or do any extra vigorous activity in them since he‚Äôs only two so I was very disappointed to see the rip already."
3.0,"It arrived broken. It didn't take long to fix, but still. Besides that, I love it! Very cute, and very 90's. Fits perfectly and I love that it's adjustable. It arrived a month earlier, so that's a plus!"
3.0,"It would look great on a 6‚Äô6‚Äù curvaceous amazon, but not on a 5‚Äô8‚Äù 121 lb me. Bunchy and weird, especially around the middle."
3.0,"I love the way it flows! I was worried it would look bad on my 5'3&#34; frame but a medium was perfect! I am a 34 dd and it is not tight, but anything larger it probably would be.  It's light and airy and also a little see thru in the sun üòë Also, was dissapointed that the seam is right down the center in FRONT! So the pattern doesnt match, right in front üò£ luckily it's a busy pattern and when you are moving around you really can't tell. Also, you could cut the tag off and wear backwards for a different neckline! Since it's inexpensive I'll keep it. But would gladly pay twice as much for thicker material and a seam in BACK!"
3.0,great for a 9 year old
3.0,Runs small; fabric thinner than expected.
3.0,"Way too big, fall off all the time! Seemed to be cushioning but they keep falling off so I'm done!"
3.0,"Price is good, but these are really thin. If you are buying them as a fashion accessory, perhaps be weary. I literally use them when riding the bus, or to tie my pants off when riding my bike and to wipe my face when sweaty."
3.0,Nice bras for price. Cups size fits perfect but the clasp straps are a bit tight might go up one size. To avoid the dreaded bra back fat!!!
3.0,"This dress is a lot bigger than I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, a muscular 150lbs, and I‚Äôm absolutely swimming in a large. They said to order a size up but it‚Äôs so much bigger than I imagined. Wish I had ordered a small!"
3.0,Cute lights. I'm glad I got 40. Some of them didn't work right out of the sack. Otherwise I'm satisfied. Price was good. Delivery excellent.
3.0,"Had they not pulled so much material back when sewing the buttons on it wouldve fit great, but the size runs small because of this drawback so I must return"
3.0,"This is a review for the purse, not the shoes lol. I like the purse but it is very stiff and hard to get things in and out. Other than that it‚Äôs cute but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt pay full price for it!"
3.0,It was much bigger than expected but served it's purpose. I would reorder in a smaller size.
3.0,"I think it‚Äôs a cute dress, just didn‚Äôt like it on me. I ordered a small but it seemed a little big. Fabric was nice though. Would recommend for others."
3.0,"One was not quite as white as the other four.  Not what I thought it was.  However, it serves the purpose for the time being."
3.0,"I purchased this and it was exactly what I was looking for. The colors are vibrant and bold yet classy (given that is purple/violet) however, the pieces are attached with stretchy string which broke after one wearing. I have a small wrist too! (6inches)"
3.0,I am large busted - I can't pull it to close. I am going to use it as a robe.
3.0,"The material wasn't exactly what I expected but seems strong and sturdy plus this way if anything spills it's an easy clean up, just takes a while to get used to the stiffness."
3.0,"scarf has a nice pattern, but scarf has a hole in it! asking for refund"
3.0,"The necklace is very beautiful. However, the class is too weak and the chain is too short. The necklace got tangled very easily and broke when I wasn't wearing it. When I did wear it fit me like a choker which is not the look I was going for"
3.0,Good earrings for an inexpensive purchase but looked too cheap for my own liking. The white edges shows that they are faux leather and adds to the cheapness of the look. Good for the price but returned since I wouldn't wear them realistically.
3.0,"Wore mukluks identical to these on the Plattsburgh AFB flight line just south of the Canadian border in the 70s. Worked great down to 10 deg but colder than that, and it often did get colder, they struggled to keep my feet warm even with liners. That's when I put on the &#34;bunny boots&#34;. If you don't live in the north tundra these will serve you very well. As stated they are not water proof."
3.0,"Ok, so based on the ruched style maxi skirt by this brand that i have purchased, I initially ordered a medium but the fit was too snug.  Large was out of stock, so took a chance on XL based on the medium's fit and the XL is good to go.  For reference I am 5'2"" ~155# hourglass shape.  The skirt is not too long - it goes past my ankles but i don't trip over it.  Also by other reviews, yes the pockets are weird, but hey the skirts do have pockets which is a plus.  Definitely recommend but maybe consider sizing up.<br />***Ok, so walking back a bit on my initial review... washed (cold water, gentle cycle, in mesh bag & hang dry) the red skirt and it seems to have stretched QUITE a bit in the waist and now I'm continually pulling this skirt up on my hips and the pockets are practically nonfunctional and ridiculous - i will not say what they remind me of :D .<br />Anyhow, I definitely prefer the ruched maxi by this brand and do not especially recommend this fold over band style from Isaac Liev - they should really go back and fiddle with this design to improve it.  Only reduced to 3 star because yeah Made in USA :) ***"
3.0,"The quality was good with this. The ties felt nice and silky. They were of a nice thickness. They came in a nice (not spectacular) box so they would be good to gift. We were very pleased with the quality.<br /><br />They darker tie was very nice. It was a pretty color. I thought it was very versatile. It had a nice sheen to it. My husband liked it a lot and it would also be nice as a gift.<br /><br />The problem was the other tie. It had the stripes, which I expected. I did not expect it to be sparkly. Literally sparkly. So it would be good for Christmas, perhaps, but both my husband and dad took one look and said they couldn't wear that. It really seemed to push into novelty. So I wish that was a little more of a standard tie.<br /><br />Overall great quality, just know what you are getting."
3.0,"I love the color I bought, but after wearing it i notice it‚Äôs heavy and it scratch me."
3.0,Did not fit for the size
3.0,"I did not like the fit of this mask, it made my eyes feel squish and it was not flattering for the style I was going for. However on the bright side my niece loves to play with it and her dolls are having fun with it."
3.0,"These jeans fit, that is, I can get them on but they look silly on my pear shaped size 16 body. The waist and hips ( surprisingly) fit fine. The legs are skin tight like sausage casing so that some fatty stuff bulges out from the distressed knee. Not attractive! And being as the fabric is very thin it shows up the bumps and bulges. Also, Standards & Practices are imported and I'm striving to buy American when possible. I also bought a pair of NYDJ jeans (Sylvia, boyfriend jean, made in USA) in the same order & they fit like they were custom made for me. I think I'll  stick with NYDJ jeans."
3.0,Very cute. I actually love the dress but it is very large and thank goodness I'm very short! Wouldn't recommend for anyone over 5'4&#34; unless you want to wear leggings.
3.0,"These shorts are cute and have the potential to be incredibly comfortable. I do feel that they run a little small so, I would suggest getting one size bigger."
3.0,"It seems as the sizes get larger for the dresses, tops, etc.  they are not flattering at all!!!"
3.0,"Well i guess i failed to read the reviews about how small this owl really is. I would say about the size of your little finger nail. It doesn't hang straight either, it drops toward on the chain. Maybe a wider chain andi t would sit straight on your neck line. Am on the fence as to whether to keep or send it back."
3.0,I really like the color. It‚Äôs very sheer but I like that factor. It‚Äôs running a little smaller than I expected so I guess I just have to lose a couple of more pounds before it looks perfect.
3.0,"I REALLY wanted to like this flower crown. I was going to use it for my maternity pictures, but 1. The flowers aren't as red as they are in the online picture, they're more pink in person. I have a wine color dress, so I wanted more of a red.. And 2. It is so big and bulky and just does not look right on my head. I'm hoping my photographer will be able to help me figure out a way for it to look nice in pictures, I definitely didn't want it to be the focal point lol! Other than that, The quality isn't bad, It is well made. No flowers have fallen off or anything. I think the leaves and flowers are a little too uniform though. Just something about it doesn't look right..."
3.0,"I thought this band was 3/4"" wide, but it's only 1/2"". When I went back to read the description again, they don't even show<br />the one that I bought. Way over priced."
3.0,"This is a good  product except for one thing. The flap that holds the insert into the wallet tore off within a week. I just took the first of the six pages and used that to hold the other five pages in the wallet so the product still works for me, and if I needed another, I would purchase it again."
3.0,Horrible fitting shirt but the collar is so cute I just cut it off and made into a dickey for my better Oxford lol. You get what you pay for!
3.0,"They seem to be good sunglasses so far however the color is deep purple, not navy which is disappointing as they are for a little boy!"
3.0,Like color didn't fit
3.0,"kind of poor quality, feels like 100% polyester so nonabsorbent socks :(  ....but the print is cute and price is cheap"
3.0,Not enough coverage over the bum.  Mine is not that big.
3.0,"The material is soft and drapes well. The color was more a maroon than a dark purple. Not a bad color just not as described.<br /><br />For me, the dress did not fit well. I am small chested and even in the smallest size with the tie cinched, the dress was too big and felt shapeless.<br /><br />I wanted to like this dress but it just wasn‚Äôt a good shape and style for my body."
3.0,These were amazing for the twenty minutes they stayed in one piece. I put my thumb through the herringbone the first time I went to the ladies room and had to trash them when I got home. I was highly disappointed since my regular spanx tights lasted be 3 years before needing to be replaced.
3.0,Dress is made of beautiful material and looks great. It‚Äôs not true to size . Need to order one size larger.
3.0,"Too long and very heavy, the quality was great, and they were very pretty!"
3.0,"Very cute but it looks like someone just took scissors to it to make it a crop top.  There is no hem. It rolls up and it has some fraying.  For the price paid, I expected better.  I was going to return it but my 8 year old really liked it."
3.0,Had these on my car for about 6 months now. Some of the LEDs have stopped working.
3.0,Don't order this cute dress unless you have the thighs to carry it off.  This dress is shorter than any other dress in my closet.  I limit to wearing around the house because I have lumpy thighs.  LOL<br />Landers well and is a very fair price.
3.0,"I kept this tho too small.  I need to wear a coat over it. Also, I got a light blue.  Not the royal blue shown on picture"
3.0,Light weight ‚Äúcheap‚Äù jacket. Doubt you would be saving this for a decades worth of use. This is a wear for a year or so product. The zipper‚Ä¶ weak‚Ä¶ have to be careful with it‚Ä¶ otherwise‚Ä¶
3.0,Super thin and see through. But fits well.
3.0,The earrings were pretty but the closures are flimsy and hard to use.  Some arrived already distorted.
3.0,"I‚Äôve been wearing this type of glove for years and have become somewhat of a snob. These gloves fall somewhere in the middle. Not the worst and not the greatest  I‚Äôve worn them while waiting for the train in 20 degree weather and my hands stayed warm. I also love the fact that you can expose your thumbs. This makes life so much easier, especially when using the phone. That being said,  my biggest problem with the glove is the thumb design.  The tips are constantly coming off my thumbs when i need them to be covered up- so frustrating in cold weather!  When I do want my thumbs exposed, there‚Äôs no way to keep the tips out of the way so they end up flapping around. Even as I type this I have to use my index fingers because the thumb tips would block my view of the screen.  A small piece of Velcro would‚Äôve prevented this problem.<br />Personally I would prefer if the gloves had a slit in the thumb so I could pop  in and out at will. I‚Äôm going to sew the thumb and tip together with a few stitches to see if it helps. I don‚Äôt hate the gloves but I‚Äôm definitely not in love with them either. I ended up purchasing a different pair and keep these in the car as a backup."
3.0,Wished it at least hit my feet. It went to my ankles. Material was thin so all together not worth the price.
3.0,The waistband is awkward making the cloth pull too much around tummy are and thus ride up.
3.0,Did not fit well for my husband but they work to block the sun just the same
3.0,"Shirt has an odd fit. If it's even a little too small, it doesn't lay right and looks terrible. It looked like it was possibly even sewn improperly on me (low plus-size), but it looked great on my mom, who had recently lost weight."
3.0,La negra es totalmente diferente a la mostrada en la publicaci√≥n.
3.0,"I'm a huge fan of STARGATE, and got this for fun.  When I compared it to the actual props from the series, it was somewhat similar, but definately not a studio replica.  Still, it's close enough that most people won't know the difference."
3.0,"I have 34DDD They hold the girls in and this is great for layering but if at any time you have to jump (which I did have to do) your whole boob comes out. So definitely this is just for show, that said I do wear this often just not if I have to move a lot. This is for lounging.<br /><br />Also why even bother putting in those little pads they are useless if you are going to put tiny hard triangles in there might as well skip that step so I don't have to put them in there."
3.0,"This thing was a tent when I got it- order a size down, not super flattering."
3.0,"I ordered plum, it‚Äôs black.  I‚Äôm ok if it is really deep dark plum, but it‚Äôs black."
3.0,"I was excited to receive these based on the awesome reviews. If you have average sized wrists,<br />DO NOT BUY. these are TINY. They are good quality and beautiful but the bracelet is so small it hurts my wrist to wear."
3.0,Better than what I expected for the price!!!
3.0,"Gorgeous dress!!! The material is unbelievable! However, I have a tiny upper torso/waist at 26in(maybe little less). I got the small and it needs to be taken in about 1inch. Also, it's not as fitting at the waist like I thought it was going to be. The skirt starts  mid rib.  I should've gotten the ds. For an Aline dress I can do a size 4. My hips are 42 and a 32D waist 26.<br /><br />I have received many compliments already."
3.0,"Excellent design, but the fabric is super weak and very transparent, unfortunately."
3.0,"i wore a medium for my gender reveal. i was 15 weeks pregnant. super flattering, no stretch though. the bottom is double lined but the top is not. my nude bra was showing, i opted to wear nipple covers instead."
3.0,"These shoes look fantastic, but would suggest a 1/2 size larger and buying some support insoles"
3.0,Nice outfit. Make sure the top will fit
3.0,I guess you get what you pay for? $6+ shipping.. it ripped in the crotch after 1 wear. It is seriously cute but material is flimsy. Hoping I can stich it back together since she received so many compliments.
3.0,Very soft but a little shrinking
3.0,The sweatshirt was too large.  The cool was great.  I would it again if It was in store and I could find the correct size.
3.0,"Cute but shows everything!  The fabric is extremely thin so it will even show a slip under it. So be prepared. I love the color and the fit but it is too long for me, I am going to exchange the large for a medium and see if that works better. Ideal if you are tall. I am not so he prepared for that or to hem the length."
3.0,Would be a five but it got lost and took a couple months to get. Good jewelry.
3.0,the flap that fits into the wallet needs to be stiffer. Didn't hold up very long.
3.0,"2nd pair, purely on the style/design that I‚Äôve been searching for work. Quality of plastic is very poor. Don‚Äôt expect top quality for a great price with these shades."
3.0,It looked ok not as bright as I thought it would be it's ok I'll wear it around the house.
3.0,"Dress had a hole in the back, not properly hemed."
3.0,It was nothing like the picture. The material was bunched up around the trim. The picture is beautiful. I‚Äôm not sure what happened. To straighten this jacket out it would need washed and the trim ironed heavily to stretch to fit the material. I think that would have fixed it anyway. Not positive. I just returned it.
3.0,"I ordered an extra small and it is huge on me. I do  not recommend it for a smaller frame. I am 5'0 and 105 lbs with 34B bra. However, I love the way this dress looks. I got the red and green one. If you do get it and you are small like me you will need to hem it forsure. But it is a beautiful style dress. I wish they made XXS size."
3.0,"The lace is great, but theres so much adhesive. There the tape, thanthe paper wrapping has adhesive, than the lace is tied with something rubber that left residue on the laces. Its a great lace but its not very Eco freindly."
3.0,Ordered two (different colors). They fit differently. The tan one was slightly too big. The grey was tight.
3.0,Bottoms fit as expected. Top did not provide much support but did fit.
3.0,"Cute, simple style, if not a bit boring.  The waist is a bit higher than natural waist.  Seam under bust is a little too high forcing you to tug down on the dress to fit under breasts.  I have never seen thinner material in my life.  I could see my watch through the fabric as I was slipping it on.  You would definitely need at least a half slip.  Flattering length.  Static and clingy when on, but that is easily remedied by putting lotion on your legs and panties.  Had a weird, chemical smell that would probably go away when aired out."
3.0,Very beautiful dress miss a few things but still love it.!
3.0,They are pretty but small.  The gears don't really show up at all as in the picture.
3.0,I was expecting the &#34;shorts&#34; part of the skort to be denim.  Instead it is a stretchy kind of shorts-like attachment that does not really provide the coverage and protection I was counting on.
3.0,Exactly like pictured.  I tired it on the baby and it keeps opening.  It won't stay on even when I tied a not. My grandbaby is 15 months. She kept the other one she had on just fine. The other one no longer fit her since she had it since she was born.
3.0,These do not appear thick enough to actually provide protection
3.0,"I had gotten a XXL as I seen people were saying to size up. I usually wear an Xl. Even the XXL is to tight. I could've went with a XXXl. Little disappointed but I can atleast fit it but its very tight. I am 210lbs 5'4"" and wear a 40 D in bra size incase others wanted a reference."
3.0,"My first issue with this purchase--and it's a big one for me--is that the seller offers a discount on future purchasesIF, AND ONLY IF, YOU LEAVE A 4 OR 5 STAR REVIEW FOR THIS PRODUCT. That is just a sleazy and dishonest tactic designed to artificially inflate positive reviews, and I make it a policy not to support sellers who engage in such behavior.<br /><br />That particular chip on my shoulder aside, this wallet is OK but kind of disappointing. It's far bulkier than expected, one of the sides doesn't unzip all the way down, and when zipped closed, the sides don't match (one zippered half of the wallet is flatter, and bulges out wider than the other half, detracting from the overall appearance).  I will send this back and instead keeping this wallet, which I prefer as it is cheaper, has more card slots, seems higher quality, and is much more compact, while fitting everything I need: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073CRNMPR/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_62"
3.0,Returned. Not what I was expecting. But it was nice material.
3.0,Leg length needs adjustment.
3.0,while the fit and feel are absolutely wonderful the seams are shit and in the crotch it wasn't even seamed in together.  I have had to hand stitch where seams and threads have been loose.  For the price it is what you expect tbh.
3.0,"Love this item, simple way of saying a lot. My partner loves it. My only fault though is at the end of the plate with the engraved words where the link bends...the edge there is rather sharp as it sticks up."
3.0,I may have the wrong size they seem to slide off and on at the heel!
3.0,Good socks but expensive
3.0,Not much leather 90% canvas
3.0,"This is for Cathy who was looking for a red metal watch band with double magnets. Try this one; you can find it right here on Amazon: ""ecband Magnetic Metal Milanese Loop Band"". It's a nice band, pretty color, fits well and even comes with instructions on how best to attach the band to your Apple Watch. Hope this helps."
3.0,"Quality was a tiny bit short of what I expected, but still he loved it."
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 , 140lbs I usually wear a medium and that‚Äôs what I got , the pants fit but the top is extremely small! Definitely recommend going a size up"
3.0,These are ok. They stretch out a lot so I'm glad I didn't investhink much in them. They don't go back to their previous state after stretching.
3.0,The earings are beautiful but they are definitively not for women . They are small sized. They show good quality but I did buy them thinking of them as gifts for I was lead to believe they were for grown-up ladies.
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and these stockings could be a couple of inches longer.  They are pretty warm also, but do a great job of making my legs feel better as a nurse on my feet a great deal."
3.0,I am disappointed it's not as cute as it was in the picture
3.0,"Really cool mask! I love that it can do so much. My only problem is that it shuts off quickly. Definitely doesn‚Äôt do the 500 rotations it claims to do in the description. Also seems to take forever to charge. Description said 4hours. I left it on charger overnight and still had issues. Not sure what‚Äôs up. But I‚Äôll take what I can get. I love creative stuff like this and even though it doesn‚Äôt work how described, I‚Äôm still the only person I know who has it and that makes it worth it."
3.0,"I love the color and structure. It has a sheen to it, very feminine. The size XL was too tight across the chest. I'm 5'4"" and wear a large top. The sleeves were a tad short, too. Therefore, I had to return it."
3.0,came broken and too loose
3.0,"They are nice and the shipping was ok.<br />I didn't have problem with the package and they were safe and protected.<br />I already used them on a flight Miami - Buenos Aires and they nailed it really good.<br />There is a problem with one of the wheels in the biggest one, it touches the &#34;boxy part&#34;, gets locked and it doesn't spin"
3.0,"These jeans are cute, but way too short. I bought them thinking they would be a bell bottom length that I could wear with wedges, but even when I wear sandals you can see my ankles. I am 5'6 and 165 pounds and ordered the size 10 and the waist fit perfectly. I would only recommend these if you are looking to wear them with sandals."
3.0,"Stainless steel is a wonderful product for jewelry for a multitude of excellent reasons. This product could have been better described regarding the cross totally separating from the shield, which is dangerous due to the sharp point on the cross. I found this very frustrating and intolerable and a pain (no pun intended) while being a deterrent to wear. Buy this product 'only' if you want to glue the heck out of it so it doesn't separate, then it looks wonderful. Now that I've glued it together with two different types of permanent glue, cleaning it up very quickly and polishing it immediately, this is one nice piece of jewelry. 3 stars because of poor separation design."
3.0,Cards are not easily removed without moving  other cards
3.0,Beautiful exactly like the picture except that it doesn't hang correctly
3.0,Nice variety a little small but I was able to make it work
3.0,"Fit well, but was too short for what I needed, and I already have a skirt in a similar color. Returned."
3.0,Be careful tends to lose its magnetic pull. Fell off in the airport
3.0,Was not as generous as it looked in the picture.
3.0,Wish it was a touch bigger. I really like the material and cut.
3.0,this was a good purchase. but I like for the belt to be TIGHT! making this belt tight leaves too much excess overlay.
3.0,Very Cute Kimono however it was a bit small for my taste!
3.0,"Love the look of this dress. It definitely ran big, I suggest going down a size. I hate strapless bras so I either had to wear a sweater or jacket over it or just show my bra. Overall, soft material and very comfy."
3.0,"My husband is 6'5 and I can't tell you what a pain it is finding undershirts long enough. A lot of his height is in his torso so even when things are labeled &#34;tall&#34; it's usually not the case. We have tried every brand available and jockey, stafford, Hanes etc all shrink TERRIBLE. I never dry them for that reason but of all the brands these have held the best. Minimal shrinking (wash cold,air dry) and have really held up well. Pricy but worth it."
3.0,The material feels very light.
3.0,The color is so gorgeous but I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô1 and I was totally drowning in it.
3.0,"Beautiful color. No give in the top. Definitely size up at least one size. Was looking forward to wearing it and loved saving money, but it's a miss."
3.0,"The material is of good quality, but it was just a little big around the waist area and the bow in center won't stay down so I had to stitch it down so it wouldn't look so awkward."
3.0,"It‚Äôs cute, runs just a little small in sizing but not too bad."
3.0,Will be returning it because you can't put it in the dryer. Need to hang to dry..
3.0,"I bought the largest size they had of this because I wanted some extra room for layers. It still fits, but I will not be able to do any layering. The 3xl fits more like an XL, or maybe a large. Runs very, very small. I'm doing three stars because I still like it, it's cute and exactly the warmth I wanted (definitely not a winter coat). Can't beat the price, also."
3.0,I was able to get full refund on this but when they came 3 of the balloons had holes in them and wouldn't hold air.
3.0,cheap chain
3.0,Material is very poor quality. Not worth the money.
3.0,First pair opened was cut incorrectly with a large chunk missing leaving them unwearable.
3.0,The product is a little thick when mixed with shampoo it is better. It causes flaking of the scalp must use a dandruff shampoo with it. It does thicken the hair when used.
3.0,The design was nice but the size was short
3.0,Cute and fuzzy.  Holds up for a year or two for Halloween and random wear throughout the year.
3.0,Beautiful shoes just taking my time getting used to them.  It was an impulse buy and I won't spent that much on sneakers again any time soon!
3.0,"I read the review and ordered size s, but the waist was still very large. I have fixed it by myself  and will enjoy it in coming winter!"
3.0,Liked it but it runs about 2 to 3 sizes smaller.
3.0,quality of the cloth is not good ..looks dull
3.0,"The material and construction are great, however the mask is way too small from nose to chin"
3.0,Way to big for my tiny wrist
3.0,the band tends to fold over after a few washes. Really like the fit in the thighs.
3.0,Runs a bit too small to be comfortable.
3.0,"Color as expected, large in the shoulders."
3.0,No very cooler
3.0,"The dress itself fit a bit large, I could have ordered 2 sizes down. But the main issue I had was that it was so long, it went halfway past my knees. Just not a good fit for me."
3.0,"I do not have a big head by any means but it takes a bit of fanangeling to get my head through. The bust area is a bit smaller then suggested for me as well. The quality of the material isn't the best, but for the price it'll do."
3.0,"This watch was just okay. I was looking for a watch that I could wear around the hospital and wouldn't care if it got dirty and this seemed like a good choice. However, the watch itself is very thick and this makes it stick out from my wrist too much. My biggest complaint about this watch though is that I can't see the numbers and letters clearly since it's so dim. I can only see the time and date if the watch it angled a certain way and that can get annoying if you're constantly checking the time or need to use your watch frequently. There are certain features that work well like the stop watch function or the alarm, but again, it's just very difficult to read the time. Even with the back light, which annoyingly only lasts about 2 seconds per press of the back light button, it's hard to see the time in the light or the dark. So, I wouldn't recommend this product mainly because it's hard to read the time. I will continue my search for a nice, easy to read, and affordable watch that I can use in the hospital. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,It‚Äôs more for an adult than a child. My son wanted it as he loves to watch CWC and it is too big on him. He‚Äôs 7.
3.0,"Two small, I could get it on nice stretch and wasn‚Äôt a cheep see through fabric but it was pretty thick and tight to uncomfortably to wear for outings the skirt came up pretty high because of my big beautiful butt. Wish it worked though."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f656fbde6ee5c7325d54af72eddbe685]] I personally didn‚Äôt like the way it fit my body shape. I‚Äôm 160lb, 5‚Äô1 and 40DD. So I went with the size large, but realized that was a mistake, because it fit wayyy too baggy on my body. But then on my chest, it was still showing a gap between the buttons. See video for more details<br />Also, I thought the color was not the same as the modeled pictures. I will say, the fabric is nice and satiny"
3.0,Looks nice but delicate one of the bands broke.
3.0,"The shirt was great! My daughter wore it a received many compliments. Unfortunately after one wash the lettering faded. I washed on the hand wash cycle turned inside out, but the lettering still faded."
3.0,"It's good quality, but it shows everything underneath, that you want hidden when you buy a night gown. Also, the bottom fabric is irritating."
3.0,lots of stuff. didn't really meet my needs as i was looking to have backs on looped earring going through my gauges.
3.0,Pretty but not solid<br /> Wore it one week. Charm came off & hook don't work. I will return for a refund
3.0,"I had some old salwars that were wearing out, so I took a chance to order these in bright pink, navy, and black. The colors are perfect, the stitching and finishing are professional, but the size guide is a very generous one. I am not one to just ""buy my normal size,"" and I do rigorously check the actual garment measurements with size charts provided for every online purchase I make, so I was surprised to find that this did NOT fit - far too tight around the waist for me, despite getting 2 sizes larger than I would normally purchase. Moreover, unfortunately at 5'7"" these ended up being shorter than I had expected. I will be keeping them and hoping to lose weight... If you are shorter than me and get the right size, you will be VERY pleased with the quality of the fabric, the sewing and finishing."
3.0,"These moccasins are good looking and appear to be well made. However, they run a bit small. My husband was unable to get his usual size on his feet."
3.0,Love the style but very loose fitting on face
3.0,"It's exactly as pictured, however, it just seems a little basic. The design, fit, and material are all just OK. I wear a size 22 dress and the xxl was nowhere close to fitting. It's perfect for a costume, but if it's a piece you want to keep and wear to multiple events, buy something else."
3.0,"It's good because it have two purse in one, but mine came stained."
3.0,Doesn't fit to well and and the adjustable ear straps on the side are to  tight
3.0,"It's a cute pajama set. Ordered a size up so it would fit on the looser end for comfort. Good thing I did, a medium would have been too tight.  The pants are see through FYI. Wish the material was cotton."
3.0,"I gave these 3 starts because I could not get them over my foot! Very undersized. However, they were perfect for my 2 year old granddaughter... üòìüòì, And she loves thent!"
3.0,The fit was it like the one in the photo. Good material just not the best fit for me.
3.0,"The socks are very thin and comfortable for the most part, but there is a stamp embossed with the size on the underside of the socks, which you can feel on the soles of your feet. I did get used to it after a while though."
3.0,"My daughter loves it, specially because it is Shimmer and Shine. The goggles are just ok, the pain is that the elastic band always get loose and I have to be constantly fixing it."
3.0,I really LOVED it... till the strap broke on my vacation. I had to buy a new purse.
3.0,The magnet came loose while on my bra and I lost the Fitbit. Thank goodness it was in my house and I eventually found it. I have 2 other brands and the magnets were stronger. I will still use it but only inside pockets so that I feel more secure about keeping my Fitbit safe.
3.0,I liked the colors on the scarf .It is okay .
3.0,"They were pretty, but a little expensive for the product."
3.0,Purchased for my 4yr old . True to size however they do not look all that great. Velcro comes undone easily. I will not buy again
3.0,The zipper broke on 2 of the bags as I was packing. Very cheap quality. The other 2 bags were okay and I was able to keep my belongings somewhat organized during my trip to 3 cities in 6 days. Nice color.
3.0,"The size fits as expected. So don't listen to anyone review, if it doesn't fit you it means that you wear different size.<br />The only thing that I didn't like is the material.Very cheap and poorly made!"
3.0,"I bought this in a large because other reviewers said to size up. I am a 34 D or a 32DD and would normally have bought a medium. The cups fit ok, but I found the straps way too loose for my liking  and I had to do some adjustments to make it fit. Keep in mind that if you have a narrow back like me but a larger cup size, this may not be a good fit for you if you size up. I can imagine had I bought a medium I might have spilled over<br /> because the size large just fit in the cup. Overall, this bra looks good in a lot of low cut shirts. It gives that plain shirt you may have in your closet just a little bit of pizzazz, but I took away stars for a low quality design."
3.0,"Overpriced, found same glasses for $100 less"
3.0,Dress was a good fit but a lot shorter(about calf length) than the black and white option so I chose to return. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 165lbs 34DDD (in Victoria‚Äôs Secret bras) and I ordered a M and a L and the medium fit Best.
3.0,"The functionality if the band is great and it matched my Fitbit well, but the color is coming off and I have not had it that long."
3.0,"When the bottom portion is folded upward as the photo depicts it becomes quite small, while leaving it all the way unraveled makes me look somewhat like a bishop."
3.0,"I previously purchased a similar item with a silver, dressier band. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076KKWRHC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />It was gorgeous - so much prettier than I expected. I wanted to get this less dressy bracelet with the black band for a teen girl. The jewel/colored didn't seem as nice or smooth as the silver band I bought. It was okay, but not as nice."
3.0,"Estas correas son bonitas, pero tienen un defecto al ponerlas, no entran con facilidad üòû"
3.0,not bad for this price!
3.0,"Not accurate size, toooooo small"
3.0,Looked really cute but I am convinced the hook part did not hold unto my bag strong enough and I lost my keys the other bight.
3.0,"These are not real crystals. The necklaces seem ok, but are definitely not real ""healing"" stones. Just colored glass or maybe even plastic. They all come in a plastic siplock type bag so I wouldn't really say giftable unless you were to package nicely. Maybe for a younger child, definitely not for someone really in to stones."
3.0,Es muy peque√±a me he tenido que acostumbrar a llevar mi celular tarjetas y llaves
3.0,Looks great! But it was very very hard to see while wearing it
3.0,"These are very small, I lost the ball on one, and gave up on the other... Go to a piercer to get them put in, because it's a headache doing it yourself."
3.0,"Im normally a large in H&M, I order an XL to be safe even when people had comments of it fitting as expected.<br /><br />It's way too tight and I cannot wear it. Also am an average height person 5'5 and it's way too short for me, I would have a to wear it with leggings as a long shirt.<br /><br />The product does have good quality though, just make sure you order 2 sizes up."
3.0,Cute dress. Looks good on but the material is a very thick ugly polyester. Like old women pants from the 80s but thicker!
3.0,No problem with the quality of the sweater.  Have washed and used the dryer to shrink it a little..they however sent me the wrong design.
3.0,Arms are very big. If I ordered again I would size down one size.
3.0,Was excited to finally see what this boot looks in person after our shipping problems.  Am really glad it turned out well.  The boot is a little snug but will do.  Had to put a special arch support padding for a more comfortable fit.  It's an ok purchase.
3.0,"Loved the idea of this shirt, but too much extra material but too small across the bust."
3.0,One of the expensive ones and works quite well but not in all situations. Had trouble in deep clear lakes which were not any better than without them.
3.0,"Good fit, only the pockets are disappointing. They run on the small size and tear easily. Hard to keep a phone or even keys in there."
3.0,"I love this one. It‚Äôs so cute and comfortable, and fits like a glove‚Ä¶I only took off one star because it‚Äôs shorter than I thought, and I got a few odd glances at work. Great for a party, or a night out."
3.0,Gorgeous but . . . . .the frame and handle are different colored metal.
3.0,Dress was short and I'm 5' 4. Had to return.
3.0,"Great price for a coat, but it wasn't flattering so it went back."
3.0,"Love the price point, and sending these as gifts to my team that are stationed all over the US. Unfortunately one pair of earrings had a printing defect. But I only needed 18 pairs."
3.0,"I liked the style of this top, but the body of the garment is a different material and did not exactly match the satin sleeves.  If you want it to be exact, then this is a problem.  It is okay, but for the pricing I felt it could be better quality.  I returned the item."
3.0,very nice material - very fits like it looks in the picture
3.0,"It works, but it looks and feels more like a cheap Halloween custom article."
3.0,"This is A REALLY BIG mask, which is great if you have a big face, I guess. But I can't get it to fit right with my glasses & everything. Very pretty, though."
3.0,"Wish it was longer, but fits pretty good"
3.0,I normally love this brand but this fit is a little different than the others.
3.0,They are good for lawyering or to wear at home. Comfortable but showing some wear after a few months.
3.0,"I'm an xl to 1xl and I couldn't even fit my arms in it. I also bought their long dress version, that one fits perfect. Guess both dresses aren't made similar ways."
3.0,It's a nice piece of costume jewlery but if you were looking for something to catch the eye. I would purchase something more expensive.
3.0,"The belts are nice, however, there was a musty scent, like they were damp when packaged.  The brown belt wasn't as long as the others and was missing a hole."
3.0,"Original Review: Disappointed - design not clear like those shown in pictures by other reviewers. Looks like one big blur.<br /><br />Follow-up Review: Talk about top notch service. I recently wrote a review explaining that I had a concern about this recent purchase. Well, NinaQueen not only read the review, but they reached out to me and offered assistance. It is truly a rarity to have a seller initiate, offer, and provide such outstanding  customer service. I am truly impressed with NinaQueens outstanding customer service and willingness to resolve customer concerns.  They truly care about their customers and take great care in ensuring that their customers are satisfied with their products. I was offered a replacement bead that was different, but extremely beautiful. I am truly impressed with NinaQueen and will continue purchasing their beautiful charms."
3.0,"I love the color and the slinky feeling material but although I like my sleep wear to be big, this is way too big!"
3.0,Nice size but a few pulled pieces of fabric
3.0,"It is a beautiful peace and my daughter loves it. However, the magnet on the necklace doesn't keep the piece shut. My daughter loves it so much she doesn't want to return the piece, she wears it open."
3.0,Though the edges don't come up like an umbrella as pictured... it still does the job keeping hair off the floor.... sometimes...
3.0,Had to return it because it was too short.
3.0,I would definitely buy a size larger than you need.  Very flattering and comfortable.
3.0,They are nice gloves but one size does not fit all as they are just a smidge too small for me.
3.0,Had to return. It runs very small.
3.0,I love lapis lazuli and use it to make beautiful jewelry. This piece was not the quality stone or workmanship I expected. The price was right.
3.0,So much smaller than expected. Gave away to young niece.
3.0,theyre alright but they are like 1 big old elastic band around your waist.. they keep my p[ants up but i feel like i have to stretch it around my waist
3.0,"Very thin, feels like it‚Äôs made of some type of sponge"
3.0,"Felt like skinny jeans! Too small in waist, thighs, and calf area. The boot cut out was nice though"
3.0,They fit fine as described on the size chart. However; the quality was not all that great.
3.0,Pretty colors but runs small. Had to return
3.0,"My kids LOVE Undertale!!!  So I wanted to give a thorough review on the sizes since so many have complained about it.  Let's have some perspective? :)  I purchased a pink set and a yellow set, and here's what I found.  I ordered an XL pink for my daughter.  She's ten-and-a-half, 4'11"" and around 90 lbs.  She wears a size 14 (XL) to fit her or a 16 (XXL) to have a little room/to grow.  The XL we ordered was the PERFECT size for her!  She has an athletic build, similar to a gymnast.  It's actually big enough to fit me (I'm 5' 3"").  The yellow set was for my son and we got him a Large.  He's nine-years-old, 4'4"" and about 60 lbs.  He's tall and skinny!  An 8 fits him and a 10/12 is baggy.  The set is big enough that it will fit him now but it's definitely large, so there's room to grow as well.  The sleeve length doesn't have room to be baggy, if that's the look you like; however, it is long enough to cover their arms AND their wrists.<br /><br />The fabric is very thin and I'm nervous to wash them because the print seems extremely delicate.  I think I may have to hand wash/spot wash/take to the dry cleaners and let them figure it out???  But other than that my kids are super happy about these and can't wait to wear them when school starts!"
3.0,"These leggings are unquestionably warm and comfortable, but they began noticeably pilling after two washes.  They'll work for lounging at home, but I can't wear them out any more."
3.0,It is too faky because of the size of the stone.  It would have been pretty real if the stone was slightly smaller.
3.0,Its not cut right . it rises up at the bottom.
3.0,"Usually this product fits me like a clove but maybe it was the material on this one. But it was very loss around the collar, tight around the waist and big everywhere else. Have to return it. But I still love this company's clothes. Just this one was not a winner."
3.0,"Nice but I had to return, the sleeves were too small for me"
3.0,Sleeves are cut too small in width
3.0,Three bonnets for a low price is unbeatable. Over time the headband does stretch out and the bonnets slide up but nothing a few stitches my sewing machine can't fix. I wish for more colors.
3.0,it  ok for the price would not buy again
3.0,It really pretty but the smell is awful like kerosene and mothballs
3.0,Really liked these until the seams started coming apart. Real bummer :(
3.0,Masks do not fit adults without smashing your nose. Very close fit. Material hard to breath out of.
3.0,Kind of hurt my ears but I still like the look
3.0,"Feels stiff, but it‚Äôs okay."
3.0,To small around the arm
3.0,It was a little too large.
3.0,"I wear a small, and I bought a small. Fits well but the pattern on the shorts doesn't match up on each side. It looks weird because of it the pattern being off. I will still wear the suit but I wish the pattern was the same as in the pictures."
3.0,It's poor quality material
3.0,"Seemed a bit cheap, but nice otherwise!"
3.0,"Got these for my boyfriend and I for Valentine's day. His broke within a week, mine is still holding on. His broke just gotta ng in and out of his pocket. I guess if you just want them somewhere they won't be messed with often then it's great. But if you are more active, they aren't tough enough"
3.0,"We bought my daughter's current size in these and they're a bit big.  I've put them on a shelf to use later.  A caveat: they don't look like they'd be easy to clean.  For $49 kid shoes I'd expect better/more easily cleanable materials to be used.  My daughter does like the colors though, and she's picky about her things in general."
3.0,Scratchy amd too tight even though the other two bras I purchased that were similar were  smalls and the sizing chart for this one said I should get a small. I will unfortunately have to donate this since t is so uncomfortable and I am outside the return window. This inside of this particular brand has a mesh and seams that rub. I checked my other one and it has 1 panel of a much softer mesh.
3.0,Super cheesy looking. I‚Äôve had 3mm stones before so I knew the size but these look extra tacky and fake.  You get what you paid for.
3.0,The dress quality was ok but the size didn't fit what we expected. This XL ain't XL
3.0,I'm 5'2&#34; 140lbs and I ordered a 9 I could barely get into. Go up a size!
3.0,Fit closely i should have chosen the extra large
3.0,"These earrings are very trendy and some of them are really pretty.  Despite that, there are several pairs that are so cheap looking,  that they immediately went in the trash.  I didn't like the shorter pairs with the rhinestone posts.  They looked horribly cheap.  I also didn't like the 4-tiered pairs.  They were a mess and I couldn't imagine wearing them.  The others are really cute. You may have to trim some of them,  because the tassels may be uneven. There's a great assortment of colors to choose from."
3.0,"Great Great gorgeous dress..thick enough to warm you up..it fits loose on the top..which I can manage but the ""curve "" of the hips goes down to my mid leg and yet short dress up to my knees..doesn't make sense..<br />I ordered a large since I usually wear that..I'm 5'0 , 150..<br />I wanted to get a medium size but it will not arrive until next January..so sad and disappointed üòû"
3.0,Not actually indestructible. Bought these to prevent bullets from getting in my eyes during saloon shootouts.<br />Terrible idea. The sunglasses are already ruined.
3.0,I liked these but they did feel a bit more snug than what I expected. I'm a bit worried about the fit after a couple of washes if they already fit tight. The designs are nice and I like the fabric. They did ride up when I moved a lot so I'm not sure who thought to advertise them as briefs  that don't ride up when that can be proven wrong soon as you wear them. I'm not so disappointed that I'd try to get a refund. I just thought I'd let future consumers know because if you're buying these specifically for that then these aren't for you. If you're worried about the fit then buy a size larger than normal because they run smaller. If you're buying them because they look nice then you're good.
3.0,The fabric is not comfortable
3.0,The quality is very good but this shirt runs way too small.  My 14 yr old daughter wears a small to medium in woman's shirts so I figured I'll order a large to give her some growing room but the large barely fits her.  Needed to order an XL.
3.0,The item was returned
3.0,I am bummed out this is clearly misses/teen size not Women‚Äôs and it even said so on the packaging when I received it.<br /><br />All in all great material but I am a size 16/18 and there is no way this will cover 42D bust even with the stretch it has.<br /><br />Keep in mind when ordering to order up a size.l as it is misses/teen size.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
3.0,Great product but because of one size fits all....It doesn't firt
3.0,"I've owned these boots in eggplant for over a year, ordered from a different website. They are beautiful and fancy, look exactly like the picture. At this price, I was expecting the quality to be 110%. Not quite. Pay attention, the bottom of the soles have no traction and therefore dangerous in icy conditions.<br />Also the soles are a lot heavier than other shoes, making them tiring to wear. The shoes would favor a narrow foot. There is no cushioning and I wanted to put insoles in them to make them more comfortable but there is not enough room. The heels are also starting to wear out way faster than I would expect. Better made boots at this price would last a decade a more. I really wanted to love them. I do get complimented on them a lot, but they are a disappointment for being uncomfortable, heavy and not durable."
3.0,They are a little too dark and as flimsy as they look.
3.0,The material isn't what I expected.  It feels like a material that is going to snag on everything.
3.0,"The wooden beads are much bigger in diameter than I had thought.  They do not easily fit under a collar.  I love the colors, but it's just bulkier than I had anticipated."
3.0,The adjustable strap is unnecessary and awkward.
3.0,Way to big for a regular watch this is for a big male watch.
3.0,"the quality of the product is disappointing, loses elasticity very quickly"
3.0,"Too large in the bust and very low cut. Too tight in the waist. I am 5'8"" 153 lbs."
3.0,"This arrived in a timely manner. The black paint came off on my hands immediately when I pulled it out of the bag and I had to wash the bowl with soap and water. Washing it took the paint off in spots and the striker is also smudged with the black paint.<br />I can make it sing with the wooden side of the striker easily but not on the suede side.<br />For a beginner, it's ok but I would have been embarrassed to give this as a gift. It's adequate for entry level and personal use. I'm not going to send it back but I wouldn't have bought it if I had known the paint would come off."
3.0,"Logo good quality, t-shirt material is not good quality. I usually fit fine into Girl‚Äôs large or xlarge. This time I didn‚Äôt but good thing my daughter is thin enough to wear and like it."
3.0,Good sweatshirt but yes somewhat o the large side would prefer a little smaller fit
3.0,To small but cute
3.0,"The shoes are comfortable and I really like their looks - BUT - this is my second pair.  I ordered the first  pair through Belk in August and within a month they were falling apart.  The sole on the right shoe had come loose and I glued it back but the trim wore out/pulled loose and could not be fixed.  I ordered these hoping that the first pair was just a fluke and so far, they are holding up but I just got them Nov. 21st.."
3.0,A needed item
3.0,The caps run small. If you have thick or long hair it want work.
3.0,The pants go on with out problems and are very comfortable but I can't stand the waist part keeps rolling down. I ordered 3 and the same with each one so that was money down the drain
3.0,This light blue scarf is exactly as pictured. It is very thin and light weight. It is also ok for the price.
3.0,No me gusto para nada en la imagen se ve m√°s cool la tela es muy pesada deber√≠a se mas ligera para un camis√≥n
3.0,I was so excited when I ordered this shirt and bummed when I got it in. The material was soft but shirt was more of a medium instead of an xl
3.0,Love this but backing came out and is lost after third wearing!
3.0,You get what you paid for. The lense fell out after months of use. Looked very cute but ain‚Äôt the sturdiest one.
3.0,"Not as pretty as picture. Glass is not very opaque. Setting plain, not, like the picture. Cheap."
3.0,"Get what you pay for, 80's flashback, not a &#34;blue&#34; lens, it's coated"
3.0,"My son has already broken two of them from trying to put on the shoe.  The plastic part that goes in each of the holes broke off just from holding the tongue of the shoe up to slip his foot inside.  Thankfully there were extras so we replaced the with the leftover ones.  Also the rubber oval that is in the middle of each band continuously pops out and are lost.  So each ""lace"" looks like it has a hole in the middle."
3.0,It‚Äôs ok ... not great...
3.0,very good value for its flimsy construction
3.0,"These chino shorts are a little too thin. Since the material is thin and light, everything causes wrinkles. The material itself is also pretty rough, so it‚Äôs not particularly pleasant to wear. Also M size runs small, so it‚Äôs better to take one size up."
3.0,It's loose & comfortable. A good all-purpose sweater.
3.0,Very cute . I wore for Christmas and lost one. They fell out easy. Maybe some of those little clear backings could work
3.0,The shirt  runs a little large but can be worn off one shoulder I guess if you like that look.
3.0,Had an odd smell. Had to hand wash with Dawn to keep smell from getting into my pocketbook.  Very happy with it after the smell was eliminated.
3.0,"Ordered a large, but unfortunately it was still to small. The quality is far and delivery time is good."
3.0,"I am 5'2 and I bought a medium. While it does fit perfectly, it is way too long on my legs and torso. I have to fold the top of the skirt down once and fold the top up, and even then it is too big. It is cute, IT IS SEE THROUGH! But I will be returning this."
3.0,It's smaller than I anticipated. Skin tight. It's also shorter than I'd like. I like them a little longer. They are silky shiney. I don't prefer that type of material.
3.0,My husband bought this for Halloween because he just really likes the movie ...he really loved the mask im just not that impressed it's very cheaply made ... the hair which is not hair but im pretty sure yall know what i mean was so soft you barely touched it and you could see where your fingertips were ..it's very cheaply made ..it fit my husband perfect he's excited about it but I would pay 100 for the mask the price is just ridiculous
3.0,"This watch was too small and no other pieces were sent it with it. I‚Äôm not a big man either, 5‚Äô10 and 185 lbs. so beware when you order this you obviously have to be a small man! Returning it and will order a different watch."
3.0,"Above average leather quality is about the only real praise I can give to this jacket due to its incredibly odd fit. The jacket itself ends almost above my belt line, while the sleeves go way down past my thumbs. Some serious tailoring would be required if I were to keep this thing, but considering the price I already payed, I just don't think it's worth it."
3.0,a little stiff around ankles
3.0,Cheap quality but also cheap price. It fits smaller than it should.
3.0,looks just lit the pic
3.0,I thought it was black with a pink pocket ( color is different in computers) but it's a light charcoal grey. Won't match my luggage but will still be useful.
3.0,I ordered three sizes bigger and it fits a touch smaller than the look pictured.  Beware.  The print and colors are as pictured.
3.0,"The shirt runs a little small compared to other shirts in the same size, otherwise its a nice shirt"
3.0,It is running slow already. Just got it. Will have to take it in for a new battery.
3.0,Material is really thin and see thru. Makes a great kick around/run errands dress but not for work.
3.0,The suit looked and fit awesome. Only problem is the stitching came loose on the back. Going to try and repair myself I guess.
3.0,"For the price you pretty much don't expect perfection. There are 4 Houses (Ravenclaw,blue) (Grifandor,Red) (Hufflepuff,yellow) Slytherin,green) They only added 3 of the 4 colors and that was a bit upsetting. The purchase pic showed all 4 and ai was excitwd. not so much now."
3.0,"Like most everything these days, this is cheaply made in Mexico. They iron a team logo on the front, and then charge 3 times what it's worth."
3.0,"Not brand that was advertised.  Neck and attached tags say Velrose.  Blue is very lightweight and fairly see through.  If that's what you want you will be happy.  Seems well constructed but will probably return. Doesn't feel like its the quality of a Shadowline gown, which I have had several of and liked, hence my purchase of this one. Length is as shown and sized appropriately."
3.0,It is tight on foot and little bit big.
3.0,"The price point is right down the middle, so is the anklet. It‚Äôs meh. Looks cute. Fit well. Meh."
3.0,My son loves them and they are cute but they do run small order a size bigger
3.0,"I have a big head.  2 stars for me, 3 for the hat"
3.0,This rompers was way small fit.more like a 12m it was an 18-24m
3.0,"This bra seems awesome. The material was soft and looked extremely comfortable. Unfortunately it was just too small for me. I normall wear an xl in shirts and hoped it would fit me, but the sizing listing seems to be true to fit, this was definitely too small for me. But the quality of the bra appeared really nice and I wanted it to work."
3.0,Looks as expected. The hook that goes into the belt holes is a bit sharp.
3.0,"I'm not crazy about these.  Bigger than what I wanted, and flat."
3.0,Super cute but they fall off all the time.
3.0,"Very unique style and flimsy, knit material, better suited for dress down or even a bathing suit cover up. I was so confused, from the pictures, I thought it looked like a dressy dress.<br /><br />I actually ordered it to wear to a funeral. Even with a slip, this is not appropriate. It‚Äôs made of of such a thin fabric, it‚Äôs better suited for summer wear.its a pull-on over your head style. It does have a gathered section on one side; this is where it‚Äôs a little odd. This scrunched design in the side is not very flattering. It leaves the rest of the dress just hanging.<br /><br />It is machine washable, recommend to use cold water, no bleach and do NOT use clothes dryer. Best to hang dry. With this in mind, it‚Äôs a pretty decent material to travel with. No wrinkles.<br /><br />Summary:<br />* 95%Viscose 5% Elastane<br />* Pull on closure<br />* Crew neck, short sleeve, solid loose fit long dress<br />* Machine Washable, cold water; Do not bleach, cold iron and hang dry"
3.0,Material was not very nice or comfortable. A bit small as well
3.0,brim looks a lot wider in the photograph
3.0,"For the price I wasn‚Äôt expecting too a high quality product, which was accurate. The leggings are thin. The red wasn‚Äôt deep as indicated in the photo but more of a red orange. I wore them under my Santa dress, but would probably not wear them if my backside wasn‚Äôt covered!"
3.0,Its kind of small its a tight fit! It looks funny on the lil ones but it does the job...
3.0,Fit okay and are thin
3.0,Some of the rings already came turned tarnished and the rest were good.
3.0,They run small I prefer a size bigger
3.0,"I got a size small and it was loose. There's no support. You can tie back the bust area, but it wasn't enough."
3.0,"I went by the size chart  got a medium it loose  not body hugging  next time i will buy small like i should have i am almost 5""  and  weigh 122 lbs"
3.0,"They are OK.  The glasses look decent enough but the lenses do sit at an odd angle..like turned up.  So much that even my family noticed it the first time I wore them.  From a quality standpoint, they are what you'd expect for a cheap pair of sunglasses.  I tried them because they were just that...cheap.  But honestly after receiving them, it seemed they spent more attention to packaging, the case, etc. then they did on making a good quality product."
3.0,"This was such a cute suit, but the ruffle was too tight around the arms and the bodice was too long. Also, the fabric was thin and belly button showed through."
3.0,It's too baggy to be flattering. It's loose in all the wrong places and looks like an under inflated balloon. It doesn't help that you can't wear a bra with it
3.0,Chest area a bit smaller than expected
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, unfortunately it did not fit me :( The chest is tight and makes the dress extremely short."
3.0,Is a great jacket for the price!! Really like the vintage look it has
3.0,I thought it would be like a sweatshirt.  Kind of a weird fabric that gets dirty easily but my kid still lives it cause it's unique and he loves lions
3.0,"I like this shirt, but it is very sheer! I hate when shirts are like this. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend more money on undershirts, especially to only be able to wear a shirt like this. It‚Äôs a bit annoying and I don‚Äôt get why it is so difficult to make a shirt that isn‚Äôt see through."
3.0,"Nice skirt but too big for me, got an S and still fits huge."
3.0,Sleeves are tight.  I ordered a size up and it's almost too small. The material is ok.
3.0,"I was happy with the product when I purchased them for Christmas for my husband. They were fun colors and in the style he likes. It's not even 3 months later and they are ripping at the seams, and it's not a sizing problem, they just don't last for someone who is athletic. It's not over use either because he has enough boxer briefs to go weeks without laundry. Perhaps if you're not an active person these will last longer, if not, spend your money elsewhere and get something that will last longer."
3.0,"I mean... the dress I ordered is not the dress I got in the mail... and by the time I realized it, it was too late. I like the dress I have but I was a little annoyed because that‚Äôs not what I actually ordered. It fits snug, even when getting a size up from my usual. But I guess it‚Äôll work."
3.0,It was soft and breathable but was very large on my face so I'm not sure if it's doing any good
3.0,"Run small. This is my sons exact size and they were too tight for him. Despite being stretch - still did not work. College kids like their pants loose anyway, so designers need to keep that in mind. There was no way these would fit him as a &#34;relaxed fit&#34; jean. The color and fabric was nice. Stitching fine too, but neither son, nor mom cared for the 1 slit knee cut. It's not really a distressed look to just slice the knees. If one slice is stylish enough for you, then go for it. I thought it would be, but when in hand, changed my mind. Amazon price is currently at $78 and that seems a spec high for what you receive - even if you order a size up. If on sale, and you order up... could be a good deal."
3.0,These shoes are attractive and my son said they are comfortable. They wore out too quickly.
3.0,Wish the earring hook was longer!  I want to put stops on them so  I  very don't lose them!!!!!!!!!!
3.0,Top especially runs large but expected given the size range. Getting another one in a smaller size.
3.0,Bought these to help Child keep glasses on head.<br /><br />Glasses are off head.<br /><br />So didn't really work for the intended purpose.
3.0,Ladies these leggings are super flattering for working out they feel very well made however for me personally I ordered an XL but I think I should‚Äôve ordered an XX large They are super snug and I ordered four different fabric patterns of these Leggins so I‚Äôm super pumped for my weight loss journey for these to fit me perfect so just keep in mind when ordering these Leggins to order a size up they are very true to fit
3.0,Very nice but very lightweight not appropriate for winter
3.0,Skirt is beautiful and very colorful. However it's way too much material for my short self. If the skirt was a bit slimmer I would keep the skirt..
3.0,Was a gift for some friends. The kids loved them. However one of the toboggan lights didn‚Äôt work
3.0,"It's actually what I expected in a work out shirt. Extremely light weight and loose fitting (I ordered up 1 size). But it's not name brand and its not something I'm going to write home about. Very hard to review on a 5 star scale. I would say for the price and what you get it's actually pretty good, but compared to some similar workout shirts I bought recently at target, definitely don't like it as much."
3.0,It is a very soft fabric but it is not cotton
3.0,Awesome shoes!! Creative design! But about 1/2 size too big üò©
3.0,A little clingy.
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù , 170 (half muscle half fat. I look 140/150) i got a large. My thighs are mighty. It‚Äôs cute for lounging but this WILL ride up and you‚Äôll pull them down all day. It‚Äôs not for walking!"
3.0,I ordered a 2XL and normally wear an XL. Because they were very clingy they looked unattractive. This would be a nice shirt for a person who isn't concerned with showing every ripple in their skin. I really wanted to like these and had ordered 6 different colors. Returned them all.
3.0,It's very light weight but the fit is not as cozy as other Nike caps
3.0,The magnets came out of the bracelets which I can say pathetically I‚Äôm glad for because originally the magnets repelled each other instead of coming together
3.0,I really like the outfit but after one wash this is how it came out. Now I'm out of money and an outfit.
3.0,"Poofy, check.  Layers, check.<br />Pro - elastic waistband that separates and ties for extra stay power<br />con - velcro likes tulle, underskirt is a tad longer than last layer"
3.0,"This looks quite a bit bigger in the photo, but when it arrived I see that it is actually about the size of your thumbnail‚Ä¶. So small, that you just about have  to have a magnifying to read the inscription on it‚Ä¶"
3.0,"It fits as expected, but the neckline is very high, it looks a little weird.  But it fits and I needed another casual dress for grab and go so I'll keep it.  the print is cute."
3.0,my kids always loose there glasses so they are cheap and well build. I will by them again if I need to replace the ones.
3.0,It‚Äôs ok. For my face it does accumulate moisture and my mask slides on them. I can breathe better but as a teacher having to wear them all day it becomes a little uncomfortable.
3.0,"I bought these as ""run around"" purses. Something that could get beat up and I wouldn't care. They are nice enough but one of the tags say ""luxury at an affordable price."" Affordable yes, luxury no. I'm still not completely sure if these are real leather. There is a leather smell, but for all I know it's a spray. I have leather handbags, boots and jackets and none of them are as thin and pleather like as these. They are decent for the affordable price, but not luxurious."
3.0,The material was very good not thin and not see thru but it was jus too big! I had to return. I normally wear medium and felt like I can go 2 size down
3.0,"Although the ties serve their purpose for holiday events, they are really thin material, and would not hold up with continued use. Price is great though for occasional wear events"
3.0,Romper fit me a little too lose and big for my liking and I got a small. I‚Äôm normally a small. I returned
3.0,It's a pretty ring but the center of the flower is slightly raised and catches everything
3.0,The band works and was easy to install. However the adjustment strap is just a touch too wide for the buckle making it a bit of a struggle to put it on. Also the small band on the buckle side that holds the excess adjustment band is a bit too loose and can slide off under the stress of a golf swing. It will be interesting to see how this holds up over time.
3.0,I thought tis would be a little smaller.  Quality is just okay.
3.0,Returning it because it was needed for a party but the other item I needed to go with it did not arrive on time.
3.0,a few of them have already broken :(
3.0,"Cute, nicely made but the strip between toes hurt and rubbed, very irritating or maybe to short."
3.0,Not horrible. Order a size bigger. I normally wear XL but the shoulder part keeps going up so maybe a size bigger would of worked. Plus the shirt isn't as long as it shows in the pic.
3.0,"Eh. It's ok. It's actually larger than I thought, which I was really scared it'll get in the way or get caught by something. A little heavier than I thought too, but the design is pretty cute!"
3.0,Tight around waist but loose around bottom. Overall just not particularly flattering.
3.0,The material is comfortable enough. But the gold emblem and bands on the sleeves are made of a really poor material. A big chunk of the emblem peeled right off by my just putting the the shirt on.<br /><br />This was fine for a one-time ST themed party. But don't look for any longevity out of the shirt by any means.
3.0,"So I got these pants for the sole purpose in wearing them around the house/running errands. I'm 5'7, 160lbs and got a medium and the fit is perfect. I also got the &#34;rose bouquet champagne blush&#34; and definitely NOT what the picture displayed it as. From my take I though the pants were purple with the rose splayed all over, but in fact it's more like a navy. (Meh). It's not terrible, but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />Also, the big question you may ask is are they see through or not? Well the lining in my pants were white & at first I didn't think so, but when I bent over they totally were!! I could see the butt designs on my underwear, so I guess if you're using these as workout gear I might look elsewhere. If you're wearing nude undies or maybe thongs or even going commando they may be fine to wear. I am in the end keeping these because you really can't see though them otherwise. They are very flattering & like many mentioned SUPER COMFY! They have a satiny feel & they don't give away every line or wrinkle in your legs. Also, the fabric is light, but not paper thin like I find in other brands.<br /><br />For the price, honestly it's about right. I live in activewear and was shocked at how much this cost (kinda cheap). Now does that explain why you can see some goods in a bent over position .. probably so. So that's why I gave it 3 stars."
3.0,Like the shirt little tight xxl
3.0,"Not sure about this coat yet.  It is tight in the shoulder, like all smart wool shirts on my body type. 127lbs 5'7&quot; 13% Body Fat.  I purchased the small, it fits perfectly everywhere except the arms and shoulders.  I am waiting for a medium and will update my review then.<br /><br />The main concern I have with this jacket is the zipper.  I hope the small I bought was defective and the medium I just ordered will not have the same issues.  Basically the zipper gets caught on itself about 7-10 times trying to zip up and down.  Its not because the zipper is taught, it just seems to not be zipping properly."
3.0,"Bought this as a gift for a coworker, it looks great. The only concerns I have are with the snitch, it was stained red and then the charms seem to fall off and won‚Äôt stay on tightly"
3.0,kinda chinsey
3.0,"I ordered a size 38, i had to pull it all the way to the last hole to get it tight enough to keep my pants up"
3.0,"All in all, I suppose you get what you pay for here. Just don't order it expecting too much. The look and feel of the item are illustrated here by its price. Fury suit items are pricey, especially the good ones. This was bought for a child to play with, so considering I suppose it's an Okay buy."
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed to find these were not really yellow lenses. In fact, they're pretty dark to look through. When on my (and my dog's) face, they look like a live filter app imposing them over a photo because of the mirrored lenses . I will say this though, they are very comfortable and stay on my face perfectly. I'm so torn!"
3.0,It is a nice charm to put on a necklace or bracelet but it is very pricey.
3.0,Liked the colors. Tail was shorter than I had expected (not long as was in the description).g
3.0,"Just trying on the jacket in the house, it is heavy enough but very light.  The coat is very nicely tailored however it was too small for me.  Leaving the jacket unzipped it felt fine.  I am 5""4 and 195 so I thought the XL would fit fine.  I am returning it."
3.0,XL will fit a 34DD bust. Not like the picture. Top is see-through. You will need to wear a vest underneath.
3.0,Too big for a medium. Size off a little.
3.0,"I purchased this for a costume, hoping that it would be nice enough to wear around the house afterward. It's definitely not, and for the price paid, I am disappointed in the quality of the fabric. That said, if you are just looking for a costume piece, this worked well. I was easily able to modify the fit with my sewing machine (to create sleeves) and a few safety pins (to gather fabric at the shoulders to create a more narrow fit).<br /><br />This is not a piece I would add to my everyday wardrobe."
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, but had to order a 3X to fit a L body."
3.0,"I really liked this jacket at first, it is warm and comfortable on cold runs in the NJ winter. However, after 2 washes it is starting to pill and one of the zipper ends fell off."
3.0,Looks nice but fits a little small
3.0,"The color and pattern is pretty. However, the seam under the breast is a bit rough: needs to wear a camisole. It's good for me as i am still breastfeeding and the access was good (so I didn't mind that it was a tad looser at the breast area as others have mentioned). This is not a summer dress--I was pretty hot and it's very hard to bend your knees and even hop onto a large, elevated car"
3.0,"It is very cute set, you get five ring, the color variation is very subtle. From close it looks like it has been made from low quality material. It have brassy ,metallic odor to it which is quite strong when you wear it. I used a layer of clear nail polish to mask the odor."
3.0,Wrinkles too much
3.0,"I like the quality of the tops but light colors are see through, and if you wear a bra under it, the thinness of the fabric with show the bra lines."
3.0,"They're nice but one came dirty, like food smeared on it:("
3.0,Nice wallet. Wish it was a smidge bigger but its useable for now.
3.0,cute at a button!
3.0,Very cute dress and really great price. Fast delivery. Too bad it runs extremely small!
3.0,"Extremely comfortable, but they definitely run big. I wear an 8.5w,so I thought after reading other reviews I would order an 8. Well, they were still to way to big."
3.0,"I usually wear a medium, but ordered this in large, which worked out fine.  I enjoyed the reactions I got from people about the shirt's design the one time I wore it, but it came out of my neighborhood wash-and-fold with weird oily-looking stains in all kinds of spots (sleeve, back, front) while nothing else in the laundry did.  I thought about having it dry-cleaned, but especially because I just had a hunch the same stains are going to come back, and the shirt's appeal to me was as cheap, impulsive fast fashion, I gave it to the Salvation Army instead.  Lots of loose threads, but trimmable if the shirt were more resilient."
3.0,"Overall it is a nice gown, but the straps were too loose and thin for me... and they weren't adjustable so I couldn't fix it.  I ended up cutting them off and going strapless.  The gown will make your boobs look great, but the inner lined cups like to fold over and peek above your cleavage.<br /><br />Also, there are two built-in slips.  The floor-length slip is fine, the slip under that falls just above the knee and is visible through the gown.  It just doesn't look good when you have a floor length dress and you can see a bold white hem of a slip through it.  I had to cut it out and hope for the best."
3.0,"This bathing suit runs very small. The material looks good quality, it is a really pretty suit, love that the straps can either be on or off. But I cant wear it because it runs very small.<br /><br />Amazon will donate to your favorite charity!

3.0,"The front strappy stuff isn't very good for small figure/chested women.  They seem to sit up high towards my neck, not very sexy."
3.0,No dur√≥ mucho
3.0,These socks are OK...no extraordinary material / quality
3.0,Liked everything for my granddaughter but the shoes way to narrow. She‚Äôs 5 and slim and couldn‚Äôt get her feet in them.
3.0,"This dupatta is gorgeous and the finishing is really nice. I was disappointed when I saw the color of this dupatta is exactly the opposite as advertised. The model is wearing a dupatta which is mostly yellow with a few patches of pink, but I received a dupatta which is mostly pink with few patches of yellow. Apart from that, this dupatta is gorgeous!"
3.0,Don‚Äôt like the fabric. Feels cheap.  Returned it
3.0,Fades quickly after first wash but for the price is good if just wearing for one occasion like we were- a princess birthday
3.0,Took 3 months to get! Which is why I gave it a 3 star plus runs a bit small so they are snug. But it‚Äôs high quality jeans!
3.0,The suit itself is very pretty just like it's pictured. Be aware that just because other consumers say it runs small doesn't mean all bodies are the same. I am 5'4 and 120lbs. I ordered a medium but should have gone with a normal small. The bottoms fit nicely however the top is awkward and doesn't flatter me at all. It is a bit too big in the chest therefore the top portion looks silly and doesn't look right. Go with your gut in sizing!
3.0,"It's nice material, fairly well made but would fit a child's head not an adult."
3.0,There is no information with the shirt to state that it is SPF treated.
3.0,"This sweater looks like a very cheaply made version of the picture. It is thin, as in summer sweater thin but with long sleeves, so not sure when could wear it. That is if it fit! This thing is a medium at best, not an extra large. And, I usually get things due to where they land on the waist in the pictures knowing if I get a few sizes up that it will be a bit longer. This is short compared to the images posted.  Due to being an Amazon Vine review item, I can't return this, but I will never end up wearing this. Really disappointed at the misrepresentation."
3.0,I like the blouse but it's too large on me.
3.0,These are HUGE!
3.0,It's cute the ring is adjustable but the chain is so long... it doesn't look right on. It kinda just flops all over the place.
3.0,My daughter loves this dress and I would love to give it a higher rating but it came with a small hole in the skirt that looks like it had been accidently sniped with scissors.  The material is also a bit thin.
3.0,they are cute and simole
3.0,Its not very soft and my butt still hurts while riding.
3.0,"Not completely opaque, nylon material. Good for the price, but I could probably pick up something like this for a dollar at the right store."
3.0,"Hilarious. Never in my life was a B cup too small. I'll trade it in for a C and my daughters and I can have a good laugh.<br /><br />Looks well made and minimally padded, which is my preference."
3.0,"warm sweatshirt, zipper is cheap and hard to zip"
3.0,This is a nice bag and made with good material just alot larger than I intended it to be.
3.0,I ordered my size but had to send it back because it was too small.
3.0,This is a little small and does not bend that easily.  Also a little difficult to put on by yourself.
3.0,"These fit well, but they are not as thick and opaque as I was hoping. Honestly, you're better off getting some basic thigh highs at the store-you will get the same quality."
3.0,They are quite comfortable but a bit see through.
3.0,The colour looks nothing like the picture
3.0,"Felt uncomfortable in my mouth, but that might just be me."
3.0,Just ok. It's not a loose garment as it appears. It's a skin tight polyester.  The sizing is even smaller than expected.
3.0,It‚Äôs nice but it‚Äôs been a month and it still smells like mothballs.
3.0,"Besides being pretty, I wish I would‚Äôve noticed the PROP 65 on the one I bought. I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it if I would‚Äôve noticed it."
3.0,"I normally wear a large EVERYTHING. I ordered large.....too tight, sent back and ordered XL......still on snug side. Lesson on this. ...order 2 sizes more than usual."
3.0,I wish the Gathering on the waist went down further. If you have a slight tummy bump it‚Äôs not very forging. Must wear tummy control under garments with this one.
3.0,"I bought the small and am 5'5"". The front is way too short. Only comes to a few inches below the crotch area."
3.0,Construction and material flimsy
3.0,These could be larger but they serve it‚Äôs purpose.
3.0,Very thin material.  The fit is fine but the quality is cheap.
3.0,pricey
3.0,Stylish but easy to bend.
3.0,"Nice, and fit perfect"
3.0,I did not receive my correct size order so the fit was a bit larger. I was disappointed but will try<br />to make it work.
3.0,"would be great but the sizing is off.  Usually wear American M, ordered XL, still pretty small.  Also, arrived with a hole in the seam.  Color is nice, lace fabric is nice.  I'm 135lbs, and curvy, XL too small.  Wish they came in bigger sizes because I would LOVE them if they fit ; ("
3.0,Sadly this thing started peeling off after a single wash.
3.0,"Fabric seemed a little stiff, but was nice and thick. Was not a fan of it for my body type. I am returning this dress. Maybe great for others."
3.0,Like it very much but not too happy about<br />the way it closes.
3.0,Small arms
3.0,Nice dress but cheap material.
3.0,"but maybe my head is the wrong shape or too small, because they tend to roll off my head after a few minutes. But it is good for hot yoga because it absorbs all of the sweat and doesn't tend to move to much after that. I do not recommend it for an active work out like kick boxing though."
3.0,The inc has disappeared the pictures made it look thicker but ok with ink failing looks low quality.
3.0,"The strap seemed very nice:  I liked the colors (black+blue) and the overall execution.  It looked good on my blue Mako II, but it was too large to fit my 6in wrist so I returned it.  (FWIW, the return process was easy.)  If there were a version that fit my wrist, I would have purchased it."
3.0,I actually really like this top but part of the seam ripped the first day of wearing it. :/ And it's not like it's super tight either. I know how to sew so I'll just be fixing it myself but I'm taking off two stars. Otherwise it's cute. Esp. with a belt as an earlier review noted.
3.0,They are a bit loose for my female foot.
3.0,Gift packaging crushed. Had to remove and rewrap them in my own materials to make them giftable. Nice bright color and soft material.
3.0,"This is a very thin material.  The purple is a vibrant color.  There are two hoods, and interior gray and exterior purple.  Both are attached and cannot be removed.  The gray hoodie has a string to tighten.  The hood is extra thick due to the double material.  There are even side pockets (although they are rather small).<br /><br />It‚Äôs a cute top with nice details (like those previously mentioned plus three buttons by the collar).  It is thin though.  It‚Äôs a cute shirt, but nothing special."
3.0,Pretty set. Clasp on chain does not open. Have to return the set or replace the clasp!
3.0,Broke after washing
3.0,"I purchased this to wear as a head scarf based on the description. First of all the material is way to slick to wear on your head. Second, the size is too small to be used as a head scarf. I am now giving these to friends that wear neck scarves as accessories. These will work well for that purpose, I think."
3.0,after a few uses the stretch goes away.  will not  recommend
3.0,I thought these masks were made in U. S. A. as that is what I searched for but find after purchase it said U.S.A. stock. They are really made in China and of an extremely flimsily cotton and although you can use a filter I would not wear on unless you do. You can see clear through the material without one even with the patterns on it. I will say the patterns are beautiful.
3.0,Costume glasses for sure!
3.0,Pretty dress but when they say bodycon they mean bodycon
3.0,"These are very cute and they do stay in, but does anyone really have nostrils this thick? They constantly touch the inside of my nose and irritate it. There's just no good reason for the stem to be so long."
3.0,"I did not look at the size, smaller then I expected"
3.0,for $22 dollars I expected a better quality made hat and one that is a bit larger.
3.0,"I bought this for my Granddaughter, she loved it."
3.0,Baggy fit. Perfect for skateboarding and mountain biking as I don‚Äôt like clingy stuff. Have bought 2 pairs. Wear out fairly quickly though if you wear them often.
3.0,I'm not sure what I expected for $40. The fit and feel like the price. I definitely won't be wearing these everyday for feel they'll just fall apart.
3.0,"Other than wearing this as an undergarment it really is not worthy, even with its low price, the material is very thing & you'll need a nursing bra underneath anyway. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone"
3.0,"I really didn't feel as though there was any compression with this shirt. I ordered a med because of all the warnings about them running small, but they are a bit to large. They will work for just a running shirt, but not a compression shirt."
3.0,Looks nice but the finish has not held up.
3.0,"These aren't custom gloves, but they looked nice enough for the one night I needed them. Pretty elegant, but if you need some to wear often I would suggest paying more for quality. They fit well."
3.0,Fabric is nice but only for size 6-8. Bigger than that. Nope.
3.0,It shrunk a little after washjng
3.0,"Turned silver after 3 wears which I did expect, but not that soon. I work in an office, so I'm not really sure how the gold rubbed off so quickly. Honestly, I still wear it. i just had to polish it to make it silver.<br />Not a bad ring, but I would say just be prepared for it to be a silver ring that you are buying if you purchase the gold over silver band."
3.0,Tight through the arms but otherwise okay
3.0,Opaque but thin material
3.0,"The color and material was of good quality. However, the large was very long by the croch area. I'm 5'9."
3.0,"The material and feel of the gloves is very nice, however, they seem to run small.  Mediums are usually a bit large for me but these gloves in a size medium are very tight."
3.0,I like the anklet however it broke the very first day and I have to have it repaired now.üòû
3.0,Little large for my face. Be sure to measure and compare to your face. Very dark. Has their logo large in gold on ear frames. Would be perfect if it were metal to Mold to face. I gave them away.
3.0,"Erm... so, I can't really tell if these are cute because they basically engulfed me. I usually wear a size 2 or 4 in Express pants and I read all the reviews about sizing up... I should not have done that. I got a size 10 and 12 (based on reviews and that these are coming from China). It could have fit two of me. They look cute in the picture and from what I can tell, they look like the picture in person, I just can't tell you about what they look like when they fit. I've reordered it in smaller sizes and will leave another review after I get them."
3.0,"I bought this hat as a gift for my brother-in-law, but had to return it as it was too large. I received the hat as a Christmas present and found it was also too large. Normally I wear a 7 1/4 fitted hat."
3.0,"Weighing in the 175-180 range, I followed the charted suggestion, and ordered an XL. I had read reviews about a struggle to get these tights on. My experience was the opposite. It too very little effort to get them up my legs, and the top fit more like standard leggings, with no noticeable compression or shaping in the upper legs or waist.  I have a couple great pair of 20-30mmHg socks, so I know what that compression level should feel like. These leggings did NOT provide that in the ankles/calves. If probably put these, at best, in the 10-15mmHg range in the calves, and much less everywhere else.<br /><br />I was also expecting leggings I could wear out. These are NOT OPAQUE. You can see the levels of graduated compression in the transparency of the different levels of the tights. I'm not all that modest, but I would not feel comfortable wearing these out without at least an upper leg covering.<br /><br />While quite comfortable, I found that I had to file my nails down, as the snagged quite easily on the fabric."
3.0,These shirts run super small group a size or maybe 2 if you dont want snug fit
3.0,"XL is more like a Large.<br />I'm  returning. I like the blouse, wish for XXL. I love Lace and I know how to handle it. You need to remove rings and bracelets, slide your hands in slowly, becareful, be delicate with the lace."
3.0,Looks good and i get a lot of compliments but all of sudden after a couple weeks i broke out in a rash from the latch part. Switched wrists and same thing. I am leaving it off for a week so it wrists heal and then I‚Äôll try it again
3.0,Dislike these shorts<br />They pretty see thru<br />Barely made out of anything
3.0,"It's a gift, but it is well made. I'm sure the person receiving it will love it."
3.0,"If you‚Äôre over the height of 5‚Äô6, don‚Äôt expect this to be a maxi, it‚Äôll be more of a ‚ÄúAnklies‚Äù, so it‚Äôll hit your ankles if you‚Äôre lucky. Overall I usually don‚Äôt have high expectations for fashion that I only spent less then $20 on, but there are pockets. So that‚Äôs a ‚ÄúWin‚Äù!"
3.0,Es un producto como para dormir
3.0,Half a size too small in my opinion. But otherwise good product.
3.0,"These boxer fit like they were made in the 80's, yes they are tight and short on the legs. I'm kind of a big and muscular, these boxer are for a skinny guy.They are not an everyday pair of boxers to wear, I use them sparingly, basically when there isn't any other boxer of comfort."
3.0,"I ordered the &#34;rose red&#34; which looks very much pink in the picture, which one would expect from the name of the color. It is most definitely fuschia though. And when I say fuschia, it is more of a purple shade than a pink. It is still pretty, but I'll have to continue my search for an actual pink dress.<br /><br />It is longer in the front than the back, which I did not expect. It would look better if it were the same length or longer in the back.<br /><br />The fabric is very soft and comfy. The pockets are in a good position so they don't ruin the look of the dress. Gotta love a dress with pockets! It looks very close to the model picture, despite my obvious mom belly, which I appreciate."
3.0,"Would not recommend for checked luggage.  Second trip came out with several dents on sides and piece of plastic around wheel came off.<br /><br />Otherwise, I liked the suitcase.  Holds a good week's worth of packing, but would recommend carry on only."
3.0,Way too small but good quality product. The case was great as well and the after sale service is commendable.
3.0,Runs small<br />Don‚Äôt fit. Will pass it on to someone
3.0,The picture is misleading and you need to order one size up.
3.0,BEAUTIFUL COLOR AND OVERALL LOOK BUT SIZE RAN SOMEWHAT SMALL
3.0,still have to order one size bigger from what it says
3.0,"Loved these glasses when I received them. I have only had them a short time, two weeks and last night the glass fell out. I am really disappointed."
3.0,Ordered a Medium<br />I'm 125lbs 5'2<br />The bottoms aren't as cheeky in person which is a downfall for me<br />the top is very cute and tight enough<br />The bottoms are tiny and a little too tight for a medium.<br />The top has lots of free stitches but I'm hoping it holds up for Florida!<br />Cute
3.0,Fits well comfortable in the top area.
3.0,I guess i have a large neck because they were way to small
3.0,I normally wear L or XL. I had to buy a XXL in this but it fits
3.0,I wear a large... well I thought if I ordered a<br />x large it was going to be perfect.. well it was too big.. i have to roll the sleeves up bc there‚Äôs so much extra material..I could‚Äôve got a large and it would fit perfect.
3.0,ES BUEN MATERIAL PERO ES REALMENTE PEQUE√ëA
3.0,Way too small. I had to order 3 sizes up
3.0,Meh....
3.0,"Majority of the chokers had the chain on the wrong side. The clip/hook is a little hard to open and it gets stuck. The chokers themselves are nice, it's just the chain and hook that need improvising."
3.0,The top was so cute and soft but unfortunately the inside itched like crazy! Wanted to keep these so bad.
3.0,"I had High hopes for this item since they were not cheap sunglasses, but I gotta say they are a little flimsy feeling like I could bend them very easily. Yes, they are light weight but not in a good way in my opinion."
3.0,It doesn't feel that great in quality. It broke after a couple of weeks.
3.0,"Cute, i bought this for my 9 year old neice... unfortunately the clasp broke instantly. Its fixable with some effort."
3.0,Looks just like the picture but I came ripped.
3.0,I simply didn't like it on me so I returned it
3.0,"lost a stone in one necklace the 3rd day i wore it, not happy with this"
3.0,I've ordered two of these bracelets for costuming purposes... there are definite differences between how the two fit and look... not that I expect a really great quality control for the price just figure that it's worth mentioning my experiences. So some might get a really good bracelet (like my first) and some of the reviewers might be getting one more like my second bracelet.
3.0,No consistent in head widths. But i like weight of it.
3.0,not what i expected it is pretty but not my favorite item that i bought. i will wear it with some of my outfits
3.0,Fabric wrinkles easily ... I should have checked before buying
3.0,"Cheap, broke easily. But will probably still buy again"
3.0,"I'm not sure how to rate it.  I ordered a size up because someone else said in their review that it ran really small.  So, I ordered a 18H instead of a 16H.  The pants fit him okay, but the jacket was WAY too big.  It would be a lot better if these were suit separates, so I could get a smaller size for just the jacket.  The suit is fully lined, and seems nice quality overall, but the fabric is an odd feeling plastic like polyester...but it could have been a lot worse."
3.0,"This is not worth $6, more like $1. Very disappointed!<br />This was just not what I was expecting  for the money!"
3.0,"These came shipped USPS in a padded envelope in their cloth bag. No box.<br />Fit is just OK.  Circumferential coverage is not great; lots of light leakage.<br />Tint is not dark.<br />Good $15 back up glasses for my Oakley M frames.<br />If I'm gonna wear and lose a pair of shades at the beach, these are your best choice."
3.0,The style of bag is great. I would buy it again but in a different colour. The wave dot is kindof ugly....
3.0,It's a foam mask that you put together on your own. It's rolled somewhat flat when you get it and you have to reshape and tape it together to make a cylinder. Looks more like a triangle. I put a soccer ball in to shape it and the tape came off. I ended up buying white duck tape from Walmart to reseal the mask. I wouldn't recommend buying unless you want to make it a DIY project. The lights are nice.
3.0,"I have cashmere sweaters, and this one doesn‚Äôt look and feel like cashmere.<br />Though model is really nice and looks stylish, but it‚Äôs not cashmere you expect to get."
3.0,It‚Äôs a waste of money I bought it thinking I‚Äôm going to be able to use it it cover my face but it‚Äôs so thin it‚Äôs like wearing nothing and on top of that it‚Äôs to small maybe for a child it be ok .i use it now but I use it and leave it on my neck while I exercise which is annoying also but I was hoping to use it kind of as a hanky
3.0,Looks great but have no wool inside like the one you find in stores
3.0,"Love the dress but I it does not fit like the pic and the sizing is completely wrong. But I figured if I put a belt around it, it should be fine, or lounge around the house in. Very soft material but disappointed that it does not fit as advertised"
3.0,the arms are very short.  weird material.  not what I expected..
3.0,love the color is they fit perfect
3.0,"roomy fit, flowy"
3.0,"I had cut other pieces from other necklace sets and put them back together as shown in the pictures and I love them. As for the earrings, I mean you win some you lose some. I definitely discarded most but there were a few gems."
3.0,My boys picked this out for a Mother's Day gift. The only issue I've had is that one of the charms has fallen off twice already. Luckily I found it both times and was able to put it back on. After the second time I closed the ring that holds it to the bracelet so that it overlaps a little so it shouldn't happen again.
3.0,"I didn't like the material, the fit was wrong"
3.0,They were beautiful but the parts that loop around your ears curve inward too much and put pressure on my head. I wish they went straight back instead of curving in.
3.0,With the added filter pad mask does not stay in place up on face. Material is good to keep cool son really likes just without the filter
3.0,Jacket is a soft material. Came in wrinkled and there is no stich lines as picture shows.
3.0,It didn't fit right and was too long.
3.0,"My daughter LOVES the Wizard of Oz and had outgrown her old ""Dorothy Shoes"" so we got her these as a replacement. After 2 wears to church the glitter is already worn off the toes."
3.0,They are bigger and more square then they looked on the people in the photos. But they work as protective eye wear for when I ride my scooter.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, however; it‚Äôs too short for a 5‚Äô9‚Äù girl. I purchased size L.  unfortunately, I have to return it. :("
3.0,"I agree with others who have posted about the length of the post.  Unless your nostrils are SUPER thick, the post is too long and so it fits very loosely.  I'm going to use pliers to try to fix it.  I do love how sparkly and large the crystal is, and it's clearly a well-made piece of jewelry.  The dimensions are just not right for me."
3.0,"This top is cute but it is the quality that you pay for, you‚Äôll see a lot of the seem and loose strings. The top is see through so you need to be prepared to sew additional fabric, get some sticker covers, or just wear it as it is. I ordered a size to small. I ordered a xsmall, and I found that my boobs were too big for the triangle portions of the top. If you‚Äôre a 32 B I would recommend going for the small or medium, not an extra small"
3.0,The belt I received was missing a set screw in the buckle and literally fell apart.  I returned the flawed belt to Amazon.  I did like the upscale packaging to include the cloth bag and nice box that the belt came in.  I purchased one of these belts about year or so ago and really like the way it looks and operates.  It adjusts quickly and in small increments ensuring a comfortable fit as your waste line changes throughout the day.  It is a good idea and I plan on buying another.  I would give it a five star rating if not for the flawed buckle.
3.0,Product is very very thin and the straps are extraordinarily large so we have to double up on the adjusters.
3.0,"I liked the size of frames, but from ear to ear it is too big for my head and i dont have a small head!  Cheaply made. Feels fragile and wobbly."
3.0,"Like the bead size, bought  another bracelet here and never take it off. This one does not stay tethered so the knot is constantly slipping and the bracelet falls off.  I do not have that problem with the Red Jasper one I purchased."
3.0,Got one wear out of it  because it kept itching into everything from my nail to my hand bag and so became fuzzy and looked worn.  Total waste of my money
3.0,"Super cute then I opened the package and realized it was cheaply made, i was disappointed since its the Disney costume.  I bought 3t-4t for my my 2 year old who wears a 2t and the costume fit nicely. After being in the costume for less than an hour it had a tear under the arm and a big snag in the front. Its cute but lacking in quality."
3.0,"I ordered a package to see how they fit. I received dark navy, gray and blue flowered. They fit as expected so I order two more packages. They all were the same colors as the first package. What women wants a drawer full of those colors?  Wish the description had said only one color set available."
3.0,"Liked best:  easy to put on.<br /><br />Liked least: seams and different textures. Prefer smooth, same texture."
3.0,Wayyy longer than what‚Äôs show in the picture had to return
3.0,It is very rounded and doesn‚Äôt fit well around the noes
3.0,Most of Copper Fit's products have been very good to excellent. The socks are not.
3.0,Cheap glasses. Break easy. The lens size is nice though.
3.0,"I loved my dress. I was the matron of honor and I wore this in a wedding. I normally wear a 12 but i ordered the 16 , wore a compression under wear and lost 6 lbs in order to fit comfortably in this dress. It looked beautiful on. The seams were not sewn together great and we undo before the wedding. I had to do some touchups. If you buy please make sure you get it professionally steamed."
3.0,Wheel Wax is great.  Save the $2 and get the version without the microfiber and foam applicators.  The included microfiber is absolute garbage.It's simply cut from a larger cloth with no stitched edges.  Lots of fraying right out of the box.
3.0,Hard to see display with old eyes and the band did pull on arm hairs as stated in another review.
3.0,"I thought I was ordering a black cord necklace and nothing in the description said this was on a navy blue cord...disappointed because I wanted black not navy, otherwise it's a nice piece."
3.0,I order five of this and they were okay but the faders were to lose...
3.0,The material was a little thin and did not compress enough. I returned them.
3.0,"The necklace is advertised as 124 cm long with 8 mm pearls.  I think they mean when the strands are untied and laid out straight, measuring from end to end, that it is nearly 124 cm long.  Mine arrived at 48 cm (19&#34;) long, while doubled and tied, so one could think of it as a 38&#34; necklace.  The loop for my head to pass through is 26.25&#34;.  Mine has 5 mm pearls in the body of the strands.  The three pearls on each strand end are 8 mm, 10 mm, and 14 mm.  Untied, mine measures 122.5 cm (48.25&#34;) long.  The photo shows this necklace hitting just around the top of the hip bone of the model.  I am 5' 9&#34; tall, and it hits me 6&#34; above my hip bone, and 3.5&#34; above my navel.  There are tiny white strings sticking out from each of the strand ends.  The rhinestone-set bead between the last two pearls on each strand is very nice.  The price is low, the pearls are shiny, and the delivery was fast.  I wanted this necklace for a 20's flapper look, for which it is too short.  If you just want something to go with a v-neck blouse, this could work."
3.0,Need a slip and I'm 5'4 and it's a little long. But it's pretty.
3.0,"The pin is beautiful, but not as pictured. I‚Äôve had a similar pin in the past and it looked like the pictured so I was hoping to replace. There should be Greek letters at the bottom but they are missing from this pin. Reasonably priced and otherwise beautiful but not quite what I thought it would be."
3.0,"Cute, the Red color is definitely pink and the material is a lot lighter and cheap feeling than I would have hoped. Length is long - knee length for me, I am 5'2&quot;. Sleeves are a bit shorter than the picture makes it look. Wouldn't buy again but it's not bad either."
3.0,"The waist in the photo on model looks lower than it was for me. It sat up higher than my natural waist. Also the material was a thick polyester, I didn‚Äôt care for the feel of it. Im returning it."
3.0,Could have have more ruffles
3.0,"I enjoy these sunglasses but for the price listed, others are offering 2 pairs."
3.0,"it was beautiful, it was just too small for what i needed"
3.0,Nice fit but soles are too thin<br />No support
3.0,took so long to get here but other than that very well made
3.0,"My daughter got so many compliments on these shoes. But, after about 6 months, both zipper pulls broke off and we had to use a paperclip to zip and unzip each shoe."
3.0,They didn‚Äôt work for me but aren‚Äôt bad.  Cheap quality but for limited use they‚Äôd be fine.
3.0,"Fit slightly awkward, when I smile they raise up off my face. Also one of the lenses doesn't seem to be seated properly in the frame."
3.0,They came back a little bigger than I expected. But overall nice jewlery for the price I paid.
3.0,the price is too much for this.  This one is not up to the original case for Ray ban.  Price is more.
3.0,It really wasn't what I was expecting.
3.0,I wanted to love this whole thing! We bought it for my 4 year old who is on the slim side. The shirt fits her pretty big (which is fine because it's pjs) but the pants are SO tight and DO NOT stretch. . It fits her for now but she definitely won't be able to wear the pants for long
3.0,Received a female suit instead of a male. I will exchange.
3.0,"Bought This For My Birthday Outfits , To Add Some Dramatic Flair To My Outfits & This Was Smaller/Shorter Than I Expected It To Be & It‚Äôs Not Fur All The Way Around . It‚Äôs Flat On One Side , Making It Not Look As Full As It Should . So I Sewed It Together , Like Hot Dog / Taco Style lol & Now It Looks  A Lot Better . More Fuller . Still On The Short Side , But I‚Äôm Still Going To Use It . Will Post A Pic Of My Final Product Later ."
3.0,It says this dress is ‚Äú3T-4T‚Äù it‚Äôs easily 2 sizes bigger. And the material is THIN. My daughter ended up with no costume because this dress ran WAY too big. Not worth the $20+ we spent. It‚Äôs cute and I‚Äôm sure she will wear it one days as a play costume. Overall though very disappointed in this dress.
3.0,Whoever designed the number layout must have been drinking.  The V for the five is upside down.  It should face the same way as the V for the six and seven.  The number for the six is reversed.  It reads IV instead of VI.
3.0,"These are very pretty if you only want it for jewelry. Makes a nice bracelet or necklace. However, I bought these hoping to use them for meditation and the beads are way too small for it to be comfortable while counting. Also, I chose the anchor but mine didn't come with one, solely beads."
3.0,"Nice set of chokers for the price, unfortunately they break easily."
3.0,It barely fits my wrist and my wrist size is an 8 1/2. It's a bit tight.
3.0,Stretchy material but pretty short and ran slightly smaller than expected.
3.0,"Super see through, had black panties on and can see straight through them. Absolutely not squat proof as cute as this set is. I wanted it for traveling but I felt that it was too transparent so I sent it back."
3.0,"I really hoped and Expected to get the outfit exactly as described because I LOVED the top but this is a dupe of an original outfit. I was able to find the real one with reverse image search... I‚Äôm disappointed because I expected it exactly as described, especially the top. But it‚Äôs super soft and I sized up as I‚Äôm a D cup and a medium fits perfectly, I may have even been able to make a Small fit too."
3.0,It looked nicer on line. But it's okay
3.0,"The dress is made out of very thin material, practical see-through. I like the dress silhouette with a pair of high heels and a leather jacket."
3.0,"The frames seemed refurbished. Had a new pair before and were polished all around... these looked used. The lens were new, of course!"
3.0,Poor make. One of the bags pockets was sewn incorrectly leaving a big hole in the bag.
3.0,"This is a cute dress, but it's really short. I'm 5'8 and 160 pounds, I bought a medium since that's what I usually wear, but the length of the dress is just too short for me. I think if I sized up, it would be too large on me, as the medium fit perfectly everywhere else. The dress is very flowy so a little breeze will easily show everyone what's underneath. The pockets are nice, but it adds a little more bulk to the hips. I've worn the dress twice, but made sure to wear tights or leggings with it to make sure my butt isn't hanging out. I wish it was a little longer as I do really love how comfortable the dress is."
3.0,"While you get a lot for the price, the elastic band does not stay on the finger lights, and you are constantly putting them back on for the kids, that is, if they don't get lost.  Guess you get what you pay for.  They are a lot pricier in the store for just a few, but the quality is definately better.  They are ok!"
3.0,I got extra large (I'm a size 14) but it is tight and binding. I love the idea though and will order it larger. I have so many sleeveless dresses I have been unable to wear and can now wear!
3.0,"Very cute, but needs to be dressed up with a belt or bow on the waist. Also the dress is somewhat see through in the chest area but can be fixed with a tank top."
3.0,Too small. Wore once and won't wear it again
3.0,"As a plus sized girl I buy a lot of batwing or dolman type blouses. This one is not my favorite. The fabric is uncomfortable, rough, doesn't breathe. And it really does fit like a tent, like you are trying to hide yourself, which never works in your favor. Also, the color is a lot more peach than I imagined which kind of makes me want to light it on fire. Usually I love what Allegra K offers but I would stick to the more supple jersey knits if comfort means anything to you."
3.0,It doesn‚Äôt really help unless you use hot hands with it. I bought this to get away from spending 10-15.00 a week on hand warmers. I used it at 30degrees for about 1 1/2 and my hand froze. Put the hand warmers in it and it was a little better
3.0,"Between myself and my daughters, we own about 6 of these hoodies. We‚Äôve loved them all! My most recent order, however, wasn‚Äôt what was expected. The red is super bright, not the shade depicted. It also seems of a lower quality than previous purchases. I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs just a fluke...it‚Äôs hard to find the perfect hoodie! If my daughter loves it we‚Äôll keep it, otherwise, it‚Äôs going back. Not gonna lie, I‚Äôm a little disappointed. If not for this most recent order, this would have been a 5 star review.<br /><br />As far as fit goes, these hoodies run small. My daughters usually wear size small in shirts/sweatshirts, but the size Large fits them great in these. Size up a size or two for a nice, comfy fit."
3.0,I could not wear them.  I have foot problems.
3.0,I would recommend these to anyone looking for super awesome tight stripper shorts for dudes.
3.0,Cheap but will be OK!!
3.0,These are cute but a bit see thru and run small and short
3.0,He did try little independent hard bathroom potty and he go sleep diaper
3.0,colors were not as bright as picture
3.0,The shirt is a little sloppy. I prefer a more form fitting but not tight shirt. This is good if you have a big belly.
3.0,"The product works well once attached.  The clip is somewhat difficult to use, especially one-handed and/or without looking, which is sometimes necessary while driving.  Also the case is virtually unusable for permanent storage ‚Äì too small and cramped, and doesn't fit the provided cleaning wipe.  Not a huge problem because my optician provides soft cases for free, but still..."
3.0,"Given as a gift, so I'm not sure of quality.  They seemed rather thin. Given to a lover of true crime, and she loved them! I would have bought more if they were thicker."
3.0,"Seem fairly substantial, but one has extra coating on it. Very unattractive. So I thought I was getting 7, but can really only use 6. It's the top right one (if you can't tell)."
3.0,"Purchased XL, too small but I liked the material and style. Good to layer in cold weather. Or freezing, like here in NH. So then I purchased an XXL. Fits just like the XXL. If you need one in XL or XXL, let me know."
3.0,I actually returned this when I realized how difficult it would be to store these without wrinkles all over the place.It's not as straight forward as a straight pair of pants since there is so much fabric. It was also not very soft linen and I knew it would end  up sitting in my closet all summer.
3.0,While this is a nice quality skirt my issue is with sizing compared to the same brand‚Äôs rash guards. This skirt in size 14 fits shortly on my 11 year old and the same brands rash guards in the same size is huge. It‚Äôs inconsistent especially if you want customers to order your swim recommended sets and not Mix and match with another brand.
3.0,the size was as expected and the design was cute but the material was super thin and wasnt super good quality.
3.0,"Beautiful dress but fitting not appropriate.. quite saggy from top. May be its not my correct size. I am 5'4 160 lb 10 or 12 size. Ordered large. May be medium would have been good. Very good quality material though. Flowy , soft, gorgeous."
3.0,These are SWEET until you put them on. As you pull them on your feet the color fades significantly
3.0,Nice top but not long enough to wear comfortably over leggings.
3.0,"The color is perfect, cannot see well with these glasses."
3.0,"Really, really small. I have a galaxy 7 with a slim case and that's the only thing besides some loose change that it can hold. It's also pretty poorly made. Lots of ragged edges and the strap could snap easily."
3.0,"The stripes are super great, accurate to images. However, after about 4-5 washes the shirt gets very pilly and static. Not anything special."
3.0,I absolutely loved the way it looked. Broke off after a few months of using it.
3.0,It's an okay phone case not the best but the price is pretty good. The phone holder doesn't clip all the way around the phone just the sides so not much protection of it falls opened.
3.0,The dress is stilted for a longer torso so we did have to go in and have the seams on the bust adjusted. It is a very thin material and needs a slip.
3.0,"This hat would be great IF it was available in sizes.  Because it is a only one size, it is too small for my head and causes too much pain, so I returned it."
3.0,Runs slightly smaller than other PB tops I've purchased.
3.0,Makes me sweat but the smell when I first received this product was so overwhelming. The smell lingered for quite a while.
3.0,Cute but broke in a week
3.0,The dress is short and looks like pajamas! The fabric is cheap and shiny. I would recommend this for a cute outfit around the house but not for going out.
3.0,One of the ratings broke after two days of wear - unable to securely close
3.0,Loves the look and style but I felt like it would have damaged my Apple Watch. I could not take that chance!
3.0,"This jacket seems ok, but there's just one thing that bugs me. The zipper is on the left hand side like on a woman's jacket. If I keep this jacket the zipper thing will bug the heck out of me."
3.0,It had a lot of loose and long strings that need to be trimmed on buttons and seams.  Order arrived more than 4 weeks after I ordered it.  Fits well but I won't order from this seller again.
3.0,My Son had a hole worn in these in no time from using his walker
3.0,Sizes run big & long
3.0,"The socks are comfortable, but advertising them as ""Navy"" when they are almost completely black is misleading.  I bought them because I needed navy socks, and I was very disappointed when they arrived."
3.0,Quality ok zipper will probably break soon. Recommend going up 1 size
3.0,"These do not have the brown tags shown in the photos. They were also significantly smaller than other similar styles. They are okay quality, but not what I was looking for."
3.0,This for a 2x fit more like a large...very tight in the hips
3.0,"I loved the pattern and wanted this to work but it was too baggy. The material was on the light side, great got hot days. Really wish it was a better fit for my petite frame."
3.0,The waist band of these pants is extremely tight even though they are my size. Once you get past the waistband the rest of the pants are fine but the waistband hurts my stomach because of its tightness
3.0,Don‚Äôt waste ur money for this
3.0,I bought it for the knot ring but ended up liking the arrow ring the most. I liked the idea of an adjustable ring but the knot ring and wave ring cut into the bottom of my fingers when I wear them. The arrow ring is great though.
3.0,"I liked these shoes, but gave this pair to a friend and ordered a pair 2 sizes larger!  Information provided said  the sizes listed are men's sizes.  Actually, they are women's sizes and on the small side at that."
3.0,Runs one size smaller no good I just returned the shirt
3.0,This is labeled youth but the sizes did not fit a 14 year old. They did fit my 7 year old perfectly. So be cautious with the sizes!
3.0,"Large face covering, a little too big for me. Very thick material. Good for germs I guess, but impossible for people to hear you talk."
3.0,tubes need to be an inch longer inside
3.0,"These were a part of Birthday Gift for Granddaughter. She was happy with the look out of the pkg. and the side pocket, although; they looked extremely small for her. She is too gracious to say that they didn't fit. I'm sure she'll give them away to someone she knows. Too small!"
3.0,Dress was gorgeous but fits small. I ordered the largest size and it was short in length. No bending over!
3.0,"Liked how breathable they are and ease-of-use and colors. Don‚Äôt like how the strings start coming apart after a handful of times of wearing. Also, I don‚Äôt know if this is due to shape or just being too big for my kid, but he has to wear the back clear up on the top of his crown in order to keep it from falling off of his little 5 year old face."
3.0,This would be perfect if it wasn't harem style. That is flared out widely in the lower part . Maybe some body types can wear this effectively? Not mine. I'm 5&#34;9 and carry weight in my belly. But this flares out really bad in the thigh area on me. Good lord. Maybe someone who carries a lot of fat in their thighs could pull this off?<br />It's so pretty otherwise. I may get it tailored to fit me better. Good luck.
3.0,not that great
3.0,"Beside the color, the belt doesn‚Äôt look like the one on the picture.  Slimmer and the buckle looks cheap. I guess for the price it is just right"
3.0,Look nice hard to close though
3.0,I wanted them to work.  Wouldn't purchase again
3.0,"These are striped socks in a variety of very, very colorful patterns.  They come up to about the ankle. They are billed as moisture-wicking and for sports. Nothing really wrong with them, except some of the colorways might be hard to match. The cool thing is you get 5 of them. if you like colorful socks, these may float your boat. For me, i would have preferred a few less ostentatious color variants. But, hey, you can never have too many socks."
3.0,Odd fit. Wide and short. Returned.
3.0,its very cheap looking
3.0,"Nice necklace, but it came apart the first time I wanted to wear it. My husband fixed it but I had already put something else on. Haven't worn it yet! Afraid it will fall apart."
3.0,These run massively small and after you wash them ... even smaller!
3.0,Not like the picture but still a pretty dress. The way the material flows in the picture is not like the dress I received. The dress is more like a t-shirt dress than anything. Still cute though
3.0,"This shirt is for juniors, not women. It runs small. It's a nice quality but it's really small. I gave it to my 10 year old niece. I purchased an extra large. I wear size 18 in womens so xl or 2xl normally fits."
3.0,Maybe I have a different definition of &quot;baby&quot;.  This hat may fit my daughter when she's 3 or 4. But it's a nice hat.
3.0,I was disappointed in these. I only needed a few pairs of the hoops But this big pack was all I could find. I just don‚Äôt trust putting them in my ears.
3.0,Too shiny and busy
3.0,It‚Äôs good quality and sturdy.  Yet it doesn‚Äôt stretch much. It‚Äôs a little to tied. It wins on the small side.
3.0,"It was a little tight which you can see in the photos but it felt fine, it wasn't squeezing my arm or anything. I had to take two of the clasps out to make it fit because it was way too loose with just the one clasp removed. It was very pretty and very comfortable, easy to use but it made my arm green after only about 12 hrs of wearing it. Due to this fact, I am returning it.<br /><br />It would be absolutely perfect if it were real silver. I would definitely purchase if they would make a real sterling silver band because the style is beautiful!  Please make a real one!"
3.0,Was okay once I figured them out.
3.0,IT just did not fit my body right.  I am 5'9 150 lbs and got a large. The leg part was loose and where you tie around the waist it hit me higher so my gut showed.  The fabric is really soft.  Wish it fit me better
3.0,"I like to sleep in loose fitting PJs or nightgowns, and in that respect this soft cotton-jersey nightshirt is comfortable. However, the one-size-fits-all isn't to my liking, it is so enormous that it's like wearing a tent. I'm an average sized woman, 5'4"" and 142 lbs. Not slim or petite, just average; and even though I've washed this sleepshirt twice in hot water and dried on full heat, I could still fit 3 of me into it. I like the soft feeling of the fabric, but it's so huge that it bunches up & gets twisted around during the night. If they made S-M-L sizes, I would have bought another one. Its comfortable cut and fabric might make it a good choice for a larger woman."
3.0,Cheap price cheap quality
3.0,"The purple hat is nice.  Wish I can have the purple rose like the picture shows, instead I have the dark red one, not happy."
3.0,"I know the colors on the screen may vary a bit, but the shirt I received was definitely an orange shade and not red as pictured. Therefore, shirt was returned. On a positive note, the fabric feels soft and comfortable to touch."
3.0,"They look great, but the gem fell off within a month."
3.0,Had to return they were too tight
3.0,These masks are okay. We have enough so that our kids wear a different mask every day to school with all of the masks going in with the Saturday wash. Our masks are washed in a lingerie bag and hung up to dry in order to keep them looking/working like they should. The very first wash these came out all pilly and faded. Probably doesn't effect the function at all but they definitely weren't as cute the second wearing as they were the first and not sure how long they are going to last overall but kids say they are comfortable.
3.0,I got these cause I‚Äôm a loader in a freezer. There warm but very hard to write with.
3.0,Love the fabric and design except the back of the garment feels small while the front feels extra large.  Seem to have to adjust to the way it feels each time I wear it.  It's almost as if the back from one size pattern and the front is from another size.
3.0,Fell apart after using the first time.
3.0,The bottom part of the shirt is a bit baggy for what I like. The top fit great.
3.0,"Very lightweight and comfortable for wear over a bathing suit.  However, it is sized a bit small, especially in the shoulder area.  If you have broad shoulders, you may need to look for another product."
3.0,The product was as expected. The shipping cost was too much for this product.
3.0,Little frayed on ends but overall very cute
3.0,"I really like the dress but it is about 3 inches too long. I am 5'3&#34; and even with really tall heels, it touches the floor. The pockets almost make up for it being too long."
3.0,The controls are built into one of the ear phones.  This makes it more bulky that the other side.  Still not as bad as trying to lay my head on the pillow with normal headphones.  But why?  They sound okay.  definitely not tinny like the cheap ones.  Not mega base either.
3.0,"The pattern is cute and the material is soft and lightweight. Nice for a casual wedding. However, there are no belt loops so the belt kinda slides down and you have to keep retying to make sure it doesn‚Äôt fall off."
3.0,Cute. Not the best quality but what can you expect in this price. Nice.
3.0,"This top is really cute, but veryyyyy cropped. Almost too cropped for my liking"
3.0,You will like the compression but they run much tighter and smaller than expected
3.0,It was much wider than I had expected from the photos.
3.0,It was much smaller than expected and I was not at all happy with the purchase.
3.0,"Nice looking, flexible watch band. The picture is a very accurate representation of the color. I have a big wrist and the watch fits with 2 holes to spare. My one complaint is that it feels and acts much more like a rubber material than &#34;genuine&#34; leather as the description states."
3.0,Love the size of these earrings. They have no backs so I lost one the first day I wore them.
3.0,"A good looking navel ring. a tad bit bigger than i expected, but looks good"
3.0,"This felt more like a graduation gown with a hood than a cloak. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and weigh 220lbs and I bought the XL and it was really, really long but the width was a little too snug, kinda disappointed but I‚Äôll make do."
3.0,"These shoes were comfortable if you are used to wearing a heal. I am not so I did return them, but they are very comfortable except that they make you walk more on the ball of your foot and I am not used to that. I was sad to have to return them."
3.0,"I play roller derby and sprained my ankle badly about 3 months ago.  In order to get back on my skates my doc suggested an ankle brace for added stability.  I've skated with this one about 5ish times so far.  It holds up well, as roller derby isn't easy on anything, but I'm finding that it is just too bulky.  I was hoping for something thinner.  This makes my skate boot stretch like crazy, which isn't what I want to have happen on $600 skates. It also aggravates my skin at some of the velcro points which wasn't pleasant.  So, yes, it did its job in that it kept my ankle stable, but if you're looking for something sleek that won't get in the way or be too bulky, this isn't it in my opinion."
3.0,"Good cleaning kit, but the bottle expands and deforms if left in car in extremely hot weather (100F+). May not be an issue if you don't have dark interior and/or high temps"
3.0,"they are really cute, feel nice and light, but a jewel isn't on the leaf. Plus, after wearing it for only an hour or two, my finger started to turn blue!"
3.0,"Nice robe however the second time we are using it, the stitching in the hood is coming apart. I can restitch but I shouldn‚Äôt have to."
3.0,Material OK but fit a bit large
3.0,Definitely size up at least 1 size.
3.0,It was heavy and stretched
3.0,The product is the right one but you set higher expectations when you show the small black bag
3.0,"I should have paid closer attention to the product photos. The model is shown wearing a knit, loose fitting sweater. The photos with just the top show more of a sweatshirt look. I received the sweatshirt, not the model's knit sweater. It seems warm, which is nice, but I should have ordered a size or two up to make this top a bit roomier. The product photos are very clearly two different tops. I'm not sure if they both exist, but I would have preferred the knit sweater. I might just exchange for a larger size."
3.0,I was disappointed because the colors were not the same as the picture on Amazon. The product looks faded . I do not recommend this product.
3.0,Good mask a bit big on my face.
3.0,"I really like the way these cufflinks look. I wish the parts moved a little better, but they still look great.<br /><br />I gave three stars because one of mine came with a minor scratch on the face of it, and the posts are just kinda clunky and too long for my liking. They would probably work best with thick jacket/shirt. I wore them with a regular button down long sleeve and they kind of just droop due to the length of the posts. So all I can gather is that I need a thicker shirt or thicker wrists."
3.0,Quality was great just didn't fit my husband.
3.0,It was significantly smaller than it said it would be. i took out the cups and its still tight.<br />I'm a 32 B and got small (which probably wasnt a good choice in the first place but still)
3.0,"My wife did not like this as far as the fit goes. Overall they‚Äôre soft and comfortable, but the waist area is too low so they constantly fall off and she has to push them up. Leggings are so hard to buy online. They look great just not super practical for workouts since you constantly have to remember to pull them up."
3.0,It's alright but I had the wrong size!
3.0,The size is good but I expect better quality
3.0,"Fairly decent other than the proportions are off a bit. After several washes, the black vest still reeks of dye or something."
3.0,The quality was there...but I am size 16 and ordered an XL and it was approx. 3 or so inches to small to even zip. Returned with full refund.
3.0,Good fit but gold wore off quickly
3.0,Super thin and completely sheer. It also has a seam up the back that isn't cute and could have been on the sides instead. But it fits decent enough.
3.0,"Very cute, but run VERY small."
3.0,This shirt is very cute just fits a lot smaller then expected
3.0,"Got them ,tried them on they were way to small for my calves super cute tho."
3.0,Sweet gift but the bracelet begin to turn yellow after awhile.  Not for everyday wear.
3.0,Definitely cheaply made.  You can get a couple wears out of it before it looks tarnished.
3.0,Not big at all.... should say medium!!! If you are looking for big hoop earrings...bypass these
3.0,The largest bags zipper broke the first day on my 2 week trip and would only zip 75% of the way closed.  I didn't even stuff it to the max. They other bags were ok.
3.0,To small sleeves to short
3.0,Cute as pictured but zippers and snaps are not good at all. My rating is for the looks and space but I would not by again because of poor zippers and snaps but I guess we get what we pay for.
3.0,"So these definitely run large - my daughter is now in 18 month clothes and they are just starting to fit.  The band across the top sort of keeps them on, however somehow she manages to pull the toe part of the sock off leaving the rubber band and still wrapped around her ankle and then gets really upset that they dont come off the rest of the way.  They are also a bit thick, so now that she is in shoes they dont fit terribly well because the extra fabric bunches up.<br />The anti-slip pads have stayed in place for many washing though, which is more than I can say for some of the other brands out there.  Overall they are holding up well."
3.0,"Too large, did not like the new smell, but better now."
3.0,"true to fit, not as much support as their older models"
3.0,Ehhhh....These were not as big as I thought they were going to be.  I did not care for them too much.
3.0,Super cute but after 3 washes the stitching around the legs are already starting to come undone.
3.0,This is nothing to get excited about. I guess it will serve it's purpose
3.0,"The image is clear from far, but as you see it close up, the image has noise.  The image is not clear and is pixelated."
3.0,Cheap looking but did what we needed it to
3.0,Lower plastic gram broke after a few months
3.0,Bought it larger than I am but didn't take on the asian sizing into account. looked beautiful but had to return.
3.0,They help a little bit - no complaints though as they are not real expensive. Everyone has different results so they are worth a try.
3.0,It might be okay. I accidentally broke mine. Never new you could break a belt buckle. Three stars because I might have been my own fault.
3.0,The fabric feels more like paper than fabric.
3.0,"These leggings are ok.  They look stylish but they are definitely not for working out.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the smell.  There's a weird gas-like odor coming from the pants.  I guess it'll go away with a few washes.  I have a thing about bad odors so right away that was a turn off for me.  Next I noticed how thin they are.  While they're cute leggings there is no way I would wear them as pants to work out in, unless i have a shirt to cover my bottom.  I have big hips and a big bottom, you would definitely be able to see my underwear through these.  They are kind of long.  As you can see in my pic, the top goes well over my belly button and I can put them all the way up just under my bra line, that's without stretching them.  They're cute, they have a cute design on them, but I would only wear them with a long top.  The only upside is my hubby really likes the way they look on me and mentioned it quite a few times when I wore them."
3.0,"Returned it - for reference I'm 5'8 and 34A. This top hung on me shapelessly and made me look flatter than I even am. Think you need some curves to wear this top well.  Material is nicely thick and soft, though."
3.0,There is no a quick guide inside the box and is not so easy to replace the lenses...
3.0,"The only thing I don‚Äôt like about these shorts, is it ‚Äúhides‚Äù your butt, unlike my other gym shorts."
3.0,"I'm 5'8, 140lbs got a medium and felt like I was being strangled until I wore it for hours."
3.0,I live the feel and color.  Band after a few uses stretched out.
3.0,the material is very odd and slightly uncomfortable
3.0,"It's a little on the poor quality side, but it works for what I wanted it too. The only down side is it didn't really glow as expected. I tried up to 1000 lumes to try and get it to glow. You could barely see it glowing."
3.0,"Blue mask was used for a Halloween party, worked no problem...<br />Red mask stayed on when the batteries were installed. There it away,<br />They both made a high pitch noise when on...<br />Cheap enough for a party mask..."
3.0,This is a cute swim suit and an alternative to wearing a tankini if you're shy about your midsection after a baby.  It fit a little tight I got an xl and am a size 14/16.  But overall it's cute and seems to be good quality.
3.0,It's bigger than I expected for a 12 month old girl but it'll do for a 1 day thing.
3.0,"They came in very quickly, but didn‚Äôt look quite like the picture. The earrings are pretty, but there‚Äôs barely any orange in them."
3.0,Very cute! Just super disappointed it was too small.
3.0,Sleeves were too small.
3.0,surprised that it was a back out but like the fit
3.0,Wish it were a bit longer. No more then an inch. It'd be nice not to have to fold the money in thirds. I prefer in half  just for convince but it won't fit. Pain when you have more then a few bills and trying to fold them all.
3.0,"These are cute slippers and look comfortable but they run VERY small. My daughter wears a size 1-1/2 and I ordered size Medium, which says it is for sizes 2-3.  They were way too small."
3.0,I guess they r ok. They kinda look cheap. Gave them to my daughter she loves them.
3.0,too short and scratchy
3.0,Cute print. Too big for a child and too small for adults.
3.0,THE CLASP WIL BECOME LOOSE AFTER A WHILE HAD FOR ONE WEEK AND WORKED WELL BUT THE CLASP WILL BECOME LOOSE IF THEY FIX THIS THE PRODUCT WOULD BE AWESOME.. LOKS GREAT THOUGH
3.0,Runs large. Must be unisex sizes. I really wanted to love it but it fits weird. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll relax after a few more washes (it‚Äôs already been washed once) but right now it has a weird fabric gap at the back of the neck that I just can‚Äôt get over. The picture doesn‚Äôt even do justice to how funny it looks. I‚Äôll have to always wear my hair down with it. The fabric is soft though and the graphic held up through its first wash fine.
3.0,Love this dress but did not like the material.  Unfortunately had to return
3.0,It's a really cute bathing suit but just don't think it flatters my very large chest (36 G) well.
3.0,Exactly as pictured but definitely size up!
3.0,"I ordered this bag for my husband to use for short trips, 2 or 3 days.  For that purpose,It's OK, but it arrived without the Removable Hanging Hook.  When I attempted to contact the seller via Amazon, I was directed to contact Amazon.  The only online option was to return the bag in its entirety.<br /><br />I called Amazon and was advised that they could not contact the seller and I could return the bag or accept a 20% discount.  I didn't care for either option.  What's so difficult about Amazon contacting the seller and getting this missing part.  At any rate, I accepted the 20% and will attempt to find the hook elsewhre."
3.0,Love the print.  It needs to come in a tall size.
3.0,Just what it says above. The brim is a little on the small size also. I originally bought it for my daughter who has lupus. I was too small both in hat size and brim size. The next brim size up was hollywood big....just too big!
3.0,Pretty flimsy material.
3.0,Dress was beautiful I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 150 lbs it fit nice and tight in all the right spots however the front piece is Very short if you‚Äôre conscious of it it‚Äôs fine. The shorter lining goes all the way around to the back so dancing it would come up but the longer piece is over top so you can‚Äôt see anything it‚Äôs just a little uncomfortable because it rides up if you plan on dancing! Maybe having a medium would have helped!
3.0,Flowers fall of easy
3.0,"For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 142 lbs, size 8 in pants and usually small or medium shirts.<br />Based on reviews from others my weight I ordered a medium. I‚Äôm glad I did because it‚Äôs perfect without being too loose or too tight. The issue I have with these shirts is the bottom of the shirt sort of flares out and is odd. It‚Äôs okay for working out around the house but it‚Äôs not my favorite shirt by any means. I ordered the 3 pack of black tanks and they all seem to fit the same. I wouldn‚Äôt order these again because the fit is kinda odd."
3.0,"These aren‚Äôt really compression shirts. They‚Äôre more like breathable tank tops or undershirts. They‚Äôre good for the gym or day to day usage, but if you‚Äôre looking for real compression, I don‚Äôt recommend these."
3.0,"Thos top was too cropped for me. It looked longer in the advertisement. It's about as big as a bra rather than a shirt. The material is soft and comfortable but I can't wear this outside the house. All in all, I can't reccomend it if your wanting a traditional crop length top."
3.0,"good quality,some of the products ordered returned because of some gold plating and size minor issues"
3.0,"Sizes seem to run small. I ordered an XL based off of my measurements on the size chart and I couldn't even zip the dress up. The dressed didn't seem to have any &#34;give&#34; (I'm a curvy girl), so unless you luck up and get a perfect size it may not fit right. The person has to fit the dress...the dress will probably not fit you."
3.0,"I ordered this dress as my regular size, large.  The size is perfect - fits as expected.  I did modify the neck line about 2 1/2 inches as I like more of a V neck for my body type.  I received many compliments on the dress but it was very hot!  The fabric is not breathable at all - specifically the lining of the dress.  I wore it to see a band and I didn't even want to dance because I was burning up.  I was glad to get back home and take the dress off & cool down."
3.0,I didn‚Äôt realize each color was a separate piece of fabric and so they gap between. But my daughter wore it for her rainbow themed 5th birthday party with leggings underneath and she enjoyed it! It wasn‚Äôt too expensive and served its purpose and now it‚Äôs going into the ‚ÄúDress Up Bin‚Äù with all the other costumes.
3.0,The glasses weren't too bad but the foam was deformed.
3.0,Bottom seems started coming apart after the first couple of washes.
3.0,Sizing is smaller than expected
3.0,"It was ok. Very thin and almost see through. Buttons on the front put on loose and hung down, so that didn't look good. I'm sort of heavy so i don't think it was at all that flattering on my plus size."
3.0,Not as long as I'd like
3.0,They're really pretty but unfortunately mine were too small. Not all of the wooden ones seem to be the same size either. The metal ones wouldn't even stay in my ears. I'd size up and try again if they were a little cheaper.
3.0,"Twist on plastic, the fit well just not as weighted as I thought it would be"
3.0,"The quality was great but these were way too short for men's pants I bought them for my husband who's 6'2"" and I am 5'7"" and they were too short even for me!1"
3.0,I got a medium due to it being the smallest size offered. It's too big for me. It's made nicely and in good condition. Just not the right size for me.
3.0,Ordered up a size. I like it and wear it not crazy about it.
3.0,"Came in good condition, fit fine. Not the greatest material though."
3.0,Its ok for the price but not the most comfortable glasses.
3.0,This item was extremely disappointing.  Did not look like picture at all.  Disappointed and returned.
3.0,Belt is a very nice belt. It arrived on time.I would have given 5 stars but one of the snap enclosures on the belt would not stay closed. Did not have time to return it for another one. But otherwise it would have been perfect.
3.0,"Nice glasses. but lot of  letters itched on the glass.  I paid little more than  from other sellers because it was &#34;Prime&#34;, it arrived one day later than promised and  the  original box  didnot look legit.  Thinking about returning  back."
3.0,"This was pretty as imaged. The costume was too small for my daughter who is tall, the item was too short."
3.0,color is neon pink
3.0,Very thin material.  Would not recommend.
3.0,Its nothing exceptionally great but it's doing the job it was designed to do. Cost to much to look so cheap. It's is not a woven band like suggested.
3.0,Bought this for our 11yo. He loves the colors. Not sure how long he will be able to wear them because they are short on him and he is small for his age.
3.0,Its small
3.0,"Cord is crappy plastic that will never straighten out so I'll be replacing it with a leather cord, but the pendant is nice."
3.0,"had them in my pocket for about 30 mins and they snapped. i can probably fix it, but i shouldnt have to after one use."
3.0,Chain broke first time putting it on
3.0,"This dress is adorable and I wish I could keep it but it‚Äôs just way smaller than I thought, too tight in the chest area. Sending it back. Recommend getting a size up"
3.0,Look nice but I have to return it for an allergic reaction with material.
3.0,Sandle could be comfortable but straps are too loose on my foot. They don't hold the sandler onfor walking.
3.0,"I got these for my husband. They're different. Not for everyday use, but he liked the idea of keeping them in places for emergency or momentary use. He likes how compact they are and the cases they come in. The telescoping temples work better than I imagined, probably because the fit is snug. The lenses are very small. My husband did say the nose hurts a bit. Everything came in a box. A cleaning cloth was included. For the novelty, I guess they're priced okay at $17.99 plus an extra 5% off."
3.0,"This bathing suit is well made, however, the sizing runs small. I ordered a medium because it says true to size and that's what all my other suits are. I am returning the medium and getting a large because it is a nice swimsuit and I love the support it seems to have up top, unlike others in this price range."
3.0,"The bust of the size dress I chose was too large, however waist down was -perfect. I wear a 38B bra so I had to add a dart to the breast of the dress to get a perfect fit. As for the color and design of the dress you could not ask for anything better."
3.0,"Really cute as a short, but only an inch or so past the croche area."
3.0,Nice quality but no where near the right size. Need to order up 2 more sizes
3.0,I ordered 00's.  They seem smaller than that and don't fit my ears well.  Can't use them
3.0,Actually kind of small and uncomfortable after a while. I wish socks and such came in sizes - better array of sizes.
3.0,"These slides are ok, I wanted to love them more. but they are slippery with or without socks. Also, they don't look very masculine. I expect less drag queen and more regular slides but at least they are my size."
3.0,"These are great shoes except that I ordered a half size up and my toes still hit the end of the shoe. The heel is very comfy, but I felt like my foot was tilted too much and it too much pressure on the ball of my foot. I don't think I will order a bigger size. The strap across the top of the foot is quite short. My feet are not fat, and it wasn't a lot of strap."
3.0,"I'm not a big guy through the waist but i found this shirt tighter than expected. good image on the front, though."
3.0,size 4x is more like a size 16
3.0,I don‚Äôt like color. It is not sheer . My legs look awful in them.
3.0,"This is a really pretty beaded bracelet. I love the story behind those making these bracelets, as well.<br /><br />While this bracelet is pretty, and well made, I do think the beaded area should be more, as it only covers the top of my wrist. I have a pretty averaged sized wrist (6.75 inches), so for a larger person, this isn't going to work well. I've provided pictures to show this."
3.0,"The backside (inside) of this bag seems to be genuine leather, but the outside is not leather. They must have bonded a man made leather like material to the rough leather. I was disappointed to have paid the money for real leather when I found that it in all actuality isn't completely genuine. I guess they get away with it because the backside is genuine. Other than that, I love the size, color and shape. It holds everything I need it to and then some. Love the bag, just sad that the outside part isn't leather."
3.0,"it was beautifully crafted, fit to a T, fabric is just too stiff and scratchy.  I am extra skin sensitive."
3.0,I bought a medium in this shirt. Expected it to be a little bit more fitted. The material seems cheap and the neck line needs double sided tape to keep it in place.
3.0,"The label in this shirt says 95% polyester, 5%spandex.<br />No silk content as advertised."
3.0,"First I'd like to say that this dress came in extremely wrinkled. I mean, like it had been wadded up in a ball before being placed in the bag. But, the material was very nice. It was soft, thick but breathable. The colors were very vibrant and what I had imagined based on the image. The front hem was just below my knee and it dropped a lower in the back. The neck fit well and was not too tight. I did return the dress because the style wasn't what I was looking for. This dress could definitely be used for a business casual work setting or for lunch with friends. Very easy to style dress."
3.0,"These actually fit snug.  They are cute shorts if you  have a small waist.  The elastic in the waistband is not sewn in, so it twits and turns and you have to stretch the shorts out constantly so the band is consistent."
3.0,3xt is more like 2xt
3.0,The shorts are just a little small for me if i could get just one size larger I think I would be ok but I don't think they come any bigger than the ones I got if they did I would buy them because other wise they are pretty good.
3.0,Super tight and too small
3.0,"It was a LOT shorter than the picture makes it seem. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and it went about an inch past my knee. Not only that, but it didn‚Äôt have any pockets, though the description says it has pockets. It‚Äôs not too bad of a skirt, but it‚Äôs hardly close to what the picture shows. Also, upon receiving it, the skirt was increasingly wrinkled."
3.0,I received only two masks instead of three false advertising!
3.0,"Makes your skin green, very fragile and not durable. Could break easily"
3.0,"I loved these earrings and wore them frequently when I received them. After a couple weeks of wear, each of the earrings came undone. The threads came unwound essentially leaving the earrings shapeless and useless. I tried to fix them myself but sadly was not able to. I guess for the price, I got a good bit of wear out of them."
3.0,It look nice but it not lying Dow like the picturesque
3.0,"I received my package today/this evening. I immediately tried the pants on. I really enjoy and like the way the pants fit. However, I discovered a small hole in the pants the size of a half cm. Other than that,  not bad for the price. I would like to receive another pair without a hole if they‚Äôre brand new."
3.0,"But fit extremely small , I ordered 2x up and they still fit me kinda tight .. so tight that if I sit for about 30 minutes or longer my stomach will hurt, but overall the jeans are as described and look cute. Just wished they fit. I'm 155 lbs 28&#34; waist , 40&#34; hips and I ordered a 2XL and still fit tight, so &#34;thick&#34; ladies beware"
3.0,"I ordered two of these, 1 of which I intended to return but ended up keeping.The customer service was very prompt and friendly. I had never worn my beads on a bracelet and once I did, I never took it off. That said, after a month + of nonstop wear, the braid unraveled/broke apart and I almost lost all my beads. I purchased them because of how inexpensive they were, but I don't think they are intended for constant wear. For the money, not a bad deal!"
3.0,Bought to wear as part of a costume so they worked out fine.  Material is pretty thin so I wouldn't be wearing them otherwise.
3.0,These are very narrow as well as small in general -- they kinda pinch the sides of my face. They're also so short that it's hard to get them to cover my eyes completely. Otherwise they're okay.
3.0,"For the price this was a pretty good deal. However, I had to take the padding out because they were Styrofoam and made a lot of noise while wearing it."
3.0,Poor quality but looks good
3.0,"The dress looks exactly like the pictures so that's a positive. It is decent quality for an amazon dress. However, it is very long, not at all as short as it appers on the model. Of course, I'm only 4'11 so many things are long on me and I'm used to that and I make do with the length.  This was too long to make do, though. It was also way larger than I thought. Wanted to like it, but it was overall too large. Will be returning. UPDATE: Well, when I initially reviewed this dress I still had every intention of buying products from this seller. But after I posted this review the seller contacted me asking me to &#34;take down my negative comments.&#34; This was not only ridiculously, unsolicited, and unappreciated, but unprofessional. My comment of the sizing being too large is the truth-so be warned when you buy! I definitely will not be ordering from them again. It's up to consumers to notify others about things of this nature so they do not fall into similar situations."
3.0,I bought 3 pieces of these and one of them has damage. Am i entitled for a refund?
3.0,Like the top. Bottoms not so much.... too cheeky for me. Not appropriate for a family vacation ü§£üòÇ
3.0,I wear size large in every pair of leggings I own. These are stretchy but still run small. I would size up next time
3.0,"They are easily scratched and I cannot find a way to get it out. The tab that keeps it on your nose won't go back to normal and leave a big mark. However, they're cute and 'work' just fine"
3.0,Too thick for what I wanted.  Really for toe dancer shoes.  I just needed something to keep my shoe from slipping off.
3.0,Barely any support.
3.0,It definitely tarnishes. With normal wear and some sweat it produces a strong metal scent. I changed the chain and just wear the kettle bell now
3.0,I loved the light material and the blue color but I returned this item.I got it to wear with jeans and its more for leggings. Im short and my hips are larger so it didn't look good. If you are in between sizes go a size up.
3.0,Ordered 2 sizes larger and fits snug. Ordered a Faith inscribed and got Jesus. Shorter than I expected. Will most likely give it to a family member.
3.0,"Overall value for money is pretty darn good I have to say. Is it waterproof? Really really waterproof? not really. I‚Äôve never dropped it in water but I have had it in wet conditions and some moisture got inside. However, for what I paid it performed pretty darn good. Another issue is the plastic that covers the camera made photos look like they were taken through someone‚Äôs very dirty windshield. If you only want water resistance, just peel that bit off. Finally I‚Äôll say that the vibrate/sound slider doesn‚Äôt really work. It‚Äôs too stiff to move. I love the slim form factor and I love the price, and it IS water resistant. Happy overall."
3.0,"Nice pants, runs a tad big. Only downside is the elastic waistband twists when washed"
3.0,The shirt fits good. However the design is crooked on the shirt.
3.0,not as good as the actual Seiko band
3.0,"Belt works, but is too expensive for what it is at nearly $16."
3.0,"It's a nice bracelet, but buy it because you want a blue accent along with another silver bangle or two."
3.0,"It's a great dress, but it's too big : ("
3.0,"It‚Äôs ok just put it on today and it‚Äôs already frayed, I like the design just wish it was a bit more sturdy"
3.0,These are surprisingly small and you‚Äôll really need a magnifying glass to read the text. Other than that they look like they‚Äôre supposed to.
3.0,This dress runs large but overall pretty comfortable. I didn‚Äôt buy it for this reason but this dress makes a surprisingly good nursing dress.
3.0,The CERT was OK but the pants were way too long
3.0,"Ordered the purple one, and what I got is completely different from the picture. Instead of the butterfly sleeves, it has lacy, poofy sleeves. It's cute enough I'll give it a try, but it's not what is pictured."
3.0,"Don't hang straight, they hang off to the side I've tried to get them to hang straight but can't get them to I think it's defect in manufacturing,  so sad because I thought I'd really like them from the picture."
3.0,"Other than that, it is a really beautiful hat."
3.0,Nice but buy larger size
3.0,Belt too large.  Bust area too snug.  Order a size larger than what you measure
3.0,Neckline can get kinda wonky due to stretchy fabric.
3.0,"I love the ribbed pattern and the fit of the bottoms.  I ordered a small.  I am 5'1"", 130 pds.  I didn't really like the top ....only because I have small shoulders and one of the straps kept sliding.  If you have broad shoulders you'll be good.  I just put the strap that kept sliding over my head and wore it like that."
3.0,"These sports bras are ok, they fit fine, but the zipper slides down too easily. it is also bulky under a top."
3.0,"I love the beadwork (chain), but the pieces that attach to your glasses are way oversized and the catch that slips back and forth to tighten it so your glasses don't slip out, aren't snug enough on the grip so that anytime you take your glasses off, they slip right off the chain and fall to the floor.  I don't recommend this product because of it's inability to actually hold onto my glasses securely."
3.0,Thin material colour jst lik the picture. Its oky
3.0,I‚Äôm size 10-12 large is way too tight
3.0,These are cute little tops for the spring and summer. For those colder springs Temps throw a cardigan over these babies. In the hot summer months wear as is. Dress down and dress it up.<br />Here is where th con comes in. I had these tops for awhile and everything was going fine until the dreaded tag. One day the tag was just bugging me so I decided to cut it off. When I cut the tag off the seam to the side of top decided to open as well. The seam could've been sewn better. Be weary of cutting tags off and the way these are put together. If you're looking for a lasting product this probably isn't the best option.<br />Final notes are probably I would buy these again since they are a cute staple. I'll just be a little more careful with the tag and if you're sewing savy you could fix it. 6.5/10
3.0,Pretty design. Arm holes are cut a bit too shallow and the material is very thin and clingy. The bust area design was quite pretty. Returned because it was just too tight & clingy and showed every flaw in my not perfect body! Only a very thin woman would look good in this.
3.0,Very small and doesn‚Äôt look like good quality.
3.0,"Per usual, order 1-2 sizes up"
3.0,"My baby has really small feet but she needed ankle support so I thought these high top shoes would work well. Although her feet are really small, they are really wide and chunky. That being said, her foot would often slide around since it was so wide and didn't hug the sides of her foot. It is a cute shoe but didn't work well at all for good ankle support. It's too bad since I really liked the more solid sole."
3.0,"I wanted to love these. If I don‚Äôt move, they are perfect. Any movement though and they roll up and bunch at my crotch. :("
3.0,"Ordered this for a Christmas gift, the page I used only offered the size X-Large which is the size needed. Received a Medium instead of the X-Large. While the quality was great and our son absolutely loved it we had to return it. Upon returning it we found that we would have to take a refund and not a replacement."
3.0,"I love the way this looked, the red was a nice red. My furry child was going to look spiffy for Christmas photos- only problem is the thing broke after 10 minutes of him having it on. He wasn't scratching at it or being ridiculous-he's a lazy, zero given kinda dog. So that was sad. It was nice when he had it on.."
3.0,"Little tight on top, but overall it is cute."
3.0,"One time use only. They are a pain to put in, and after one use they are done. but they worked for what I needed them for (saving my wedding shoes)."
3.0,"I wish they had different sizes. One size absolutely does not fit all!! It was huge. But since it was very cute, I spent another $50 for alteration in order to fit it for my 15 year old son who is 5‚Äô 8‚Äù."
3.0,Sizing runs on the small side. Order one size bigger than you think
3.0,"Arrived quickly, comes in an adorable little bag, great for giving as a gift. I only gave 3 stars because I think the metal looks a little cheap. It's very shiny gold and the actual pendant is ok but the chain looks very cheap and fake. Wanted to give a better review, wanted to LOVE this, especially because of the price. :("
3.0,There is just one issue... the waist band is very small I can‚Äôt hardly get it around my waist. I only have a 32‚Äù waist and this barely fits even after adjusting the strap to as long as I can possibly get it.<br />So for anyone with a waist any larger than mine I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this apron unless you are wanting to find or make a new strap for it.<br />Other than the fitment issue this apron seems to be of great quality and it looks very durable.
3.0,Nice too. Looks good with a cute sports bra under kinda cheep but cute
3.0,It was much smaller than it showed on the picture!
3.0,you have to iron the skirt...but looks good
3.0,"The quality seemed acquit, however whit so many reviews saying to buy<br /> Larger that's what I did and it was too large. In addition I didn't like the out line of the padding in the top. Because it is too large I'm sending it back"
3.0,These boots are so cute but the sole has no grip so I will be returning them.
3.0,"I love this necklace, however, I wish the pendant was more genuine looking."
3.0,"I have to say I was very pleased with the presentation. The ring itself is comfortable and gorgeous. However, I found that the titanium metal has scratch marks in it. After a week of wear that seems a bit rediculous. I was under the impression that titanium metal was indestructible , boy was I wrong. I have my hands in water quite a bit. I do  not bang my hands around a lot and I am not rough so where the scratches are coming from, I do not know."
3.0,This dress is a little small to size. It was longer than expected.
3.0,"It's good quality but a bit small under the arms. Probably because the lace doesn't stretch. If you by a size bigger it probably fall of the shoulders...So, if you don't lift your arms above you head you should be ok."
3.0,The ring have some trouble on the car keys.
3.0,"For the money it is a fun outfit, I don't expect it to last with regular washing but if its dry cleaned the outfit could last a long time."
3.0,Very cute. Fit a little smaller than expected and a little thin though.
3.0,Received the masks with out filters. Sure glad i had already bought some filters
3.0,They fit snug so order a size up
3.0,The bra fits well the panties are very small
3.0,"Don't love the fabric, but the shirt is okay."
3.0,"With the wider straps, I was expecting it to be more comfortable.  I am keeping it but have no plans to order another one."
3.0,Use it for work id's and it keeps my wallet smaller. Use both at times for different reasons. Love the item.
3.0,The fit was nice. I actually could've went a size smaller since they have a little stretch in them however I dislike the fact that the jeans are not as distressed as the advertising  picture.
3.0,Nice sunglasses wear them to work
3.0,This was super cute and being a size 16/18 in most pants and dresses I was expecting this to be on the tight side. Once I tried it on I was really surprised at how well it actually fit throughout the body. The reason I am giving this three stars is due to the fact that the cups on this suit seemed both a little small for the size of the suit and a little awkwardly shaped. It's like I couldn't get comfortable in the top to where I didn't feel like I was going to fall out. I also thought that the legs of the suit would be a little longer but that's at no fault to the suit I just misunderstood. Over all this is a great suit and I would highly reccomend it but unfortunately due to the cups not being big enough for me (40D) I will sadly be returning this suit.
3.0,"Cute and fabric is soft, but once you wash them, they never lay right again."
3.0,"With the crown icon this looks like what it's meant to look like. Not bad at all - for the money. However the time keeping is less than accurate. I set this last and this morning when I got up it was over a minute fast. I have automatics that don't change that much, and by comparison, an Invicta with quartz holds right on - I checked that and it was right on the money.<br /><br />So for the money, it does some things right. Had a good bracelet but the clasp was horrible the worst I'd ever seen - it has SHARP edges that will slice you when you open it if you aren't careful. It's a shame because the bracelet itself is better than I expected. It has a Japanese movement inside (albeit a cheap one) and overall quality is decent for the price point. It looks its part. But if it doesn't keep accurate time then all it is, is looks - jewelry.<br /><br />My thinking is, yeah it's cheap, but spend a little more and get a watch that keeps accurate time. My Invicta I mentioned was about 15 dollars more than this so you really don't have to spend a fortune to get the looks AND accurate time.<br /><br />Basically what this is good for is to impress people who think at first glance it's a Rolex, and for wearing when you have to go into shady areas where some crackhead might try to roll you for your ""Rolex"" and you are thinking inside, yes please take it."
3.0,A couple of the socks were a little smaller but the ones that fit are awesome. I love wearing them inside my tennis shoes so my feet do not get so hot.
3.0,"The shirt was made of a stretchy fabric and felt nice. The skirt was poorly sewn completely. I had to resew every stitching. The skirt was way to short, it felt like if i bend down my whole butt would be revealed. I order a size XL but it didnt even fit me at all. The sizing chart really need to be fixed or something. The shirt fit but the skirt didnt. Im about 5'2, 5'1 and weight about 152 lbs by the way."
3.0,Got them on a friday and was not disappointed however by Friday after wearing for half the day the screw fell out on one of them and the other pair had a screw loose. Was disappointed with the fact they didnt hold up for a day. That being said they were super comfortable and i really liked the look of them. Sad part is i just wanted an exchange but now they are sold out of the ones with no nose pieces :(
3.0,Shirt does not look like the photo. I can tell it's the same style shirt but the buttons are different. When you receive the item it comes with snap on buttons as the photo is the classic style buttons. Sizing is always an issue with these shirts. If I order a size up I get the sleeve length right but the body becomes huge. Be cautious wash before you wear. I tried mine on straight when it arrived I got rashes form the shirt. Still a pretty good shirt.
3.0,the ruffles are flimsy and are not as stated and firm as the picture used to sell this item shows. Other than that it's an okay purchase.
3.0,I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and it was a tad too short in the length and sleeves for me but it was very easy fabric to sew and I put a binding on the bottom and sleeves!
3.0,"NOT AS COOL AS THE SCORPION- BUT STILL STYLIN'. LOOKS OK, ONLY CON IS THAT IT FLIPS WHEN YOU WEAR IT."
3.0,I did not get a dust cover and the tag did not say Made in Italy under the MARC JACOBS name.  Hopefully it is real
3.0,"I purchased a large and XL. The XL was too big and the large for well  What I did like:<br /><br />1. How soft the material is. Feels like butter on your skin.<br /><br />2. I got the green and pinkish color and they were just as pictured. Very pretty colors.<br /><br />What I didn‚Äôt like:<br /><br />1. If you‚Äôre someone with fluffy rolls/muffin top this type of material just sit on the rolls, clinging to them and just isn‚Äôt flattering at all.<br /><br />Overall I liked the quality and coloring. For someone who is slim and trim, go for it, for someone who is not you may not like it."
3.0,"The color should be burnt orange for Texas Longhorns, but it‚Äôs not!<br />Its more like a yellow orange!"
3.0,"For the price, not bad.  My only complaint is that they are a bit dark.  I'd like more visible light to pass thru.  Using while my Revo's get fixed"
3.0,Shirt is normal but the pants are very long & very skinny. My baby is thin but diaper changes are very difficult in these pants.
3.0,"Dress was delivered on time and looks like the pic shown. Was a lil long for me which I hemmed to as needed.<br /><br />However, its now faded. I washed it so far 4x since I bought it and utterly disappointed that it didn't even last an entire summer."
3.0,"The jacket warms nicely, but only in 1 spot.  The picture and description made it appear it warmed my back and upper back/neck area.  However, there are no heating wires in the back section, only the far upper back/neck area.  It does heat that area nicely, I just wish it warmed my whole back as I expected."
3.0,it is good but tight
3.0,I like them better than a stiff ring
3.0,"I bought this dress because my mother in law had bought one and it looked so good on her. I love the pattern, but I have to wear heels or it drags the floor on me. The material is different than what I was expecting. The one my mother in law has, the top part is more of a cotton shirt material, so it isn‚Äôt see through. This one that I ordered is more of a silky material and it is see through on the top. But that‚Äôs how it goes, you never know what your truly going to get. I love the dress though and I still wear it, just with a sleeveless shrug over it. Oh and I ordered a medium."
3.0,"Wanted this shirt to a be a bit larger so it would look cozy yet still cute, 5' 185lbs and usually wear a large shirt, I ordered an extra large...it fits like a 4XL...about 8 inches too long in the arms, hangs to the knees and looks as though I'm wearing a moomoo...."
3.0,"It was really cute, but a little bit uncomfortable in the arms and shoulders."
3.0,Much longer than shown in picture.
3.0,This was okay....looked fine with my outfit. However not a &#34;high end&#34; piece.
3.0,it was a wedding the bride change her mind after i order the dresses. this isnt something i would have brought
3.0,"The fabric is great, but it Fits very large. I ordered the smallest size and was swimming in it. (5' 8&#34;, 140lbs) I wont ever wear it."
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and these aren‚Äôt full length on me. They fit like crops, hem hits mid calf. So disappointing because they fit great elsewhere. (28 waist, 35 hips, size 6) but because of the crop the ankle hem is tight on my calf and I don‚Äôt feel very confident wearing them."
3.0,"walking but bring pain on  LATERAL  peroneus muscle tendon , ALSO THE SOCKS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIT at the begining"
3.0,It needs two buttons on sleeves for better adjustment. Sleeves a little too loose fitting.
3.0,"They are stylish and nicely designed; however, the 2.5 version is too strong for my eyes.  My husband can use them and I will have to look for a pair at 1.5 strength."
3.0,"Between my 2 kids, I've purchased these glasses 7 times. I love the look of them, but I'm tired of having to replace them because they quickly break. I took too long to learn my lesson. Now I'm searching for a different, unbreakable option. Buy only if your little one is careful and gentle with their belongings (unlike my 3 & 5 year old boys)."
3.0,"I'm a die hard Ford guy and a Ford flat billed snapback is not easy to come by.  In that respect, great find.  On the down side, it's only 70% cotton (30% polyester) unlike a New Era at 100% cotton so it fills flimsy and a bit cheap. The ""carbon fiber"" had a crease in it when it arrived as well.  I like to put a slight upward bend in the bill of my hats and this hat doesn't allow that very well.  The carbon fiber wrinkles up.  All in all, at least for me, this is a great hat for the man cave."
3.0,"It is super cute, but not as slouchy as I wanted"
3.0,They also had a whole in them.
3.0,"Sizes run very small. Crown is too short for me.  Hat looks great, though."
3.0,"The band is very good and looks like it's made of good material, but I was sent the completely wrong color and I would like to wear my watch today and not next week so I'm just going to deal with it. Other than being sent the wrong color it's a fairly good band"
3.0,The fit wasn't flattering and the fabric is cheap. Wrinkley and thin/clingy
3.0,It's really cute but it was bigger than what the size chart recommend it. I will order a smaller size the next time.
3.0,I ordered these for my husband who wears an 11 but they arrived in a size that is too small for me and I wear a 9 other than that they feel very soft and comfortable would have gotten 5 stars if the size was correct
3.0,"meh, I thought that it was sweatshirt material, I thought it would fit loose and &#34;foldy&#34;"
3.0,"I‚Äôm typically a medium, but this top runs small. Definitely size up one size as I had to exchange for a large."
3.0,"Too small, took forever to get here, smelled weird and arrived with a whole"
3.0,It was good.<br />Worth the money
3.0,I got the 2-3t for my 17 month old who‚Äôs 29lbs 33‚Äù and it‚Äôs way long! She wears 2t stuff but this must fit more like 3-4t. It‚Äôs a cute outfit though. Just size down.
3.0,My son is a very skinny 6'3&#34;.  He usually wears a small and we bought this in a medium.  The arms were still too short but we were afraid to go up a size because he didn't want it to fit loose on him.  The color was very nice and it worked out ok for the wedding he was in.
3.0,"These shorts feel cheaply made. First, they run small. They do not wash well. I'm very disappointed especially considering the cost."
3.0,"The sweater is cute and the &#34;holes&#34; are well stitched into the fabric so they don't get worse with timw.  That being said, it is cheaply made,  and the fit is not anatomically correct (the sweater is long,  and the sleeves are just as long). The material is scratchy,  and there is a funny smell coming out of the item when opened (admitedly,  it does come out with a good wash adding some vinegar). Also,  it is not black and white,  as the white is more of a cream color. I will keep my sweater as I already washed it,  but honestly I would pay maybe $10 for it tops."
3.0,This shirt had a strange shape to it. Very large in the armpit and side area. Looked boxy. Sent it back.
3.0,I'm giving this 3 stars only because of the color. I ordered the teal band and instead of teal it looked like a mint green. So buyers beware if u want a true teal color you might not get it. Colors vary because of screen lighting and pictures. Other than the color however the band fit perfectly on my fit bit..looked exactly like the original  (aside from color).
3.0,Don't waste your money. I bought a 2 x and a 3x.  The 2x was larger than the 3x.  Very very sad quality of the fabrics. The stitching was raveling after the first delicate wash.  Forget about these.
3.0,I followed the size chart but it still fit too snug to wear. Bummed!
3.0,Wife loves the way they feel
3.0,Looks like the picture. Would order on size up from your size so L or XL
3.0,Had to assemble latch with no instructions. Looks good
3.0,"Es demasiado puntuda, mucho mas de lo que se aprecia en la foto."
3.0,"I purchased these beautiful earrings in Oct. 2018, it is now Jan. and they have already broken the little piece that attached the hoop to the stud are detached.  Beautiful earrings but flimsy."
3.0,I give this watch 3 stars because of the short band length. I had to return it because it would not fit my wrist. Overall a very handsome time piece.
3.0,Cute dress. Runs small. Not one bit of stretch. Returning.
3.0,"Perfect fit for my US size 38i. Great supportive daily bra, not so much as a sports bra *FOR ME.* NOTE: I had a back injury years ago was looking for a truly supportive sports bra that would help prevent clicking in my spine when exercising (powerwalking and light jogging), so it failed as a sports bra for my special circumstance but it makes a great daily bra (I work in retail on my feet all day)."
3.0,"The quality of the tail and ears is great, very soft and sturdy.  The attachments are awkward.  The tail which is nice and firm has only a slim piece of silk ribbon string to tie around your waist...my daughter promptly tied it in a knot that required cutting to get off which meant my ribbon string was not too short for her so I had to reconstruct it.  Maybe a wider piece of ribbon, elastic, or something with velcro would be a better choice.  The ears are entirely too top heavy for the bobby pins that they come attached to.  The flopped over and flipped every direction except the correct one.  I attached them to a hand band to keep them in the proper position."
3.0,"I like that these bands are light weight and comfortable; however, the colors are not like what is shown in the pictures. The bands I received are like the neon versions of the colors shown. I‚Äôll keep them, but I was disappointed with the colors when they arrived."
3.0,Cheaply made. Low quality but fits well.
3.0,"This sign is &#34;okay&#34;.  The description says it's made of &#34;durable plastic&#34;, but it feels like cheap cardboard.  It's very thin; about the thickness of a dime.  Overall, it'll work for my needs."
3.0,"Very cute tank top! I bought it for working out but I think with some cute necklaces, I could wear it out. The back is cute because you can scrunch it to how short you want it. I was surprised because it‚Äôs already pretty small so if you want a bigger fit I would definitely size up. I‚Äôm a medium and I got a medium in this top but it feels like a size small. Overall I‚Äôm excited to wear it to the gym. The front it plain but cute w leggings or shorts!"
3.0,"Great,  would give it 5 if the lock system was stronger"
3.0,Nice feel. I‚Äôm a large in 85% of my tops. I think a medium would even be too big. So your guess as to what size you would be. I haven‚Äôt been a size small since HS and I‚Äôm 50
3.0,"Runs small, I usually wear 2x, this dt3ss runs small, I need 3X. the top part of dress is made of thin material, the bottom red part is good material. order one size up. overal reall nice dress I like it."
3.0,I had read reviews that sounded horrible about this purse however it is not to bad. The handles are holding up fine and so is the zipper. I have carried now for a couple months and even gotten compliments on it. For such a small price it has done its duty and still going strong.
3.0,I ended up returning mine because the seem in the front and the back made the dress feel awkward. Had the seems not been there I'd have kept it. It fit well otherwise
3.0,has faded a decent bit in the last 3 months
3.0,Blocks out noise I'd say about 85%  but they are very small and tight around your head and you can't adjust them.
3.0,"After washing them the first time, they shrunk, no longer 11&#34; X 11&#34;, they are now 8&#34; X 8&#34;. But I can still use them."
3.0,Didn't feel sturdy last rain storm.
3.0,"I‚Äôve worn these twice and they ripped down the middle - between my legs. Both time I wore them, it was for leisure wear.<br /><br />The material of the pant is very soft and the color is beautiful - but I was really disappointed in the quality - due to the rip."
3.0,Hard to put in hair. Needs Bobby pins didn't stay with the ribbon. I would buy the one that had elastic all around with the same front next time.
3.0,"runs long, okay shirt. The quality seems good."
3.0,"Cute, but a small chain."
3.0,"The quality is barely adequate. All stitching of seams -- all of it -- is crummy. You may need to do some reinforcement yourself. Button stitching is good. Material heft is just barely acceptable. The description of ""65% of polyester, 35% of cotton"" is false. The multilingual garment tag clearly states 80% polyester and 20% cotton. Laundry tag indicates that you are not supposed ever to wash above 80*F. Item seemingly made in Germany but could NOT be so, due to piss-poor quality. They probably farmed-out production to lowest rate Chinese fabricator. The only good thing to say is that the camo pattern colours are excellent and true to photograph. And sizing was correct as expected. Can make these work but shall probably not order again. Might be best as an overgarment during winter hunting or whatever."
3.0,These are seriously the most precious earrings! Unfortunately my ear stud broke within the 1st hour of wearing them. So sad!
3.0,"I like the soft, stretchy, lightweight fabric. However, the fit isn't as cute as I thought it would be. It's somewhat boxy and squares out the waistline...wide though the sides. This top truly is oversized. I normally wear medium to large, and the medium is quite roomy on me."
3.0,I got these smaller than normal because I read other reviews about them stretching out. I can see this happening very quickly. I returned mine because the skirts are very see through and that was not what I was looking for. The material is very soft and silky feeling and they fall nicely. I also liked the long length.
3.0,It's beautiful but you can't wear it to go out.! Only at home üôÅ
3.0,Nice shirt but I don‚Äôt like how you can‚Äôt pull sleeves up!
3.0,Good for night vision but not for bright headlights...when driving on 1 lane streets
3.0,"I think the sizes run on the small side.  I received an XL and it's very snug on me.  The bottoms are tight and binding.  The top is a better fit.  I'm 5' 10&#34; at 160 lbs.  I thought an XL would be loose but it isn't.  If ordering, you might want to go up in size.  The material seems very durable and the suit is well constructed.  One complaint though - the plastic protective strip in the crotch leaves behind a gluey/sticky residue that didn't wash out.  It may wash out over time but I have never seen that in a bathing suit before."
3.0,Purchased the size 11. Fit like a 9. Small and tight.
3.0,"Too small in the hip, too large in the bust (and I'm very large busted). Unless you are thin or have equal bust to hip ratio it might not fit. Returned without incident."
3.0,the seller is very attentive but the earrings are very big-- too big for my taste. It is hard to tell that from the picture.
3.0,"they pretty small, colors to bright"
3.0,"Feel good, holds on alright; but falls off quickly when ever removing the glasses making it easy to lose either or both. Upgraded to the full off official sight for cheaper."
3.0,Change the color... Not good
3.0,"As reference: I'm 5'2, 105lb, 32-22-32 measurements.<br /><br />It's waaaay too long on me, I could do with it being like a foot shorter than it is now. Not for shorties like me!<br />Also, the waist is a bit big. It's elasticated, but if I were to wear it I'd need a belt of sorts.<br /><br />The colour is absolutely gorgeous and the material is a good material, on the heavier side for a summer maxi, which gives it a good drape."
3.0,The metal is thin and not very heavy.
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress. I just wish they had it sized correctly. I ordered a 2x, what I got was an XL for a child. Come on! If you are going to sell women's clothing, put the correct size on it. These charts are not correct in any shape or form."
3.0,I got these for work wore a few times and washed already coming apart
3.0,"It fit as i expected it to, definitely a cheeky bikini. The biggest problem is with the top. The material is too far apart and my nipples constantly come out so if you have any boobs this top probably wont work well for you. Other than that, the color is the same as the picture and the material is nice."
3.0,I love the cut and style it's very comfortable but after only wearing it from one season it already has several holes in the fabric so not long lasting at all.
3.0,Just remember that they are from China so on the small side...
3.0,"Its a bit too small. Thin fabric but thanks to it being dark red, its not see through. They should add another layer to stitch."
3.0,Had to bend out of shape to put in.  Hard to reshape
3.0,"These were nice, but fit too loose and broke easily"
3.0,Beautiful but definitely not the size they were advertised as.  I couldn't fit a single one in.
3.0,This dress is made out of a polyester knot...it's nothing special.  I will wear a printed long shrug over it to give it a little something extra (which it needs).  It's made well...just not the best fabric and kind of drab.
3.0,I WEAR SMALL WHEN I ORDER DRESSES THROUGH AMAZON IM VERY PETITE SIZE 3 TO BE  EXACT BUT THIS DRESS WAS NOT FIRM FITTING AT ALL :(
3.0,This bathing suit actually fits great. My problem with is that I ordered navy blue with white polka dots and I received black with aqua blue polka dots. The colour combination makes it look like it should be for a little girl.
3.0,"The fabric just isn't what the picture is. It's cheaper looking, but i almost expected that from Amazon clothes."
3.0,"These shirts were very thin. I read the comments to see what size I should order and they were VERY deceiving!! I am a small frame person. I weigh 115/120 lbs, B cup bra. I ordered a small and it was very tight on me. I noticed some people were saying they were 140 lbs and bigger breasted & ordered a small & it fit fine..NO WAY!!! Mine was tight in the breast and was not skin tight in the belly but not far from it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and they are long. I also don‚Äôt think they are authentic. I‚Äôve purchased Nike shirts from sporting stores & they are thicker shirts."
3.0,Didn't work too good in my pool returned it.
3.0,"I love the way it looks, but it's difficult to read the time."
3.0,"Bought ""boys"" size but it was quite big. Was a nice bracelet though."
3.0,This dress was fun for the price but the material is comparable to a cheap children‚Äôs halloween costume. Definitely buy a petticoat to go under the skirt of the dress or else you‚Äôll be very disappointed with how it hangs like a wet blanket.
3.0,"Hay modelos mas lindos para la playa o piscina. No esta mal pero esperaba otro calce. Es correcto, no compraria otro."
3.0,"Sorry , but don't find them to be very comfortable which makes them quite annoying."
3.0,Its nice quality=price
3.0,First off I loved everything about these boxers when I first got them. Currently I dont have them anymore because they both ripped up. Both ripped around 6 months of use.
3.0,This is cute but it's like a bolero and I'm 5'4&#34;!
3.0,Ordered it for a 10 year old granddaughter and not sure it will fit her. Very small.
3.0,I bought this 3x for my husband. It fits me (I'm L to XL). Nice product. Just not sized well.
3.0,The knot does not lay as natural as the picture shows.
3.0,"Oh boy, what can I say about this leather belt! It was sure stinky and smelly, well it‚Äôs leather right, but after a week of having it the smell still there. My husband like it, tho the buckle is too big is just so uncomfortable he said, doesn‚Äôt look slick or nice, makes the belt look vintage old not like the picture that look very modern and stylish. I received a completely different belt which had a metal buckle. If you got the original version all black belt than disregard my reviewed. I‚Äôm reviewing for the bock leather, big metal buckle one."
3.0,It was a stretchy interesting material sewed together kind of strange fit but I like the pic on it
3.0,Don't like the way it clings between the breast.
3.0,"I really liked the style. But the white is see-through! so you would need a slip. I returned it because I do not want to wear a slip.  It fits as expected.  I am 5'10"" and it wasn't too short."
3.0,"These are terrible, scratchy not soft at all and cheap  thin material.Would returned these but wasn't within the return period since I was out of town."
3.0,"Didn't realize this was cotton before I ordered it, but otherwise, if you like a long cotton cami, this is it. Slightly more pale/pink than pictured. Nothing spectacular."
3.0,"This is prettier in the picture than up close. I thought it would be a soft lace but it was more like plastic. Several of the beads fell off during shipping and were in the bottom of the bag. That said, it is quite pretty from a distance and I will probably wear it a few times."
3.0,Like most dresses the breast area is more for A cups. Better not have boobs the model is not an accurate preview of the space.  I have use a shawl to cover what the dress distorts
3.0,My package came about 3 days late. But the rings themselves are okay. Definitely on the cheaper side but what do you really expect for this price.
3.0,"They're cute, good material, but they're were too small for my 3 yr old toddler. This well fit like 18-24 month old. I purchased 7/8 toddler."
3.0,I bought these because I needed a pair of silver hoops.  I like them okay but have found that the part that inserts into the earlobe starts to hurt after a period of time and they must be removed.  I may get used to them in time but it will certainly take a while.  They are pretty and they are a little larger than I usually wear.  I would recommend them to anyone who can wear the larger type hoops.
3.0,I felt that some where smaller and some where a true medium.
3.0,The female mask was covered in glue.
3.0,"These are cute, but run a bit short. The other pair I got was larger and they were ordered the same time. I think I will be able to make them work though."
3.0,"These bras are super comfortable, and the band and cup size fit as expected. I normally wear a 42A or 42A, depending on the brand, and ordered an XL. However, they lose their shape & support after a couple of washings, even when air dried, and the removable pads move around. I'll keep them for working in the garden and around-the-house comfort, but they're too shapeless for much else."
3.0,"I ordered a large which is what I normally wear, but this shirt was hanging on me.  I'm 5'4"" so maybe a taller person wouldn't have quite such an issue with the sleeves.  Also I felt the shirt was on the thin side, almost but not quite see through."
3.0,"I wanted white, I got ivory."
3.0,"Cute and good material for the price, just runs a while size and a half too small. My daughter is lanky and the biggest size was a size and a half too small. Good for girls up to 5 years of age, after that, I feel it‚Äôs too small for older girls."
3.0,"I love the suit with the exception around the ankles.  It's not fitted.  Very wide, which sort of destroys the purpose of the suit.  Good quality other wise."
3.0,I had to stitch up the side where it had come unsewn.
3.0,"Too tight for me, but I have big feet. Ordered the right size but just a bit too tight. Looks great but not terribly high quality."
3.0,dress is gorgeous but I ordered a small and it fits like a large :/
3.0,"Purchased a Med. Too small. To fit it would have to have been an extra large. I returned it. The style was great. Fabric was here nice, not flimsy."
3.0,I took a medium but should of taken a small.  I'm 135 lbs and 5 feet 6 inches.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:52dd040daed28789d8775145ce657b16]] Me gusta el dise√±o pero la correa no me gusto mucho, solo llevo un mes de uso ya se rompi√≥ pero para proteger el watch es excelente por doy 3 estrellas"
3.0,Beware: the white part on the top is completely see through. I ended up puttin a black tank under and it looked great. I also added a black under bust corset because the lace up part was really lacking. I liked the way the skirt part hung though.
3.0,These are light weight.
3.0,"These are beautiful jeans, and thankfully I sized up a few sizes because they do run really small. I usually wear a size 6, and I believe I ordered a size 42. While these are really nice, I don't think the quality is that of a 40 dollar pair of jeans. The fabric is quite thin, and the embroidery has loose threads and what feels like bits of glue (?) everywhere. They also had a bit of a weird smell. I'll probably keep these because there aren't a lot of places to go shopping in my area, but I do think you could probably find the same quality of jeans for 15 dollars at Forever 21."
3.0,I like the scarf but it's too short to wrap around.  I will be giving this to my 6yr daughter.
3.0,Size is extremely small for an XL.<br /> i do like the look and the material.
3.0,It looks cute but the clip doesn‚Äôt hold as much. It keeps slipping from my dress.
3.0,"The dress is very pretty, but completely see through. I personally would not  wear this without a slip of some sort. However, I can‚Äôt imagine wearing a slip during the hot summer months. So I returned it. Would buy in a heartbeat if the material was not see through."
3.0,I expected the material to be more of a satin or silky look but it has a more stretchy material but regardless it is still a very flattering dress!
3.0,I got extra large and it was still small and narrow but my son was still happy
3.0,Very pretty dress!  I wish it were longer though. It's really only good for a bathing suit cover up. I got an XL and it is still SUPER SHORT!  Butt Cheeks will be showing as I walk for sure!
3.0,"The picture is true to the colors, they are strikingly pretty, which is why I ordered it. I thought it was going to be a necklace, and I am not sure how to describe what it is.  It is MUCH TOO LARGE to be a necklace, in my opinion.  I think I will probably wear it with a scarf to hang down through the scarf's folds."
3.0,Fast delivery but blouse is not white... it's light violet.
3.0,no son buena tela
3.0,The price was great and the size fit but the design is quickly wearing off. Its also rubbed off on me and stained my skin metallic grey. Took rubbing alcohol to get it off.
3.0,"I thought this was a cute swimsuit and I loved the length of it. However, I ended up returning it because it did not fit well on top, even when you could tie it up to your liking. For reference I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs and the top of the suit was a little too big and low. Otherwise, it's a cute suit if it fits your body type well."
3.0,"Great reading glasses but they only focus on the screen if I am right on top of the monitor.  My work station places the monitor about 24 inches away, which is too far for the focal length of these glasses.<br />Anyone know of computer readers that have a further focal length, so I don't have to lean forward into my monitor?"
3.0,Not the best quality. Threads falling off. Still going to give as a gift but not too excited over them. Ordered a different pair to compare the two.
3.0,"This dress is super comfy and the top is super cute. The skirt is see through though!!!! You can see the liner!<br />I actually intend to re-line it, or do something to alter the skirt because I love the top half of this dress."
3.0,Too small I had to return it :(
3.0,It is cute but the legging are too long.
3.0,The only problem was that I thought this was for kids. It‚Äôs actually very large even for adults. So she know that when you purchase this.
3.0,"Beautiful bracelet, unfortunately, not tungston nor ceramic and actually stainless steel."
3.0,"I think this will be the warmest and coziest hat I've ever owned.  That being said, in person, it isn't quite as nice as it looks on the model, (but that's usually the case anyway). It doesn't sit quite right and certain areas bulge where they should not or are indented where they should not be. The flower isn't as big or pretty as I thought it would be.  I'm worried how it will look after washing as well. This hat will need very gentle handling when washing as it will be very heavy when wet."
3.0,"I bought these for my teenaged son to wear under his fencing gloves.<br />These gloves are not soft, they are tight, the very top of the fingers are rather crudely trimmed, creating a rough ridge that eats into the fingers.<br />Even though they are thin, but try making a fist, and you fill that they are in your way.<br />We can not use them as we intended. Sadly the gloves are now purposeless."
3.0,Much much shorter than pictured.
3.0,"It's cold this time of year in the Pacific Northwest, so I hoped this would be good to hold off the winter chill. It actually looks really cheap, like a low end stuffed toy. It does feel warm, like, sweat-inducing warmth. It made me overwhelmingly hot and sweaty, then itchy. I just can't recommend this at all."
3.0,"Not as good as previous pair.  These are very thin, flimsy even.  I don't think they will last very long.  The description says mirrored but mine are not but they are polarized!  I will not buy these again.  I will go back to my other purchases and buy those again."
3.0,"I do like these, but the quality isn‚Äôt the best. Plus the black color came a little smaller than the others. They fit great, but I don‚Äôt think they will be long lasting."
3.0,My daughter put it on and the chain broke.  But love it otherwise
3.0,I bought this for my husband. It is very light weight. It almost feels cheap but he wanted one that was not heavy so it fulfills it‚Äôs purpose.
3.0,Color came off finger quickly with play
3.0,Not best quality. Thin gloves were black and small hole between fingers. Inside hat and neck piece came black as well. Disappointed.
3.0,"This was ok, but turned dark after little wear. Great design though!"
3.0,ya get what ya pay for!
3.0,It kept slipping off my head while i was asleep.
3.0,"these things crumble to peices if played with by the children in my neighborhood.  I've seen them on the front lawn and they are vigorous dual weilders.  I use them just as props and for making corigraphs(and duel weilding concept forms) for movies(casually) for my own visual references while playing Knights of the Old Republic.  The sentinal yellow sabers can be made out of any yellow thing around the house or a transparent plastic roundel and yellowing wraping paper(seran sandwich wraps) around the bulbs.  Yellow sabers were not in the movie and they are a class of character for the RP games.  Episode II did have a few yellow jedisaber wielders in the big battle scene in the planet Korriban arena(with all the monsters).  Sentinals, unlike Guardians and Consolers are skilled at many things other than just ""combat"" and are generally stealth experts ship or droid mechanics, or security hackers.<br /><br />if you want a sword, take up a expand/retractable TV antena(loosly fit) so you can 'flourish' it like these kids here do(or two if dual wielder). just don't poke anyone in the eye or scare my cat!"
3.0,too bulky to wear with shoes
3.0,"I bought these four months ago, and wear them 1-2x each week.  The enamel rings are in great shape, but the &#34;silver&#34; bands started turning brassy within a month of first use.  For the price, I can't complain too much.  Sizing was perfect."
3.0,It's a crop top not a tank
3.0,I got this for a Christmas gift from my kids. It's beautiful! The 2nd day I wore it it started to turn my finger green. So that's unfortunate. I just keep it in my jewelry box now.
3.0,The quilted collar doesnt fold over easily it's quite stiff.
3.0,It‚Äôs not amazing but it‚Äôs what it looks like in the photo. Not a bad product at all.
3.0,"Love the color, material and look"
3.0,"Bought these for a Junior High production of Alice in Wonderland. These barely fit the three girls who were the Cheshire Cat character, who were tiny in size and height. Ended up having to cut into the waist band to get them to fit.  Look cute from afar, but won't ever order them again for any future theatre productions."
3.0,"I was under the impression that these were genuine casio made watches, after looking reviews online and the back light of the watch delivered was way different and dimmer than what was supposed to be. None the less, it has all the same features, works fine, and if it wasnt for my own curiosity, I wouldnt have been able to tell the difference. Its a good watch for a decent price"
3.0,"First: This watch is not an Automatic Self Winding as advertised. As it turns out the NH35 Seiko movement is a single function movement that would be used in a GMT or Submariner. The ""Sport"" (Daytona) is a quartz movement watch. Mistake or False Advertising? I can't be the first to bring it up. Second...The watch appears to be very well made starting with the stainless bracelet w/  actual screws (and well machined ones) for the links. (Big deal). Solid back with simulated sapphire crystal and a vivid black dial with polished sub dials. Not only is this watch a very well made and a unbelievable homage to the Daytona? It's just a nice damn watch!"
3.0,"Color is pretty and fits well however,  I'm still working on getting a weird smell out of it and also it has a fuzzy look to it, which i didn't see in pictures...it looks strange."
3.0,I ordered a size up and still the shoe is snug.
3.0,They're okay but I would probably buy a better quality product next time
3.0,Just got these and they aren't too bad.<br /><br />Pros:  Nice material.  Super comfy and feels great!  The colors are fantastic!<br />Cons:  The waistband is not &#34;sturdy&#34; like other boxer briefs and rolls up at the slightest movement.  The band seems to be made of the same material as the briefs.  It's a shame really.  I would've bought more if the waistband was stronger or more rigid.
3.0,It's more orange than red.
3.0,"Dress looked okay on. The pockets hit right on my hips so if made me feel very conscious of how much wider my hips were. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, with a 30in waist and 40in hips. I ordered a Medium ans it fit perfect, not too tight not too loose. I will return the dress because of how the pockets hit on my frame. The material is like a polyester combo and it‚Äôs more flowly than ‚Äústiff‚Äù as the photo suggests."
3.0,was ok but had a concave back so looked a little cheap. it looked better in the picture and it was hard to read.
3.0,had a small hole in the knee area straight outta the box.
3.0,Came in to small
3.0,It was way to big and I had to return it. It seemed like the quality was good though.
3.0,Item ran small for the listed sizes but I can make it work.
3.0,for a size small I found it too big for my 12 year old
3.0,"Top is super cute, but bottom is meant for girls with essentially no butt. I bought a Large, I am 5'2 150 lb with a normal B-C cup. The top was a little close to my nipple and the bottom wouldn't fit in a million years. If you have a small figure this suit would be cute."
3.0,"It's a beautiful beach coverup however, wish it had more width to close front."
3.0,"I ended up keeping us because it was comfortable and I liked the color, however I kind of wish I didn‚Äôt because it really adds a lot of volume makes you look much bigger. Also the fabric seems to get dirty very easily. Might work better on small girls."
3.0,Loved the way this shirt looked in the pictures however when I got it it was a little short and the material was all but comfortable.
3.0,These were for use with an EMT uniform.  The fabric lost its softness in the washer and is not as comfortable as when first purchased.  They do the trick though.
3.0,"Love the hat, fit a little snug"
3.0,Listen I really would like to help the next person this tank runs small my size is a large so got a XL because I read the tanks runs small I didn't know they run this small XL fits like a medium so don't be afraid to get a size twice as big
3.0,beautifully made. it is too small.
3.0,"This is a nice dress, it seems nice quality, but I had to return it because it was too big for me. I already purchased a different dress so I did not try a smaller size."
3.0,These socks were a lot thinner than I thought they would be. Some of the patterns make the stitching stiff and not easy to put on or take off. Good price for what you get but would rather get a different set next time.
3.0,Was a little smaller than what I thought
3.0,"The hat works great, and my son loves it, but it definitely fits smaller than most Flipeez hats.The page lists it as fitting &quot;One Size Fits Most Youth (Manufacturers Age: 4-12)&quot;, my son was only able to wear this at age 4. It is very tight on him now at age 5, I actually bought a replacement one for him at Target to give to him this Christmas that has a bit more room in it. My 2 year old has a Paw Patrol Flipeez hat that fits my 5 year old much better than this Batman one."
3.0,Definitely not meant for long term use nor should you wear them everyday! They will turn your nose green if you wear them for too long but overall still a cute accessory üíö
3.0,"I bought 2. Both looked great, but one of them had the leather string around the arrow thingy fall off after a few days of use."
3.0,"I was looking for a pair of drop earrings and found these online. I really liked the way they looked and bought them. When I took the earrings out of the package, I liked the fact that the puffed teardrop earrings looked exactly like its picture and felt solid; however, the stem on one of the earrings was bent and misshappen. Instead of returning them, I tried to fix the stem. I can wear them but was dissappointed that they were received damaged."
3.0,"Really loved it, I got the white lava stone one and wore it all the time. Now after having it for a few weeks the inside of the beads are turning green... I tried washing it with a toothbrush but nothing seems to work... really loved it otherwise"
3.0,"I like the design, however, the tummy part slides down constantly and it rolls.  I have to, in the middle of the workout, pull it up constantly...that's not fun and annoying."
3.0,"its material is cheap, strings hanging all along lace, i was disappointed ! probably give it to goo will<br /><br />the shirt was a little small the material seem cheap, there were strings hanging all over the bottom lace, the picture looked good ,i was so disappointed, i guess i will donate it to good will. lesson learned, not to order without seeing it ;"
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE my ring!  It is exactly as described & what I wanted.<br /><br />On the other hand, the vendor leaves much to be desired.  I was told it would be here in a certain date & it didn't show up until 2 weeks later.  Communication is nonexistant at best.<br /><br />Bottom line....they have a great product, but if you're in a hurry or end up with a problem, this is not the way to go!  As much as I love my ring, I will definitely not :c"
3.0,LOVE these - the color and quality are perfect but the snaps are backwards? The raised snap is on the lower portion making it awkward to put on. But after my son‚Äôs cleft lip surgery he had to wear arm restraints so he didn‚Äôt hit his lip - these didn‚Äôt have to go over the head and had long sleeves so his arms didn‚Äôt rub against the restraints.
3.0,"I brought this because it had a removable strap and I knew I could use it as a clutch as well, however, when adding the strap, I got one clip on and while doing the other side, it broke at the base of the clip leaving the strap useless. Luckily I was able to use it as a clutch, but super disappointing. Believe this is a manufacturing issue."
3.0,Looks like the picture however it does run small. This is only for fashion purposes-if you want to go skiing or even play in the snow nope!
3.0,Not a very good fit for my glasses but they keep the glare down.
3.0,Bust is small will have to wear a lace bralette underneath
3.0,Marterial a little see through
3.0,Nice but a bit large..Fits well when tucked in like the model pic.
3.0,"I loved the look of the band, but it would not stay tight on my wrist"
3.0,"Top fit great, bottom is a little saggy. will have to wait to wear so my daughter doesn't show off her front butt to someone."
3.0,Really wanted these to work for my<br />Father. There was no security while wearing them. He felt like he would fall while wearing them.
3.0,The sizes are off.  Running a bit small.
3.0,"I think the material could be sturdier and they run very small in size.  Material is 80% cotton, 18% Dacron and 2% Spandex so I wouldn't recommend putting them in the dryer.  However, they may be washed with other items.  Some people have a hard time keeping these on their babies.<br /><br />I wish they ran bigger so they could be used when the baby actually starts crawling.  I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this but it's a nice idea for a product and worth a try if the price is right around $3.  They kinda surprise you with shipping fees on this one (regardless of Prime) so be aware of that.<br /><br />The folks at Blackcell were nice enough to provide me with this product at a discount so that I could evaluate it.  Therefore, I agreed to provide honest feedback when posting my review.  Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product."
3.0,"Too small, size up needed or maybe 2 sizes up fit wasn't good."
3.0,Kinda small it‚Äôs hard to get a really thin scarf through it
3.0,"It seemed like a decent purchase, at first. Sufficiently roomy, well constructed. However, upon use (and only light use, as my middle schooler only attends school 2 days a week), the zipper broke within the first month, and a hole has started to form at the bottom seam. I have bought $5 backpacks that have lasted longer. Shame."
3.0,It‚Äôs a cute dress but you can see straight through it. :(
3.0,"They are loos fitting wear on a day you don't care what fits,very well, color is great"
3.0,It just needs more room for your boobs. I have 34B size boobs and I purchased the Medium and it barely fits my boobs. They are kind of squished. Also I have a bubble butt and this suit is way too small. But the suit is very cute and I loved the price.
3.0,material is very thin and does not hug your body
3.0,I love it but it is kinda big for my ear but I can still get it in it‚Äôs just a snug it‚Äôs nice that the piece comes off so if you want to put it on a different barbell you can or if you just want to wear the barbell by itself and just us the stone for special occasions
3.0,"I had low expectations for this dress which was the right thing to do. Warning it is shorter than pictured, stopping at an awkward length a few inches above my ankle. I am 5'4&#34;...so this dress I would not reccomend for leggier people.<br /><br />Bright colors, slightly larger polka dots than shown, and a slick plastic like feeling.<br /><br />Cute and simple and airy for summer or a quick cover to go out in your bathing suit.<br /><br />Don't hate it, not loving it."
3.0,Too tight around the arms.
3.0,"Cute style, but thin. Item description indicates they are thick, but they definitely are thinner than any wool socks I've every owned."
3.0,"The item came as described and fit true to size, but the material is cheap and the dress is cheap and the pockets don‚Äôt lay right on the sides"
3.0,"As described, as expected."
3.0,"Good quality, there were flecks of what looked like white lint, a quick wash fixed that. The dimensions/size is smaller than advertised, but I‚Äôm still able to wrap and use it as normal. Just takes a little more work."
3.0,I do not know that I received these! Soon maybe
3.0,"For the price this is great, especially on sale, but I can‚Äôt wear it all day."
3.0,"i did have a stone missing from one of my earrings but its no big deal, i really like it though."
3.0,"sweater fit was okay but the arms are much too short. It had some funky dried glue or something on the cuff, but laundered it and it came off. Kind of had a very chemical smell.......not good. Also it was not white at all. More like a light grey. I did keep it and it looked well made so that was a postive."
3.0,Didn't really make a whole lot of difference.
3.0,Only three pins.  Not four.
3.0,Nice quality material but if you have bigger breast it‚Äôs small. Maybe too cropped
3.0,it's OK
3.0,very pretty but extremely too long it sweeps the floor. great for a really tally person.
3.0,"What can I say about these rings that hasn't already been complained about? Yes they're cheap, and they're crappy, but you get what you pay for when it comes from china. I still think they're cute and fun to wear, my favorite one which was the V thing broke after a day and I've only worn the two other midi rings but that's all I really wanted."
3.0,"I wear a size 8, so I decided to purchase one size larger (9/10) and they are too small. I really bummed because they are so cute and comfy."
3.0,"i usually where small or medium. i ordered a Large, its a bit loose on the hips and chest but its very hard to take it off. if i would have ordered a medium it would defenetly not fit.... weird fitting not so pretty fabric too."
3.0,not as bright as the picture shows. it looks like a man's scarf. I was looking for a purple/gold/yellow and I guess it will serve its purpose but don't expect to get any compliments.
3.0,"It's very cool in hot weather, which is what I was looking for. But, after washing it's very wrinkled! For the price, I expected better quality."
3.0,I purchased this as a gift for my niece for Christmas. I am sure she is just going to love it.
3.0,"The combat book looks nice, but it is a loose fit also I call it the tongue does not lay flat under the shoe strings cause the way they are stitched, you can‚Äôt pull them to lay down."
3.0,Bought as a gift for a friend. She wasnt that big of a fan.
3.0,"Pretty , heavier than expected. But bracelet charm broke off once it took out of bag it was sent in"
3.0,Fit well and nice versatile dress but I am 5'7 and it hits above my ankles which is shorter then I would like
3.0,I thought this was amazing until the black paint started chipping after wearing it only twice. :(
3.0,It's a nice leather bag. I like the trim. The way the bottom is stitched is a little strange.
3.0,The pretty cool looking but the plastic kinda sucks.
3.0,"It seems small , even though I came to customer specification hat m"
3.0,"The dress is not bad. Just it is just a bit short, it barely covers the appropriate part of my body."
3.0,"These days with masks, etc, these tend to fog up too easily especially when brought in from colder weather into warmer. Otherwise, they are great!"
3.0,order at least a size up
3.0,This product is good for the price so keep that in mind when purchasing. It did not stay in my nose at all may be different for someone else. For the price is good.
3.0,I doubt this is real pewter.  It comes on a crappy black thread cord.  but it's not ugly or garishly large.  i wear it alot
3.0,I returned this blue because it is so bright it looked cheap next to a true sapphire.  I liked the ring & that it's sterling - may order the black or red just to try again.
3.0,Shorts fit well but I‚Äôve worn them twice now and the one cap fell off of the drawstring.
3.0,"these earrings are very heavy on my ears and did take a long time to get here, the good side is they are interesting and pretty and match anythign"
3.0,"Runs small, more like a girl bracelet"
3.0,returned it. not what I wanted
3.0,The shirt isn't red all the way through the inside is white and it seems like they just sprayed the outside with color. Fits properly. Very light weight.
3.0,"Good gift for older kids. However, they seem to loose their glow over time. It might be better in black light, I have not tried that yet. They are just a fun peice of costume jewelry."
3.0,"At first, it was flattering, comfortable and beautiful.<br />Then after just one wash, it looked like little cotton balls were stuck all over it, even thought it was washer alone, in cold water and air dried.<br />So the material is not good."
3.0,The shoes looked as pictured. They'd aren't comfortable for running at all.
3.0,I purchased this bag as my last one lasted 2 months. I don't abuse my bags but I use them everyday. I bought this off of the reviews. A few months I got out of it. It's already ripping on the inside and stuff is transferring to other pockets making it a nightmare to find things easily. The front pockets are built and stitched well but that's it. If you use a bag everyday get a tactical EDC rugged bag as these Chinese made bags are a waste of money.
3.0,CHAIN WAS BROKEN WHEN IT ARRIVED BUT i REPAIRED IT.
3.0,It‚Äôs nit as long as it appears on the picture . I‚Äôm only 5‚Äù6 and it‚Äôs Abbie my ankles.
3.0,"This is a very nice design and solid piece of jewelry. Unfortunately, it's a very small size and won't fit all the way around my ear enough to stay on for any length of time. Too bad, it's very pretty."
3.0,Well the girl modeling this def looks better in it. I bought the white one. Its see through which I'm not thrilled about. Looks better in the picture. But some of the reviews and pics posted by other customers seemed happy with it. Guess it depends on the person and their taste in clothes.
3.0,Love this ring. I get so many compliamemts
3.0,"I agree with a lot of reviews that it is too short. I'm 5'6, so not very tall...I got Blue-A9 and while it is very pretty, I cannot stand the feeling of my ankles being exposed. If it was calf length it wouldn't matter but it just looks and feels awkward. I think it also runs a bit small because I normally wear between M-L and this large is tight in the middle. I didn't have too high expectations but I still don't love it like I would if it were maxi-length."
3.0,"The good: The dress is super comfortable! It fits great, it is soft, the colors are great. Very very pretty dress! I would say it fits solidly like other dresses I have, although this dress may run just a tiny bit bigger. I loved the fit and comfort of this dress so much, I ordered another pattern as well.<br /><br />The bad: After washing in cold water and line drying, it shrunk! It still fits fine in body (just a little tighter), but it is at least a few inches shorter. Also, the color ran slightly. This is a big bummer."
3.0,Fits prettttty tight but that's a good thing.
3.0,"I love the look of the band, but getting it sized took some trial and error.  The clasp is also difficult for me since I have hand tremors.  Another problem is one of the decorations on the bezels fell off at some point."
3.0,"I bought this bra hoping it would be comfortable, but it's not. I bought the correct size 40 according to the size chart, but when I measured it out against my chest, it was six inches too tight. This causes the band to curl, which drives me crazy, and it exacerbated the back fat look. I had to stop wearing this bra because it was strangling my ribs. When I took it off, I could finally exhale. So if you do buy this, get the next 2 or 3 sizes up. Unfortunately, I can't return these because it's been too long. So I will donate it to the Salvation Army."
3.0,"Ped√≠ talla 6x y me lleg√≥ 5, si no hay la talla no deber√≠an ofrecer."
3.0,"These are just as shown, plain old gold ball earings, which is what I wanted. The problem is that the the space between where the earring and where the thread begins is too much. So when the backs are screwed on all the way they don‚Äôt sit flush against your ears so they constantly look like they are about to fall off. People constantly tell me that my earring is about to come out; quite annoying."
3.0,La blusa es bonita pero me quedo apretada de pecho tama√±o Medium
3.0,I love the bottle part the sprayer does not seem to be working well at all!
3.0,"Love the sound but, hat is very small and too tight."
3.0,"This is not necessarily the product manufacturer's fault, she has a high arch on her foot--but my daughter could not get her foot into the sandal from the low straps on top. Must return."
3.0,"It was well made and looks great but a bit large. I'm waiting on the company to process my return.  The suit gets an overall 5 star rating. The return process however, is super slow."
3.0,"Seems a bit overstuffed because after a few short weeks of my child playing with it, the seems started to come open. Sewed it back to close it myself."
3.0,"A little snug, but they're ok."
3.0,"This is soooooooo cute but disappointed in the material.  It has never been dried and starting to look bad, not pilling but very worn looking."
3.0,Too small in my breast area I am a 40 c 180lbs. Ordered a Large
3.0,"Super sheer just as other reviews noted. Sleeves were longer than what, in my opinion, they should be on a summer dress. Not a horrible dress but returned."
3.0,OK but larger than I needed
3.0,The color is amazing. The material is shear so a slip underneath will be required. I am a little disappointed that the dress did shrink a little  after the first washing in cold water. It is incredibly comfortable to wear.
3.0,"I am a small for everything, the top fit perfectly (I'm a 32B) but the bottoms were WAY too small. I kept the bathing suit because of the price, and just bought black bottoms. The quality is pretty good as well!"
3.0,"I ordered two, I have twin boys. They both arrived in good condition and I haven't had any problems  with either charm."
3.0,"Good quality and great looking, but was a little snug to be an xlarge."
3.0,"Of course these are wood, so don't expect the plugs you get to look just like the picture. I wish the pair I had received looked more like the picture, but they're still pretty. Be sure to have some sort of oil because you'll need it when wearing wood plugs. Overall, these are pretty, but not my favorite. This company ships orders very quickly which is always a good thing."
3.0,the dark grey &#34;paint&#34; chips off quickly.  I thought it would be the actual color of the metal
3.0,"If you have a small hand, this is not for you.  It is the look you want but, it just didn't fit my hand.  It rolled from side to side because I had too much slack from finger to wrist.  It was also wide and I couldn't use it.  If the snake part had been smaller, I might could get away with it but there was just too much give.  I ended up giving it away."
3.0,I think it is very pretty.  It‚Äôs very tight fitting in all of my bracelets so it‚Äôs hard to remove
3.0,"Pros: This is a cute set. It's stretchy and flattering. Feels thick. Padded bra top.<br />Cons: Although the material feels thick, I could still see my black underwear underneath so I'd recommend if you're going to workout in this then be in the comfort of your home or wear thongs....but who can comfortably workout in thongs lol. I ordered the large because of my hips, but the top was a bit big on me. The straps kept falling down on my shoulders. I think I should've went with a medium maybe."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:b728f08d935c8ab26d559df080223e32]] I love this band so much. It has weight to it and sparkles so well. Feels like I'm wearing an actual watch instead of a smart watch. Only thing is that this band will start turning your wrist green after a few years.
3.0,CHAIN IS VERY LONG
3.0,"Arm holes were low and the pattern made it look weird on the waist. I covered the pattern mistake with a belt.  It was ok, but I wouldn't buy another one.  It is like t shirt material."
3.0,"I got two blue and one silver band. It‚Äôs supposed to be one pink, one blue and one silver. What do I do here??"
3.0,The fabric is thin. You can definitely see undies. Material is stretchy and okay. Better leggings than yoga pants.
3.0,Overall fit okay. Sleeves slightly above my wrist. If the sleeves had been longer I would have kept this shirt in a heartbeat!
3.0,Super cute but definitely runs smalls. I wear a 38D and the XXL barely fits my breaststroke and is a little tight.
3.0,Buena tela pero no tiene muy buena forma
3.0,Product is blurry and faded. We can barely make out design. Border is torn and not stitched well. Giving a 1 star for blanket and quality.. 3 for cuatomer service
3.0,"From the package it looked cute and my teen was excited for straps off her neck. Then she tried to put it on. Yeah....tried. She's a solid XL in the bust and she was coming out of it everywhere on top and sides and the bottom would not lay flat. Buyer beware another Asian clothing brand cut for child waifs, not American women.."
3.0,"I ordered a size large and it was ok over my body armor, the sleeves were a little tighter than I would have liked. Would go with the XL if I was going to do it again. It would fit well if I wasn't wearing the full armor. I'm 5'10"" and ~175#. The jersey itself got  pull in it before I even got it on the first time, by the end of the first day it is a little abraded where the clip for my camel back sits and a couple more small pulls. The others guys made fun of me cuz I looked like Charlie Brown but I just roosted the s#!t out of them and they shut up. It matches my kit and is going to get destroyed the next time I crash anyway so it was worth the $20. It will work till I get my team gear in.  Don't think your getting a pro quality jersey."
3.0,Ordered an xl but it fits more like a snug large.
3.0,"The band is very nice! But beware of the face, it does NOT FIT the 44mm. I took pics of the side view and from the bottom of my watch facing down. I didn't know how else to show that it is too small."
3.0,Little different from the picture
3.0,You get what you pay for. Broke the next day but was super cute when worn.
3.0,Too heavy on the ears
3.0,"These were way too small. I am going on a vacation. .I will wear them with a vest, and trying to make it work."
3.0,Material is cheap. Ripped the first day
3.0,I don't like the fabric but it's a nice little dress
3.0,"Seems like pretty decent quality control, bit too small."
3.0,"Great my son fixed well, but the leather on top difficult to cover the pants"
3.0,"The magnets are super strong. They may work for some people but for me, it hurt my nose after about 5 minutes and almost started bleeding. Also in my opinion, I wish the stems were a little more circular shaped instead of straight out."
3.0,"The good: these are really comfy, soft and have good stretch. I was super excited about the back pockets...<br /><br />The bad: the back pockets. They are in such a weird place my rear looks walleyed. My arse looks like Sid the sloth from Ice Age. I know I have a generous hiney but come on! The pockets are way off on the side!<br /><br />I did like the pants enough to order some without pockets but I‚Äôm disappointed in these. I‚Äôm wearing a long sweater to hide the ridiculousness."
3.0,"Pretty necklace, but broke the 2nd time wearing it!"
3.0,"For the money it's great, but as an everyday writer it's heavy and writes like a nail. I have had no problems with the pen's performance. My Lamy Safari is a better pen for everyday use , of course it cost more but not that much. ."
3.0,"Lots of pockets, fits in my Herschel backpack well. Smell is TERRIBLE--a cross between chemicals and tobacco."
3.0,"It was suggested that I ordered an extra large, I am usually a large. The sweatshirt is BIG but the sleeves are extremely short. The sweatshirt decal is very nice."
3.0,These are very average leggings.  I had greater hopes for them.
3.0,I‚Äôm a size 12/14 and bought these shorts in a size large. These shorts were tight and in this size was see through when I bent over. I‚Äôm sure an xl would have been fine.
3.0,"It looks a little cheap, I like it but no love it"
3.0,"It's ok, but the colour is too subtle to notice the pattern well or see the gold and silver distinctly. Personally this is a pass."
3.0,"Nice product, but larger than expected."
3.0,Not really what i expected. Its basically a clear shell with a skin on it.
3.0,"I bought these as a gift for a friend and it is a lovely set but I really hated the packaging.  The jewelry came in this cheap plastic and made , the whole gift look cheap.  I recommend taking the jewelry out of the packaging and buying something more tasteful if you are gifting it.  Otherwise the set is pretty but kind of cheaply made. Not bad for fashion jewelry but the price was too much."
3.0,I really have been wanting a denim dress so I ordered a couple to see which would be best. This one was frumpy and the shoulders and arms were way too small-I tried it w/a nice wide belt but the shoulders were too uncomfortable so I sen t it back.
3.0,They squeak when they get wet.  But fix good
3.0,"was hoping there were more like cotton cloth, but they are thin and a little satiny/silky. So they tend to slip back on the hair after a short time. The color is faded as it stretches, so the pretty color is muted once on your head. I'll use them, but they arent my favorite and not for workouts, wont absorb sweat and dont stay put long. I like the design but wish for a lot of changes. And I wish it had the no-slip grip on it. (I got the camo ones)"
3.0,It looks different than the picture. It is one color.
3.0,For but the to was like t-shirt material...
3.0,Bought for my Granddaughter at her request. She likes it.
3.0,"I love the concept and convenience, but the case does not fit &#34;snugly&#34; around my phone, the phone could pop out at any time. Other than that - I love the product."
3.0,It‚Äôs a super cute shirt but if you‚Äôre a bigger girl this is not gonna do you any favors. I‚Äôm returning.
3.0,Doesn't sit centered.
3.0,"These were nice bralettes. The price was great as were the colors. There was a little too much fabric for me, and the fit was loose. I wear a 34C bra and the S/M was a little loose. If you need more coverage and support, this could work for you."
3.0,"this is a cute shirt especially in gingham, but was not big enough for a beach cover up. I ended up returning it and getting a white one in a larger size."
3.0,It fits perfectly fine.
3.0,"I bought this watch because I liked the unique color of rose gold with a black face. When I got the watched I was able to inspect the details more closely. The band isn't as shiny and expensive looking as I would like. The face also has too much of the color white for my taste. This is a big watch and it looks better from far away then up close.<br /><br />There are definitely people who will really like this style, color and uniqueness of the side buttons but it was not my taste. Overall, if you want an expensive looking watch then this will not work. But if you want a unique, large watch that looks like its worth about $50-80 then you might like to add this to your watch collection."
3.0,The lenses are a bit small but the glasses came fast and the color is awesome!
3.0,"Love the colors. They wash OK. I'm a 10.5 ladies shoe, you can see in the photo where the heal section fits. They are not tight in the foot and toe area but the ankle/calf area is small on all their socks, these ones are a bit tighter than some. I have to fit them at a very particular spot so my regular size ankle/calf isn't smashed so much. When they are pulled up to have no wrinkle, they're constricting. I always have a mark from the socks. Cute though. Fun gift. Not good for regular-ish size ankle/calf's or larger."
3.0,"Not good quality, but was cheap. I'm medium size and fit me perfect with not room."
3.0,nice hat just way too small
3.0,Great compartments but too small to be ideally perfect. Thus a 3 star only.
3.0,Too shiney.
3.0,"Extremely dainty, won't last long. Pretty concept though but needs to be made better."
3.0,"Dress is pretty,  well made, just as pictured. I am between m and l. I reccomend if you are between sizes go with the lower one."
3.0,"There is too much fabric around the toes‚Ä¶ In the width. It bunches up.  If I pull it up so that it‚Äôs not all bunched, then the heel pulls up past my ankle. FYI‚Ä¶ I take a Womens shoe size 8-8.5 M and bought the small/medium socks.  If you have a very wide toebox, and long toes, this may not be a problem. Otherwise the sock would be five stars‚Ä¶ Good compression, material and colors.  Maybe they need to offer a small, medium and large sock.  And they should taper the toes like most peoples feet."
3.0,It was okay for the money. The color was beautiful. The fit was great.
3.0,"It is a bit stiff and I washed it. It stayed just as stiff and shrunk a bit more. Not bad, but not worth what I paid."
3.0,Beautiful. The girls will love them.
3.0,It looks OK after I rig it with safety pins because there is too much material.  Drying it did not help
3.0,The color of this dress in &#34;pink&#34; was not true to what was pictured and therefore not the color that I expected.
3.0,"You cannot snap your fingers because material is to hard and steady, lights did not work"
3.0,"Cute, soft, and vintage appearance, but it was too small. Order up!"
3.0,"Overall cute mask and good for the price. This mask does run a little small and is kind of an awkward shape/size. It does not come down far enough below your chin or high enough on your nose, which makes it a little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. It is a little heavy, but breathable. The graphic is beautiful. Machine wash on gentle and AIR DRY ONLY."
3.0,"The necklace was perfect for my daughter , only issue is when she opened it as a birthday gift the chain was broke. She is only 5 so she was excited for it and I had to give her a chain from one of my necklaces because she insisted on wearing it right then."
3.0,Size chart is off.  My calf and shoe size both put me in size small.  So that's what I ordered.  They actually hurt my feet and I needed help in getting them off.
3.0,Runs a bit small and no bra support.
3.0,Wish it was longer and made out of cotton instead of polyester.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt feel a thing. I only wear for the style since I purchased it
3.0,"I would say these run small and do not stretch much.  I'm 5'8, 126 and I ordered a small.  I normally wear a small.  The tanks fit- but they are not as long as I thought based on reviews (boo) and not as stretchy as other tanks I've bought.  I'm going to keep them but still on my search for long Camus.  These barely cover my behind.  Maybe a M would have been better.  I just received so I will update this review if straps break."
3.0,I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 150 lb and usually wear size 6. I ordered two sizes up which is a 10 and it was too large and also very short. But I tailored it so it looks like cute cropped jeans.
3.0,Overall the swimsuit is okay. It looks flattering on my body the only issue is the padding at the top. My boobs look really far apart and oval shaped. I am a B cup but I look almost flat chested in this bathing suit.
3.0,I bought  a medium  ibweigh 150lb  n its too big smh
3.0,The size was to small not what I had expected .
3.0,"Cute, they got the job done"
3.0,It pills really bad.<br />But other than I like it.<br />Oh and if you bend over my phone falls out of the pocket.
3.0,"Quick delivery, packaged with care.<br />Item fits me like a dress..I am 5'3'.<br />Great purchase price Deal of The Day... Negative fo r me... fabric is thin/see through...undergarment  is a must."
3.0,"bought these thinking they would look like the picture, but they dont at all. the colors are fine and I like that they came in a pack of 3, but they are much shorter than I had hoped and the opening kind of squeezes my legs which surprises me because Im very skinny, a size s or xs in everything. overall three stars because I will still use them, but they arent really what I expected."
3.0,Fit as expected but I ordered burgundy and it's red in color
3.0,"Larger than I expected, but I like the larger ones, has plenty of pockets. The zipper gets stuck some but that's probably cause it's new."
3.0,Some of the beads are not drilled through the center making for a cheap look to the finished product
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, and thought it looked so cute on the other people that posted pics, but it was a little snug in the shoulders and the shape of it basically would not allow me to move/bend without it riding up, or showing more than I would like (to give some perspective I'm only 5'2&#34;).  I wish it was just a little longer so I could've worn it comfortably."
3.0,It's was awesome while it lasted but it broke the day after I got em. You get what you pay for!
3.0,They are pretty. But I already lost a ball. So I can't wear them both.
3.0,"The legs were way too long so the pockets seemed mis placed, i returned for full refund  without any issues"
3.0,"This earrings are very cute but they are smaller than shown.<br />I expected something little bit bigger, nice quality."
3.0,"The hat looks great. This company does a good job promoting on social media. The problem is, the product does not live up to the pictures. It looks good, but is obviously made from cheap plastic and other materials. The hat feels like sandpaper on the inside. It doesn‚Äôt come down to my ears, and I don‚Äôt have an enormous head. Could‚Äôve earned a lifetime customer with such innovative designs."
3.0,"The suit is so cute! However, I did read the reviews stating that it  run small and to size up so I did  and it was still too small! I would recommend buying the swimsuit because it is very cute and flattering. With that being said the sizing is totally off. Make sure if you buy the suit do you size up at least one size if not two!"
3.0,Very cute costume but the fit is very body hugging tight; good thing the top is very stretchy! The dress is very short also. The only real issue are the gloves the fingers on the ones I received are way too long on some. Easy fix & decent deal for the price
3.0,"I have another pair of Just USA Jeans that I love, so I wanted to try another style.  These didn't fit quite right for me so I had to return them.  The color and feel was nice otherwise.  Just didn't fit as well as other Just USA styles on me.  Order a size up if in question about which size to choose."
3.0,"Maybe having the dimensions or a size chart would help. Fabric is lovely, pieces of costume are very exceptional."
3.0,Material feels more like yoga pants. I was hoping for a warmer material for winter.
3.0,textile is so fragil.
3.0,the eyes on the costume just lay down don't stand up like show and can't stand unless you figure away to do that so not to happy with it
3.0,This dress is ok but not as flowy and loose as I would like. The coverup is also very short and I will only use it while making a quick return to my room at the resort. It is not something that I will wear to an outdoor restaurant etc. I think it may be more suited for someone that doesn't mind a dress that cover just the backside and that is it. The teal color is a true teal and different.
3.0,Looks nothing like picture. And are run extremely small. I am 5'4 127 pounds. Ordered a size medium and had to return.
3.0,Very comfortable.<br />Would recommend üëå.<br />But please be aware that lengh is very much different between colors.<br />Why??? No idea.<br />Returning sunflower pattern. Its way too short. I am 5'2. 125 lbs
3.0,"This runs pretty big. I usually wear a size 12-14 and it's quite large on me, but I love the comfort and look anyway. I usually wear it around the house on those hot muggy days. Of course it is an adorable bathing suit cover up, but beware that it wrinkles a lot, so if you are going to pack it in a beach bag or suitcase, it will come out a wrinkled mess and only some of the wrinkles will fall out while wearing it."
3.0,Very cute and my son loved them. The slinkies do come off the glasses a lot and need to be put back on.
3.0,Somewhat small for my daughter who wears size 8
3.0,Size runs smaller that expected.
3.0,My 4yo niece liked it but I couldn't get it to light up. It's almost like there isnt any electronics in it. Any answers would be greatly appreciated.
3.0,"This is a nice sentiment.  The saying is on a card inside the cover of the box, it's removable.  The piece is nicely rendered and artistic.  But it's way too delicate for a true keychain.  Those little wires in the elephant's ears would not hold up to being throwin around with a bunch larger meetal objects (keys).<br /><br />In the photo, I have the elephant pictured with a nickel, for size reference.  This keychain would get lost amidst a bunch of keys.  With the box, though, it's a nice giftable item.<br /><br />I am going to attempt to make this into a necklace instead of a keychain.  I may then give it as a gift, a more sensible gift.  This honestly looks more like jewelry anyway and I would love it that way."
3.0,"I ordered this to wear for a casual wedding. It‚Äôs cute and comfy, but the fabric seems cheap, and not quite dressy enough. I am keeping it anyway to wear out to dinner or on a beach vacation. Some maxi dresses are too short on me, but the length is perfect."
3.0,"Los relojes en apariencia son bonitos pero por el precio se entiende que no duran mucho, algunos meses nada mas y luego se oxida."
3.0,"Bought them for computer use at night. Not attractive, but do the job."
3.0,The zipper on the easy access on the back of the bag has broken and will not zip up. I have tried and tried to get it to zip but I will not work properly. Only used for 7 weeks.
3.0,Plate was bent. Chain of as tied together.
3.0,"I give five stars for the jacket, but unfortnately the legs could barely fit me. They could, but i had to struggle. The shorts stayed on alright though"
3.0,Bought these for work only lasted 2 weeks
3.0,These shoes were a 'must have' for my 9 year old son. He loves the look but they weren't as 'springy' as he thought. The blades are hard plastic and can be very slippery when wet. Sometimes the blades 'click' because the plastic is loose.  NOT good for biking or anything that the blades may get caught on.
3.0,spaced out kinda strange..but real beads
3.0,I will return these since i see it will take away from the safety factor....unless ?
3.0,"Compren una o dos tallas mas grandes de lo que regularmente usan. Yo compre este pantalon una talla mas y me queda se√±ido al cuerpo.<br /><br />No es de mala calidad, la tela se estira muy bien y se siente comodo. El largo es indicado para personas de estatura 160 de altura o 5.3. En la cintura si queda un poco apretado, pero no lastima. Tiene bolsillos, pero se pueden ver claramente lo que uno lleva en ellos. En la parte de al frente, se puede ver un poco transparente. Recomendaria usar ropa interior de color piel para que no se vea lo que usas por dentro."
3.0,Light weight and sturdy hat for safari and hiking. It was just a little small for my large head
3.0,"This was a really cute dress, but it was way too short for a tall woman. I'm 5'11 and ordered the size large. It fit great at the shoulders, bust and waist, but it needed a few inches in the sleeve and hem length."
3.0,Useful for senior citizen
3.0,Still having trouble in putting this on...its super confusing :-( Somebody please help lol
3.0,It fit a little on the small side and I'm a true medium. Definitely order a size up for a comfortable fit.
3.0,It looks much better in the pic. It's too long and looks like a moo moo dress.
3.0,Useful the period of time I needed to use them.
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter in law, but the material is very thin and it looks a little cheap!!  She is young though so we will see."
3.0,"I was so excited to try this line of bras. I've read some great reviews, and the modularity seemed fun and useful. The quality of the product seemed good, too.  But, when I received the cup today, I saw just how comically small they are. I can't believe how far off they are in size; I placed my order based off the company's sizing chart.<br /><br />I was also really disappointed in how padded they are. The description mentioned light padding - i was hoping for something closer to ""lined"" not a cup that might add a whole cup size (totally unnecessary after a certain point!). I still like the idea, and I have more pieces coming, so I think I'll try again. But... not happy with the sizing chart or excessive padding at all."
3.0,These do not hold together very solidly. The heavy half will slide off and the next thing you know you are missing half of your earring. I do not recommend the. I found sturdier acrylic ones in a 12 pack for nearly the same cost. These are expensive and don't do the job thought they were very pretty and comfortably light weight.
3.0,Great fit but the material is too cheap.
3.0,"Great quality shirts but super small. My toddler daughter loves Minnie. She was turning 2, and I bought 3t, but they only fit over her head for a few months. Only one of the shirts fits now. The head hole needs to be bigger. Maybe order two sizes up if you want to use for a while."
3.0,It was very tight on top. I order extra large size  and I am a size 12-14 ( 5'5 170lbs)
3.0,"I like the length of the tees, but it seems to have to much room in the waist area compared to other brands that I like. Tried these because I heard about them, but probably not my favorite."
3.0,LED lights in the sole quit working quick!
3.0,Only post its okay but it ran small but the item is actually pretty nice and great quality. If your a man US XL - you might want to something else to order
3.0,"Material feels very thin and plastic like. The pockets came up so high I was cupping my boobs if I put my hands in them. Even for the cheap price, I don't think I‚Äôd recommend this jacket."
3.0,I like the soft fabric and the color. It‚Äôs good for the cheap price.<br />The cut is not very flattering with my big boobs and it was short on me.
3.0,It‚Äôs very cute. But it broke after wearing for an hour.
3.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law.  It is a nice looking bag - I bought it in the light green color.  However, she had not used it 2 weeks when the metal label came off on one side.  She could no longer use it and was afraid of getting a replacement and having the same thing happen.  I did request to return it for a refund without any problems at all."
3.0,"Nicer, heavier material than previous version. Nicely stitched, thick waistband, but the sizing seems to have changed and not for the better. Less room in the seat and crotch. Not happy about that! Lounge wear needs to be loose fitting and comfortable."
3.0,"The print is only on one side.  Other than that, it seems like it will be fine.  Time will tell."
3.0,Followed sizing and recommendation ‚Äî while beautiful and soft and all the great things they are TOOOO BIG and move around UNCOMFORTABLY :(
3.0,Fits smaller to size; the stone is huge and duller colored.  Otherwise it is a nice casual ring.  It reminds you it is on your finger!
3.0,"I love the colors of these tanks and the price is not too high.  I am 5'3"" and weigh 120 pounds.  I usually take a size small and I bought these in a size small.  They were way too long on me and they were really low in the under arms.  They fit okay in hips and bust.  I love the colors.  I was disappointed they did not fit correctly.  I could have taken the shoulders in and hemmed them but that is too much work.  I returned them for a refund."
3.0,If this is a small.I wonder what a large is! Not made very well at all.Mine came looking like the stitching was off.
3.0,"This is a nicely tailored sweat shirt, of generally good quality.  However, Russell, in my opinion, has significantly cheapened the product by using a cotton blend fabric weight that is far lighter than shirts of this brand that I've purchased in the past.  Perhaps their US made all-cotton sweat shirt maintains their former higher quality standards, however the color selection for the US product line is highly limited (...based on what I see offered on Amazon).  In sum, if you're looking for a sweat shirt of high-end quality this is not the product for you."
3.0,"Super cute and nice thickness but not happy with the fit. I wear 9.5 women's shoes and my calves are 17&#34; around, so I ordered the women's large. The foot portion is really large and bulky, causing bunching and rubbing around my heels and toes. Then the top cuff is not stretchy enough and is extremely tight almost to the point of cutting off circulation. I can't wear them all day. Disappointed."
3.0,I bought these as a gift and now I hesitate to give them because they are bigger than they look in the pictures. They're just this side of gaudy.
3.0,"super cute!! was a great hit for July 4th vacation, my boobs were a little too big and the clasp in the back broke, hopefully i can find a way to fix it!"
3.0,It wasn‚Äôt very easy to get out in and keeps moving a lot and poking the inside of my nostril and gets stuck inside the piercing where both ends of the ring meet. Kinda painful to wear when it moves around. Makes washing your face super hard to do.
3.0,"I love the pin designs, but the quality could be better. The back of the black cat pin snapped off a week or two after my SO put it on her bag. The other one is just fine for now but I feel like it's only a matter of time."
3.0,"This looks and feels fake when compared side by side with an actual sterling silver turquoise ring. It‚Äôs very lightweight and the stone/metal has an odd veneer. It‚Äôs decent quality for the price, though, and it won‚Äôt turn your finger green."
3.0,I love the idea of this for my Fitbit but the one and only thing i really do t care to much for (and this is why I gave it a 3 star) is for the necklace üò°it just tangles all the time and the chain twist .. it kinks a lot kind of tired of trying to smooth it out.. but love the round circle decal on. The chain .. I think they should of used a better chain
3.0,"These slide on my10 months foot, so gets a little frustrated pulls them off and chews them.  Maybe i thought it would get better as he grew, but he grew out of them to fast."
3.0,"Love the color and style but way too small, ordered a lot larger for hubby knowing that they might be small and still don't fit."
3.0,"I really like how vibrant this band is.  Many friends have noticed it and asked if it was the new apple band.  Of course, I reminded them that I have a samsung watch!  This band was very high quality at first, but now after a couple of months, it has started to fray a bit and the black rings are scratched which is disappointing since I am not an active person so not sure how they have gotten so scratched.  I think this band is worth it, but I am curious if it will look good for much longer."
3.0,I love it! But the chain that connects it likes to break very often...
3.0,"I bought 2 sizes larger and they were still too small, clingy.  They are nice light weight material.  But once again unless you are 5'8' and 117lb<br />then once again items like this are just not made for you."
3.0,It doesn't seem like it is that durable since the leather is so thin. It also is not very woman friendly that are full chested.
3.0,"I wanted to try the thinner size.  Its the same but it constantly flips over in the front so it doesn't stay on my head for very long.  The other size is a better option for me.  I have no ""shelf"" on the back of my head so most things wont stay on.  The silicone they put at the forehead works great.  Still love the company just not this thickness."
3.0,"The umbrella is heavy and the stand wobbles.  If you choose to stake the legs into the ground it would be fine, but using it on a wooden or concrete deck, any amount of wind will blow it over."
3.0,"Lights don't last long.  Also, they keep on turning on by mistake whenever you make certain movement with your foot. Other than that, my son love these shoes because they have the &#34;cool&#34; factor and everybody stops him to ask him about them."
3.0,Runs bigger than expected. Ordered an xl end it fits like a 2xl
3.0,"Good product no problems, works well for the job intended."
3.0,These are women's and much smaller than a tradititional hanky. It is a nice quality but it is not unisex.
3.0,wear a 12 bought 12.5 should have got a 13
3.0,I like the light material. Size is just a wee bit big but that's expected cuz I ordered them so my son can grow into them. Besides being to big right now he loves them. I'm sure in like 3 months they will fit perfect.
3.0,Loved the earrings other than the metal part that goes through the ear falls off easily from the leather
3.0,"Cute bra but I went up a size, my usual size is a Medium (32b) and I got a large and it was still too tight. It took me a min to get it on and then it just squeezed my back in all the wrong places.Will have to return sadly."
3.0,NIce but flaps a bit
3.0,This dolphin is very well done but it is too small for the price I payed!!I had to return them for this reason!!
3.0,"Holds glasses very well, comfortable around the neck"
3.0,Very odd material bathing suit material. Not what I was expecting. Will keep it as a beach cover up.
3.0,Pretty okay
3.0,"The mask arrived quickly, is really cute but too small even for my little 5 yr old grandson.  Would be cute for a baby."
3.0,"Mostly 14g, and barbie plastic, but not bad for the price."
3.0,"This sweater is super cute. The length is definitely much shorter than pictured. (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and it falls about 4‚Äù below my hips.) The other measurements match the size chart. The material is a little scratchy, not soft and comfortable as described."
3.0,"The jacket is good, nice and warm. The zipper is not a good quality one. It keeps getting stuck or it opens up."
3.0,Bulky not confortable
3.0,"It's cute, but it barely fits around my ankle. And I am pretty sure I have normal (if not smaller than normal) sized ankles haha...Keep that in mind when ordering this. A little bit more chain would be nice."
3.0,Not the best piece purchased. takes a lot ot put this together and comes with tools.
3.0,"I ordered 3 different prints all in the same size Large.  The striped dress was pretty thin and ran smaller than the others. The red and blue prints fit better and the material was a bit more substantial. I thought I would like the pockets but the openings bulge a bit making my hips look even wider. They were all a little low cut for me and if I tried to pin it closed it didn‚Äôt lay right. Also, the pattern in the blue dress got a bit discolored when it was stretched too much."
3.0,I was excited about the product because it had so many pockets. As soon as I opened it I knew it was not going to fit but fingers crossed I tried anyway. As expected it was too big
3.0,"Very pretty, decent quality. Zipper on the side makes me look oddly lumpy. Fit is smaller than expected. Go up a size or two."
3.0,Runs small. Get 2-3 sizes bigger .
3.0,Above the knees for me 5'8
3.0,So tight on my head. Headaches like crazy.
3.0,"If you have small head, these caps are not for you. I wore the black one while I was working  in a covid unit and it literally swallowed my head. Too bad I can't return them anymore..."
3.0,Cute but polyester do it does not tie well.
3.0,Not horrible but is cheaply made couldn't really tell the front from the back
3.0,"its cute but it doesnt really fit me it is pretty low and it shows my bra a lot, 13.99 for that is kind of a waste"
3.0,It's daintier than I thought it would be and hard to clasp and unclasp but still a nice bracelet.
3.0,It is not a true large!!!
3.0,This set is ok for the price.
3.0,"Really Cute style, but poorly made. The asthma sign fell off the second time I wore it. 3.21.18"
3.0,Material is not what was expected. Feels kind of cheap.
3.0,Very poor quality design/image. Looks like it was stretched out too much and slightly pixelated to fit bag. Wallet is definitely not built the best. All of the card slots were too small to fit any of my cards. Accidentally broke both folds from the bottom of the wallet on both sides. But for the price it could be worse. I still use it daily.
3.0,"The watch itself works well and looks nice. However, the battery died rather quickly after just a couple months of use and the replacement battery costs almost as much as the watch. Hopefully this new battery lasts longer."
3.0,"I love the watch I ordered yellow the first time I got it, it was rose gold so I returned it and reordered yellow again and it was again rose gold it would be 5 stars if the color was actually correct"
3.0,"Material is very thin, after opening I was shocked from the smell......put in washing machine right away, hopefully after washing and ironing it will look better, belt is very cheap looking as a material. Usually you getting something better for $30"
3.0,Really cute image but the material quality is poor.
3.0,Nice nighttime scarfs but not adequate head wraps because the fabric of the scarfs are very slippery. They do not stay on and I‚Äôm constantly having to retighten them throughout the day.
3.0,"Very comfortable fabric. I'm 5'6 and the dress is a bit short on me, ending about 2"" above my knee. The sleeves billow, just like the picture, but the sleeves are a bit tight around the upper arm. The tie in front only rests at my natural waist if tie VERY LOOSE. When tied tighter, so show more shape, the knot is more like an empire style dress."
3.0,These are very big on my face but they do work as they should.
3.0,"picture shows black background, I'ts almost same color as the moon and can't see the stars. it is still pretty however wanted the moon and stars to show up."
3.0,"Like, runs a little big!"
3.0,I thought this would be maxi length but it was an odd length  Returned
3.0,Cute top but way too big.
3.0,Can‚Äôt give this wallet 5 stars because the Velcro doesn‚Äôt seem strong enough to hold it closed. My son needed a wallet ASAP or I would‚Äôve sent it back.
3.0,It was too small - my fault sorry. I should have gotten an extra large ):
3.0,As many reviews have said these run small so you'll want to keep that in mind when you're picking which one to buy and you'll want to wash them first to see if they shrink or if the ink runs. Loss of two stars because of extra thin material and sizing not as listed. (I ordered a larger size but they still shrunk when washed)  The material isn't going to last through many washes because of the thin cloth and inept stitching.  After a wash the 42 xl in this brand turns into a 32 waist- so if you're a 32 waist you'll probably want to order the xl in this brand or pick another brand entirely that is an actual 32 to begin with and a blend that doesn't shrink in wash.  Yes I measured the waist band.  Hope this helps.
3.0,"I love the dress style, shape, look, and length.<br />Downside is the material is a super cheap feel and look material, i tried it on and its exactly what I wanted, besides the material and because of that, the print is a little off also. Too bad because other than that, I really liked it, but I probably won't wear it :("
3.0,Decent shirt but it was orange and not red as expected by description and it being a Christmas shirt.
3.0,It's good but I'd like one smaller
3.0,"Mostly string, not leather bracelets. Cool looking though."
3.0,The dress don't look like the add very rankle but I keep it any way
3.0,"Not a great variety of letters.  I only received 1- B, 2 - M, 1 - N, 0 - R, 1 - S etc but got 7 of X and 7 of Z, 10 of T.  I would think that I would get more qty of more popular letters."
3.0,I bought this 7 months ago and I've loved it - the hat is cute and the speakers are not too quiet (although I would caution that it can get REALLY loud which isn't great for kids). But recently it seemed to have trouble charging.  tonight i pulled it out to try to charge it. I was pretty gentle but it broke open and the charger input part broke off. So now I just have a hat?
3.0,"I gave it a low rating NOT because it's a bad pant, BUT it's not as pictured. The photo leads one to believe it has a ""ribbed type fitting"". Which in photo appears to be 2 inches or so. That would be the classic design in the old Kung Fu pant with a large 2 or 3 inch ribbed band at the bottom cuff. It is NOT that only a gathering at the bottom. I was deeply disappointed."
3.0,I returned these not because of quality they seemed okay I just didn't really like the fit. They seem to be a little big overall and the fit what is very long in the legs I prefer a shorter inseam they may be right for you they just not right for me
3.0,Well made and a soft feel. Downside it has to be ironed because it wrinkles terribly. Not a good purchase unless you are prepared to iron.
3.0,Nice but too big for my ear...had to return.  Refunded right away.
3.0,One fell apart and I lost the circle emblem. They are ok
3.0,See through! Material felt cheap and itchy.
3.0,"Great socks for soccer, just wish I didn‚Äôt have to buy all four of these when I just needed the pink and black. Now I have two pair that will never get used."
3.0,"These run small. My kid take a medium usually, I had read they run small so I ordered X large."
3.0,"The material on this was cheap, ran a little small, and showed any imperfections in my belly area."
3.0,"Nice concep, HOWEVER, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend washing this item with anything else ! The fleece lining ‚Äúsheds‚Äù and get imbedded in EVERYTHING that III comes into contact with....."
3.0,"These are a bit small - shorter than expected and snug fit but good for sports. Quick drying, Again more like a legging with slight flair rather than a yoga pant."
3.0,The cloth shrinks upon washing otherwise a good product
3.0,It's Costume Jewelry. Cute in it's own way.
3.0,"Small, but there's room for adjustment"
3.0,"The hi-visibility color was the main point of my purchase. They're not the most comfortable gloves, but they offer basic protection and light padding for a moderate biker (10-20 mile rides). If you need more padding/comfort for your palms and wrists, there may be better options out there."
3.0,I was satisfied with this product
3.0,Case was excellent! Delivery was almost a month!
3.0,"Ordered a small, was very large, quality was not as expected, cheap looking and raggedy, returned, the the return went very smoothly, refunded immediately, good customer service!"
3.0,"These are cute, but I was surprised at how thin the material is.  VERY THIN-see through.  Will be fine for Summer. Arrived quickly."
3.0,"Purchased mainly for the length but they don‚Äôt stay up. After a few minutes of walking in them, they bunch around the ankles."
3.0,"Yes, very pretty, but not practical."
3.0,I like it. It‚Äôs lightweight and very cute.
3.0,Size is smaller than what appears to be posted but still a nice product
3.0,"Cute, but overpriced. The design is front only. Will keep, because I collect key pendants and do like it. I expected more. Sellers should consider reducing price."
3.0,Like the fabric but cut cut from shoulder to shoulder along the back is too tight making me feel like it will rep if I reach forward.  Other items I purchase in the same size fit looser.
3.0,"The stone in the middle was not as nice as I thought it would be and the earring doesn't really look like sterling silver, but I am going to wear them anyway."
3.0,"The material for the non mesh pouches feel cheap. The mesh cube bags are fine. For the price I paid for it, it does the job."
3.0,Not water resistant!
3.0,"I bought this for my sister who loves cats. I didn't know the kitten would be as big as it is but I liked it better than a small one. (It shows in the last picture that it was bigger but i didn't look at all of the pictures. So it was not misleading. i would had still bought it) The chain is horrible. Very tarnished. And some of the metal of the chain is broke so theirs sharp pieces that can catch the skin. Overall for the price, it is a great buy for the cat lover you know. My sister liked it ‚ù§"
3.0,It's not quite what I expected. It flares out oddly at the bottom.
3.0,"The seems on the under dress and over dress lace don't match up so it looks like some sort of dart down the side. The lace pulls up while the under dress rolls.<br /><br />This dress fits me nicely, you just can't walk in it as it just shimmies up.<br /><br />I don't know if I should return it or keep it. I work it for two hours and it's just not something I could ever enjoy myself in.<br /><br />It would be great for photos or standing. But, not dancing or walking."
3.0,Some people will love this but I just find it way too hot to wear this style face mask in hot humid Florida. I use it as a pillow cover for a small accent pillow instead. The material is nice and the design is very pretty.
3.0,These leggings are super comfortable but unfortunately they are not squatproof :( . I love working out on them but I have to wear spandex underneath
3.0,"My husband loved the bracelet but after one, yes one day, the screw was stripped. Of course he‚Äôs afraid to wear it out, fearing the screw will fall out and the bracelet will follow."
3.0,Like it but charms fell off after one day
3.0,Love the versatility of it
3.0,NICE. PURCHASED SMALL RETURN GOT THE CORRECT SIZE
3.0,As I stated an a email to the seller the lettering is very light and needs to be darker but its ok but looking for something else
3.0,I love it but had to sew the shoulder part so it would stay down.
3.0,Purchased for my daughter but she is not happy with the fit.  So ends up not using it.
3.0,"I ordered this dress in the sleeveless green color and in the short sleeve pink color. Both are cute and fit as expected, the green was for me, I'm a 32DD, 5'4"", pant size 2, normally wear a small. The pink was for my daughter who is 13, much smaller chest, but half an inch taller than me and a 5 in jeans. My issue is that I bought them both on the same page and yet, they came from different distributors and mine is made better. The pink one is actually a peachy color, pretty, but not pink, and it's VERY sheer. My daughter put it on and there's no way she'll be able to wear or without a slip underneath. Also, the bottom of her dress is not hemmed, it looks like it was just cut and left that way. Mine is hemmed and is not not sheer. If we didn't need them for photos tomorrow, I would return her's and try a different one because even though they are pretty, they are not worth $18 and I didn't get what I ordered, she wanted a baby pink, that's not what she got. This is the type of dress I would buy at Ross for $8."
3.0,Earrings didn't match well and have a bronze cast to the deep gray.
3.0,Warm but they don‚Äôt work with my phone which was the whole reason I bought them.
3.0,The top fit great very comfy.. The leggings ran small!! I had to purchase a separate pair of leggings to go with the shirt.
3.0,Large was tight on me and I'm a size 12
3.0,The stars fall off and my daughter tries to eat them
3.0,"Normally wear a large, so I ordered an extra large. Maybe I should have tried an XXL. Definitely order a size up or two."
3.0,"Order arrived quickly, however the women's t-shirt runs small. The XL is like a medium.  Returned it for a 2 XL.  This was purchased for someone that is 5'5 and weighs 190 lbs."
3.0,very noisy walking on hardwood floors
3.0,"Doesn‚Äôt work as good as I thought it would, for me"
3.0,"I‚Äôm so disappointed! First of all, the color is SO off from what it looks in the picture, these pants are a light grey. The only thing I appreciate about it so far is that the cut seems of quality and good stitching quality. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 about 140lbs, ordered the medium and it fits lose and long. Bummer."
3.0,"Beautiful cotton but the size chart is not accurate for men's sizing in US.  My size 9 feet needed Large, not Medium as suggested."
3.0,"I'm VERY picky about my socks.  I ordered a medium and I wear a women's 7.5 and have a 14.5&#34; calf.  These socks were a bit big in the toe area and the seams were not bulky but with the slightly bigger toe area they felt a bit uncomfortable in my shoes.  I got these socks for running.  The compression in the calf area is amazing though!!  It was snug at the top of the calf but not overly snug, although I only wear them for about an hour or two at a time.  I usually get shin splits while running and these socks definitely help relieve that.<br /><br />If you are looking for a really great compression sock at a great price and you aren't too OCD about your socks then this is the pair for you!!<br /><br />I received the product for free or at a discount in return for my unbiased opinion."
3.0,Size is too off. Thin and see through material
3.0,"It is a little small, but I love the colors.  I were the size that I ordered but it is small.  :("
3.0,"We bought this umbrella for our outdoor patio table.  Unfortunately, it broke the same day we received it.  We had it up at our patio table for lunch on the day we received it.  A slight wind kicked up and the next thing we knew - the umbrella broke.  I immediately took it down and contacted the seller through Amazon.com.  They gave us a full refund and offered to replace the umbrella.  It may have been just one-time experience because the seller seems to be very professional and reliable.  They immediately helped to resolve the situation and did not want us to have a bad opinion.  Perhaps it was a faulty piece on our specific umbrella!"
3.0,The biggest clothes bag has a brojen zipper
3.0,"The shirts pattern is pretty and it fit nicely, but I didn't do my homework as well as I should've because the sleeves are polyester, YUCK!"
3.0,"I thought I was going to love this thing.  I bought it to put in my tote bag that I carry on the bus during my daily commute.  My thinking is that it would organize the heck out of my bag so all the pens, ipod cords, etc.  would be tamed.  But what I found is that it was kind-of annoying.  Maybe it's just me, but I liked just throwing stuff back in my bag instead of trying to tame it all under the stretchy bands every time.  I ended up with all the items thrown in my purse and this organizer in there too, with nothing on it.<br /><br />I have since put this to use in a plastic tote where I store all my extra cords, chargers, etc and I like it better for that use.  I don't get items out very often, so dealing with the organizer isn't a frequent occurrence.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with the quality of this product;  in fact the quality is quite good.  Just be sure you really have the right use in mind."
3.0,"Provides compression but foot part of sock seems to run short.  I have regular width foot, not wide, size 8, 8.5.  Yet the recommended size, Small, seems to run short in the foot part.<br /><br />Pills easily on foot part of sock.<br /><br />Not confident in the sizing."
3.0,I like this sweater and it is comfortable to wear. The only thing is below where u tie it is a little awkward with the extra material that bunches up and it also is long after u tie it and tight. It does not look like how the model is wearing it. Might look better on someone who is taller. Also the color I received is a little more orangy than the picture. Watch the video to see the real color. Didn‚Äôt know that was the same brick red color as this one.
3.0,i only wear the shorts. the shirt is a little small. but the shorts r very comfortable they do roll up a little bit when i walk but that‚Äôs any shorts. they are not sweat proof!
3.0,Sorry but maybe I don't have a need for compression socks but only difference I noticed as I can feel I'm wearing tight or socks I didn't notice any different in circulation or anything like I said it feels like I'm wearing tight socks and that's about it
3.0,It‚Äôs a check valve I never used it
3.0,Short length
3.0,"I really like the style of these jeans,  I bought the pair with the holes in the knees. I only gave it three stars because they‚Äôre a lot darker color in person than they appear on the picture."
3.0,the clasp is difficult to close
3.0,"It's ""ok""  but if I'd known it was so much longer than the picture shows,  I wouldn't have bought it. Other than that it's  just OK"
3.0,I ordered a size way up and it paid off.  It's cute.  It fits.  Whatever you size it add two sizes for a loose comfortable fit.<br /><br />Very lightweight like a tshirt.
3.0,The glasses are OK. They provide the appropriate amount of shade but don't flip up so when you walk into a store or anyplace that is not real bright you have to take them off.
3.0,Print is beautiful. I should've ordered it at least two sizes bigger for it to fit. Normally I wear a large top since I have a large chest but this was too small. Still beautiful top though.
3.0,The lava beads are much larger than I expected. I would have liked smaller beads since my wrist in on the smaller side. The product is good quality. No complaints regarding bracelet construction.
3.0,Chain not long enough
3.0,The bottom fits good I have big hips the top kinda snug my chest is a size 40D but it is a very nice color
3.0,They are okay more like a toy
3.0,I like the flare look but the fit I was not happy with...
3.0,"Leather is really dark brown, nearly black.  Looks brown when out with black and black when put with brown.  Goo leather otherwise. They didn't put in (or they removed for cost) the normal saddle in the part that goes through the leather hole, forcing the leather to bulge out in the buckle."
3.0,"Even though it said crotch loose design, I never expected these pants'inseam would be so low, they look somewhat weird  because of that loose crotch design, like one of those ninja pants that singers wear.<br /><br />The design is not so good, as they are skinny in the end but wide and loose in the crotch area which makes them look very disproportionate."
3.0,"The watch is very cool looking withe the blue face & bezel.  However, it is difficult to read in low light; since the dial isn't backlit, it depends on LEDs at 12 and 6:00 to provide light, which are too dim to make the hands readable."
3.0,"Way too long. It's actually quite unflattering for a short person. Fits great, it's comfortable too, but I'd have to get this tailored."
3.0,"Smaller than expected, had to alter it myself. But otherwise it was perfect"
3.0,Product was slow to arrive. Package blew away down the street too because it was so light. My neighbor found it and brought it to me the next day all soaked from rain.<br /><br />Key ring is good. A bit small compared to others I have and the flat nature of the rings makes keys with small openings harder to thread on the ring.
3.0,"Very pretty dress, however after first wash it really looks like and old dress. The black turned grayish black"
3.0,Dress fits nice and true to size but the material is cheap and hot used for Halloween day of the dead outfit
3.0,"Just ok, soft material, rides up a bit, waistband folds/rolls down at times, when relaxing at home..I'm 5 '11', 190lbs, a 35/36 inch waist and ordered the XL."
3.0,only 2 of the lights worked
3.0,"Way too small and hard to get anything you need once you get it in there. The outside is made well, no complaints, but unless you have very little hands or put hardly anything in it, it won't work well."
3.0,nice support but should have grippers on bottom to prevent sliding
3.0,"They fit well. Material is nice and phone touch works ok. But they're really thin. Warm enough for the drive to work or walking to lunch. But if I'm outside for any length of time of doing any shoveling etc, they're not warm enough."
3.0,"Poorly made, seam that connects short to suit came out after first wash. To bad, it is really cute."
3.0,"Super cute and comfy band for Fitbit, but the first piece of 5 little pieces of velcro that attaches the strap has fallen off. It can still be used but a longer piece of strap now hangs off, which is a little annoying."
3.0,"Very small, very thin, very see through."
3.0,They were a lot smaller than I presumed. Fashionable. I‚Äôd like them a lot more if they were bigger
3.0,"So, pretty."
3.0,I like the color but the pieces aren't simetric range. The shirt is wider and the short runs smaller.  I can't buy a Large because the shirt will be extremely big compared with the short.<br />Maybe this can help someone before buying.
3.0,A little on the larger side.
3.0,Pretty but larger than expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 125lbs and the waist was loose and top gapped.
3.0,So small can barely read the names on it
3.0,"Cute, but could use a pearl in the middle of the bow, otherwise you can't tell it's a Boeing, just looks like two rows of pearls sitting there"
3.0,"I loved the bikini top of this product. Just like the picture and the size fit great. However, the bottoms, though perfectly matching the picture and super cute were far too small. I ordered a medium and it squeezed and gave me a huge wedgie. I normally wear smalls in bottoms and 2 in pants."
3.0,"I expected this to be a little larger than it was, but I like the quality."
3.0,"Pros: It allowed me into buildings which required masks. P-100 filters will fit into them.<br /><br />Cons: Even though the description states for ""teens and women"", it was WAY too large for me. It hung down past my chin, and there was a lot of airflow around the cheeks.  When I tried to tighten it up, it just made my ears hurt and pretty badly.  P-100 filters fit into them, but the quality of the filter pocket was ""off"". It was bulky, and the filter would not slide in properly, kind of like an unmade bed. The filter does not really cover the nose and mouth (which is the important part), but I think that the reason the filter does not cover nose and mouth is that the mask is too large so it just sort of ""dangles"" off your face."
3.0,Average visor. Cute patterns for summer. Ordered in April arrived in June from China
3.0,"This one is going back. It runs very small, has no stretch, and even the black dress is translucent.  The eyelets have a liner, but it is mesh, so I dont feel comfortable wearing this at my church to sing in the choir.<br /><br />Otherwise, it seems well-made and attractive."
3.0,"After a long time in Amazon, I chose this one. The quality is average, not particularly good, but I think the style is good."
3.0,Beautiful waist but NOT hemmed at all
3.0,"I ordered my regular size or maybe I sized down. I‚Äôm not sure if I did or didn‚Äôt, but I can fit them. They are tight on my feet though and I have wide feet so I don‚Äôt know how to get used to that. They are too cute to not have. I‚Äôm going to freeze them and then see if they are a little more comfy. The girls on tiktok say put a freezer bag with water in the boot and freeze it. That should break the boot in and it works on dr.Martens so this should work.<br /><br />I will be updating my review after I freeze them."
3.0,"I went back to the product description to see if I missed the way the collar of this jacket is made. It‚Äôs just not easy to see. In one of the photos the model‚Äôs long hair is covering the collar. This weird collar is the kind I hate. If you‚Äôre ok with this collar, you might like this hoodie. Just note, it runs way big. The one I am wearing in these pictures is a small. There is no extra small available, so what is that model wearing? It‚Äôs not terrible if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for (the one in my pictures, not in the product description, because those look very different)."
3.0,I was so looking forward to getting this. I'm a large bus after reading reviews it said to go a size larger so I got an XL. It is way too small and fits my 100 lb daughter who wears small sizes. Not sure who these were made to fit but it is not sized right. Anyway if you are a small person order three times a bigger size.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
3.0,Wish the chain was longer and stronger.
3.0,"They do break sometimes, but most of the time they're easy to put back together. For the price, it's worth it."
3.0,Watch band closure was scratched right out of the package.
3.0,"I ordered a size much bigger than what I normally wear, and it still fits a little to tight. :( although I really enjoy the color!  Once placed with an open long cardigan it looks nice. :)"
3.0,I think the dress is super cute just not on me :(
3.0,Good for a cheap spare pair.  The dark lenses are awesome!!
3.0,"The ""V"" is not as deep as it looks. I'm 160 pounds, athletic build. 30 waist at 5""10. The v is much shallower than pictured. I wanted it specifically to wear my necklaces to be seen. These won't show them. A small would never fit and a large would be too loose If you don't mind that, then it's a good shirt."
3.0,"Thin fabric, small size"
3.0,Okay I guess! Not the best product. Eye size is a definite mismatch. But for the price it‚Äôs okay if you can make it work.
3.0,"Not the best fit or quality, but cute message!"
3.0,One shoe was a bit smaller than the other.
3.0,Purchased my normal size and it was a bit small for my taste.  Sending back but will repurchase in a bigger size as the material is a nice quality.  I like that the skirt is longer in the back for a little extra coverage.
3.0,Cute! But fit is narrow!
3.0,I have pretty thin legs and found these not so great. I am 5'7 and 120 Pounds. They just would not stay up as pictured. I use them as below the knee socks when I wear combat boots now. I just hid the extra fabric in the boot.
3.0,It will not fit on my wrist no matter how hard I try to slip it on but it works fine as a keychain piece otherwise.
3.0,The purse itself seems well made and it is nice but the strap does not fit over the shoulder. They are not long enough. I am considering returning it. Shipping was slow as well. I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review.
3.0,"uh u get what u pay for i guess, the flower looks like a cheap plastic kids toy. the ring is honestly cool until u see the flower lmao. the flower ruined it and made it ugly asf i dont recommend personally"
3.0,They are a little short. I am 5'7&#34; and if I wear a flat shoe it's ok
3.0,It's a really nice band but not for small wrists like mine. It's too big for me as of now but I'm going to see what happens once I break it in a little bit.
3.0,Nice looking mag. Clasp but too small it is uncomfortable to wear I do not have a lg wrist but a med. one very disappointed in that department snap button I thought would match not silver w/ a rose gold bracelet
3.0,"I'm 5'11"" 160 ish#s. Got a large. Fit for me is a little above the ankle. There's just no fit over the chest; and I have almost no bust..... there's a snap that would hold it closed but it's located too high, and still puckers open below it..... I couldn't figure out what to wear under it.... maybe a navy blue camisol... but like several other dresses, I'll probably turn it into a skirt. Then I can wear heels and have that loose really long boho look. Really wrinkly. Needs ironing."
3.0,Super cute but not comfortable at all
3.0,I usually wear a 2x/3x. I ordered a 5x to be extra comfy and it is too small.
3.0,"The outfit is cute don‚Äôt get me wrong but the material is on the cheaper side & the sizing is completely off. I ordered a medium fits more like xl, I‚Äôm returning this item because I don‚Äôt like the fit on me. I‚Äôm usually a M-L but I feel like if I ordered the small it still wouldn‚Äôt fit. Definitely not for skinny or slim thick women."
3.0,They are very mice looking
3.0,"This hat is actually super cute but it's tight on my head. Hey, maybe I have a fat head. I'm not sure but it doesn't look or feel quite right.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. But I do not give stars to products that are undeserving. I always try out and use each item personally. Then, I always tell it like it is. In other words, getting a product at a reduced rate does NOT have any type of influence on how I rate a product."
3.0,"The colors of this suit are very dull.  Also, the  fit was way too large.  Ended up returning it."
3.0,"If you are a size 14+ (Or if you have a little bit of a belly) then this dress/tunic is not for you. It is made well, but it is somewhat small."
3.0,Too small. Gave them away
3.0,"The metal part does not stay right side up. It's also really bendable. The bracelet broke like a month in. By broke, I mean the knots system stopped working. Only one side worked.. it was really annoying. The aluminum plate also breaks really easily. When it was too annoying to wear (because of the knots) i just took the metal plating off and bended it and it broke. Not really a problem if you don't step on it by accident. Overall, the knot work need major work. You can probably create a better system to make the knots run more smoother."
3.0,"Good for the price<br />Cute too, not to strong"
3.0,"I have worn Warner bras for years but when i tried on the bra, which i ordered in my normal size, the cups were too small. You need to order 1 cup size larger. The return process was no issue whatsoever."
3.0,its a really nice color<br />but its a little low cut for me<br />but regardless its nice
3.0,"The size of this bag is perfect. The fabric isn't sturdy enough, it's very floppy. I want to keep my wallet in the outer pocket with the magnetic ""snaps"", but the snaps don't hold and there goes my wallet sliding into the floorboard. I'm pretty bummed about this. I haven't found a suitably sized replacement yet."
3.0,Didn't wear it.  It was too small and the merchant was ethical and accepted the return.
3.0,"Nice quality but be careful, it runs a little small or the wrist."
3.0,"I give it a three because the fit is awkard, no shape at all but material was pretty good. It smelled awful but overall if you are looking for something to lounge in, beach wear and go, this is perfect."
3.0,The glasses themselves are fine as far as style and quality for $12.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br /><br />They TOTALLY TOTALLY wash out red/orange/yellow colors. Why is this important? Stoplights and brake lights do NOT stand out while l wearing these -&#62; it does not matter how attentive you are as a driver if you can't see red. Do NOT wear these while driving.
3.0,"Beautiful pair of shorts, just wish they fit! I‚Äôll lose some weight and hopefully I can wear them!"
3.0,Pretty but poor quality and tangles way too easily
3.0,"The width was fine, but the length was very short. I'm only 5'4&#34; and the Medium was still way too short on me."
3.0,Seemed to shrink more than usual.
3.0,No snaps at the bottom for easy access during diaper changes!!!
3.0,"First of all, an important note that i didn't see anywhere else. I can't replace the lenses as there seems to be no way to get them out without bending the frame. So for those of you looking at these for two different colored lenses hoping to do the work yourself, I'd say look elsewhere. Also, the metal used for the frame and screws is not magnetic, which makes it difficult to put the screws back in the frame.<br /><br />However, if you just want a cheap pair of tinted glasses you can throw away once they break, they're good enough. But for the lack of repairability, I can only give it 3 stars."
3.0,They're not kidding about a high waist. Really important if you're more than an A cup. Also the shirt fabric is extremely light compared to the top. Odd combo
3.0,Christmas gift...not what I expected the hat part is weird......but I guess it will have to work.....
3.0,The fabric wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. It was white on the inside (showed at the neckline) and felt like the color was painted on.
3.0,"I like the look and feel of these, but unfortunately they bled color on to my pillows."
3.0,"cute, simple dress! LOVE the green color."
3.0,"Very nice shirts in appearance, but not in sizing.  I normally wear a large.  I had to exchange both for two sizes up to XXLarge.  5 stars for looks,  but only 3 for sizing."
3.0,beautiful jewelry but the ball comes unscrewed to easy
3.0,Liked a lot just too small
3.0,Bigger than what I thought.  Will be great for Halloween and Mardi Gras.
3.0,I loved everything about these pants I got them in white. My only problem with them is that they were too long for me. I don‚Äôt know if they send me the wrong inseam I ordered the 30 inseam but I might have just received a regular large because even with heels they were too long see I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and I haven‚Äôt found a pair that I liked in petite and I took a risk but unfortunately the length was to long
3.0,"Comfortable and lightweight, made out foam"
3.0,"It has a ""Movado"" look to it, and it does look classy, but it's a cheap watch., So the strap is primitive, there is no second hand, the crown wobbles. it is weak, scratches very easily.<br />You do get what you pay for. Now, that doesn't mean you have to buy a $2,000 watch, but honestly, anything below $60 is not going to last long or look great."
3.0,Too pink and the band is too loose on my arm.
3.0,"Beautiful print, but I should have checked the measurements before buying. It was definitely not large enough for my curls and coils. I would purchase again if I found it bigger."
3.0,"Cute charm, cheap chain"
3.0,"This dress is really cute, but runs small and the material is clingy. I am normally a M/L but based on previous reviews I ordered an XL and it fit nicely. However, it was not flattering around the midsection. I  recommend a slip or spanx."
3.0,Fabric quality is not that great
3.0,The quality isn't that great.
3.0,"First of all, the garment is well made and of nice fabric. I bought it in purple just because it is unusual for a plaid and I love it. I ordered a Small, I am 5'-4"" and weigh 120 so after reading the reviews I thought it would be adequate. BUT, after washing it, the sleeves shrunk to about 3"" above my wrists. I would recommend ordering up. It probably will be huge but you can always take up the hem if you want it shorter."
3.0,This wasn't as gorgeous as I expected. It was very long and very hot. I will be returning.
3.0,"These run very small and sadly I can not wear them.  I normally wear around a medium, but these run smaller than I like and are not comfortable.  I would recommend sizing up and these would be much better."
3.0,I expected it to be a little roomier. I wear large as a size. It also would be nice if it had a tie on the inside to keep it from gaping open.
3.0,"These hats are really cute; however, the detachable chin straps are a little *too* easy to take off and kept falling off on their own. I like that they're adjustable and offer good coverage for sun protection. Also great that they're machine washable. My one year old wore at the beach and when it got just a little wet it lost it's shape very easily which caused it to droop in the front and cover his eyes, which was quite frustrating for us both. If you don't plan on getting wet, though, it should work just fine. I have some other brands with a sturdier bill that keep their shape when wet that work better for the water."
3.0,"I like the material, it came very wrinkled and lots of thread coming off of the seams. It may look better after washing? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 140# and the Medium was too large on me, definitely need a small if not XS depending on if it shrinks. Will send back and maybe not try another one because it was so wrinkled and I fear it will remain super wrinkled."
3.0,"Ok, run big in size.  A little more masculine looking than I expected."
3.0,"Could of been a size down, made with a little bit more heftier material.  Made well with strong stitching."
3.0,Good quality.  Thin yet warm. Really comfortable.
3.0,Ordered Large. I‚Äôm 5.10 185lbs give or take. It felt somewhat large. I would have preferred a tighter fit. Good product if this is what your into.
3.0,Beautiful leggings just cut to the smaller size.
3.0,Not a good quality one. I didn‚Äôt return it just because I would have to pay shipping
3.0,Very cute but thin material. I returned.
3.0,"The inserts were a joke, and Chinese must have high breast."
3.0,"Very nice looking shoe. But puma has a lot of work to do. I don't know if it's just the stock insole. But this shoe is very flat footed. Also, the size ran pretty large. I guess that it could've been acceptable if the insole was something special. That'd probably not make the shoe feel so large to fit. Also. Even though it looks nice. The tread and the sole are very basic. Like they took one of their cheaper tennis shoes. Made it a size too big and threw a safety toe in."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3dc8c5cce1324cbaffabc890465b7819]] I dislike that they show them with a cute box on the page. And they got here in a plain clear plastic bag with the barcode. Like really? It was a gift and i could have paid the same price for more socks but i thought they would come in the cute little box üôÑ i didn‚Äôt like that.
3.0,Expecting new size any day now
3.0,"It looks like a huge bag once on, especially when looking from the side, it's large at the tummy and I could wear it perfectly if I were pregnant.  Fit great at the chest, shoulders and breasts but large at the tummy. There is room for 2 at the tummy."
3.0,I‚Äôm a medium but ordered a large and it fit very well. But the blue suit turned out to be a dark purple...
3.0,"The longer, narrow pair of earrings is very nice. Kind of bo-ho looking and also look handmade. The second pair, the round earrings, just aren't made right to fit and hang (at least not in my ears) without making my earlobes sore. Still, the 2 pairs are a bargain for the price, and the one pair is worth the money."
3.0,"Got a small and was real loose at the top.  Washed in hot water and they shrunk enough to not be so baggy.  Still saggy on the front.  Will be wearing leggings underneath, belt and long shirt."
3.0,"I needed them because I get mails a x-rays, but haven't 10 ear piercings and hate to remove them. So these were great except for kind of flimsy. I have had other plastic jewelry that held up well. These not so much but I do have to be honest they did the trick and if one falls out there's plenty more. Just wish the hoops were more fir"
3.0,"The ones I ordered were the &#34;Butterfly&#34; version; the &#34;Rose&#34; has far less embroidery.  Without the embroidery, and with a smoother elastic on the waist and legs, these might have earned that fifth star.  The fit in back is a bit cheeky, and the waistband rides high enough that they can peek over the top of most of the jeans and shorts sold in the past 10 years.  (But at last waistbands that are AT THE WAIST are coming back, hurray!)  As it is, you'll want to wash them before the first wearing.  When I saw how much of the tear-off embroidery backing was still present on the inner surface, I looked at the fabric content and ignored the laundry instructions completely.  I just tossed them into the next load - washed on the permanent press cycle in Warm wash water with Cold rinse, and tossed into the dryer on Medium.  The colors of the little ribbon bows on the front faded a bit in the wash, but otherwise they came out just fine - and the excess embroidery backing had removed itself in the process.  (Yes, I'm casual about washing stuff.  If it's too fragile to get the normal treatment, it's probably too fragile for this household.  I feel like I'm better finding that out right away than when something that was a critical necessity got oopsed.)  While the colors in the package were indeed all from the ones shown, it would have been nicer if they weren't a random pick from what's shown.<br /><br />Because of the elastics chosen, and the embroidery, these might not be the best choice to wear under lightweight leggings, but they should be smooth enough with most anything else."
3.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful nose stud, and fits me very well. It‚Äôs too bad that I have an allergic reaction while wearing it. My face peels and becomes very rough all around the area of the piercing."
3.0,"Not enough compartments, but small ad light like I wanted."
3.0,Very cute outfit but the fabric quality is not great (thin) and the pants are not sewn very well either.
3.0,"Very cute, but tore up my feet. I have small feet and I found these run very narrow and tore up my feet."
3.0,"The bottoms are really cute! I sized up (based on reviews). I'm 5'1&#34;, 120#, 34C. It fit as expected but the cuts were weird and off, it didn't fit right. Like the cuts were loop-sided in the top. The material was nice which was a bummer."
3.0,It's ok. The dress looks a bit plain and not as dressy in real. I had o do some minor adjustments to get a snug fit. The sleeve pucker when pulled off the shoulder like in the picture so I couldn't wear it like that. It's made to fit on the shoulder to get that smoothe fit.
3.0,Thin materiel
3.0,"I'm giving it away, I ordered an xl and it was form fitting"
3.0,Print is a little faded but nice fit
3.0,I was a bit disappointed when I realized that these were not progressive lenses.  I got them because I thought I could look through clear at the top and corrective at the bottom.  Be careful when looking at many types to check for this if you want progressive lenses.
3.0,"Fragile frame, they are good to keep in your car, not for every day though"
3.0,Run smaller than size.
3.0,I ordered a small and it was way too small. I then ordered a medium because i thought it was super cute and a large for my daughter. The large fits me and I‚Äôm a size 2!! Don‚Äôt order if you have a large chest either.
3.0,Order down 2 sizes
3.0,"Very cute and durable, straps are to short for a heavy person."
3.0,"Too long, needed to fold up cuffs, keep falling down. Large in waist snug in thighs."
3.0,"It's cute, though it does run a bit small.<br /><br />The seller sucks though. Hardcore."
3.0,"Good fit, but a bit thinner/cheap material than I expected."
3.0,"I like it, but it has small scratch on front side."
3.0,The cut answer style is perfect. The fabric is odd though. It is a polyester and spandex blend which reminds me of swim suit material. Also it is rather see through so finding the right under garments or a slip is a must.
3.0,"If you are an adult, these will be sized small. I got an XXL, which should have been an adult M/L, and there is no way these will ever fit my daughter, who wears an adult M-L in most clothing. She couldn‚Äôt even get them up her leg. These are really sized for children only. But if you‚Äôre getting these for a child, these are very nice dance tights. Just didn‚Äôt fit my particular child.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

3.0,Lasted 3 months
3.0,They are cute but hard to breathe through and too hot to wear at least in Texas. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend
3.0,The bottoms are a great color and fit but the waist comes all the way up to just under my breast! I wore a tankini top and you couldn‚Äôt tell but it‚Äôs pretty funny looking without a long top!
3.0,"I really do like these and wear them often. I bought multiple pairs, (pink, purple, light grey, black and charcoal grey) sadly I only wear two pairs, ( black and grey) because for some reason the others constantly fall down, it‚Äôs uncomfortable and annoying, I can not put anything at all in the pockets either because it weighs it down to much. It‚Äôs not like they are a size to big but maybe made of a different fabric that doesn‚Äôt hold. But the black and grey I can even carry my phone in (which is the main reason I bought these for) and they stay on comfortably.... unfortunately, it was a huge waste of money on the other pairs that I don‚Äôt even want to wear because I constantly have to adjust them and I can‚Äôt even put anything in the pockets..."
3.0,It‚Äôs good for a gag gift. Was disappointed in the quality
3.0,"It looks and works great, I've been using it for a month now and my only issue is that it appears the carbon fiber is starting to show some scratches or paint damages. I tend to keep it on my front pocket by itself, so I don't really know whats causing this damage.<br /><br />The elastic band is still as tight as day one, so I don't fear it will stretch out and stop working."
3.0,Tight in the top. Not meant for bustier women. I suggest going up a size larger than your normal size. Other than that it's a nice dress.
3.0,The padding is way to bulky for a size medium.  The elastic around the cuff (not the compression pant) is too tight.
3.0,Is broken<br />Bad product
3.0,"They were nice, but arrived broken. I was able to fix it, but it was still a hassle"
3.0,"While they are beautiful, I would have preferred a bit more bend to them, my ears are to small and I cant bend the ring tight enough to keep them on."
3.0,Far too shiny for me so I sent them back - quality was good otherwise.
3.0,It's really beautiful but only for decoration... because as soon as you are wearing it the letters will disappear....
3.0,"While it does what it's designed to do, I found that it's not as easy to use as a regular guitar style strap. Due to it's design, it leaves an instrument (for me its my ukulele) hanging around your neck at an odd angle. The main problem is that many ukulele and mandolin manufacturers don't build in ""end block"" into their instruments so that normal strap pegs can't be used. This strap is probably the next best solution."
3.0,One leg is longer than the other which makes me look really stupid when I wear them to work. It's like a 4 inch difference when the short leg rides up. You get what you pay for I guess!
3.0,Cute but of course like most of those inexpensive costumes looked cheap.but ok for one day I guess. I returned mine bcs the head piece came broken but re purchased same one at a local store as I didnt want to wait and get it late.
3.0,"Item shipped great and looks beautiful. There are even tiny sparkles in the design that you can't really see in the picture. Got this for my mom, she's gonna love it!<br /><br />Edit*  4 months in and the clasp is not holding. Mom had to buy another one. üòî"
3.0,"Comfortable, but after the first wash a lot of stray strings started showing up."
3.0,"These are really nice gloves but for some reason, they run really big.  I got the same pair in another color for my 3 year old and the 3-4 size fits him great, but the 4-7 size of these was HUGE on my 5.5 yr old.  She does have small hands but the excess in the fingertips is a little ridiculous. We will keep them since they're only for playing in the snow but definitely consider sizing down on these."
3.0,They are cute but run slightly small.
3.0,"for the amount of money you pay, the quality of this product isn't the best. the earrings are flimsy and bent a little bit. other than that, the color of them is what i wanted, black and white."
3.0,Size chart wasn't correct... Runs very small
3.0,"I love the style of this shirt, but it's not as flowy as it appears in the photos. It's definitely more fitting to the body, and it runs a bit small."
3.0,These pants are like the windbreakers of the 80s/90s but not in a good way. They are very loud and just not the nicest feeling material. Definitely not my favorite pants for my husband. The fit was okay.
3.0,"I am 5'1 140lbs currently and 34D. My size is a junior 9 in pants (at 26 years old, I still buy junior sizes for pants, I hate the cut of most women pants), or 6/8 in womens depending on the cut. For dresses, I am 8 or 10 depending on the cut (normally its the breasts that move me to a 10 for some dresses). I am used to<br />I can get it on, need help with the back of course. However, for the waist area, I feel like i need an XL.<br /><br />The neck strap for the halter needs a way to adjust it. I need take out more than an inch of the leather fabric for it to actually fit. I bought this for use in a renfest costume but could be used for steampunk. I want awesome cleavage, not some leather hanging off me not touching the girls even a tiny bit.<br />I have to find a way to get the neck adjusted"
3.0,"This dress fits great and loved the material, however the bees look like flies... That's my only complaint."
3.0,"These gloves look cool. They are a space print and look like the picture. I was very happy that the ""small"" size was a women's small and not a men's small. Overall, the gloves are good and do what you expect them to do for the price. They are durable,  the fingertips work for the cell phone and they are warm. However,  I used them to go snowboarding and they did get wet at the fingertips after use of falling in the snow a few times. I noticed that my fingers felt cold and took them off. I noticed on the inside, the seams had come apart at the fingertips and the snow-wetness was seeping in slowly. I actually let them dry overnight and they were still wet at the fingertips.  I turned them inside out and let them dry that way for a few hours and they were dry after that. Good gloves, cool print and they do the job, definitely not water-resistant on the inside though, should you actually get them wet at the fingertips but I do believe they are water-resistant in the rain."
3.0,"This shirt runs small, order up."
3.0,I love this hat and was super excited to gift it to my MIL for Christmas but when it arrived I was very disappointed in its quality. The bill is very thin and the areas that are 'worn' show the foam underneath and makes it look very cheap. I still gave it to her but didn't like feeling like our gift was cheap.
3.0,"bracelet was everything I hoped for and more. 1 small problem ,this anklet us very small as far as length.  Most women wear a 9inch anklet and it has hang room. This just barely worked for me and I've worn a standard 9in anklet for the past 20 years never once had a problem . I was lucky to get this fastened with not even 1 mm to spare. No hang room so I may have to return im not sure. I'm worried if I gain even 2 lbs it may not fit? But if size isn't an issue buy this 100% its really special !"
3.0,Runs extremely small. They would fit a woman's size 8.5 comfortably and that's it.
3.0,Must return because of the fabric. Not as casual as I expected. Otherwise great product just not what I was expecting.
3.0,Lil snug but super cute
3.0,"It looked exactly as pictured... from the front. The back was as expected but the armpit holes are made to look like someone cut the sleeves off of a t-shirt, so they're big enough to expose your bra and some of your ribcage. I was surprised since this wasn't in the photos, but I think it looks cute when I wear it with a sports bra. The fabric is soft and a surprisingly a great quality, too, for the price. I'm just docking down the stars because they failed to show exactly how it looks from the sides, which could understandably lead some buyers to be miffed."
3.0,"The is some Large to me, but it feels great."
3.0,Dress was fashionable and made well.  The fabric was wrinkled from shipping and deep creases did not press out.
3.0,These work fairly well. We work at food pantry but put tubber gloves over them as they do not fit very tight.  They do protect your hands & nails when working with produce.
3.0,Beautiful earrings. Cannot figure out how to put on. Any instructions would be appreciated
3.0,To thin not very warm
3.0,Fits perfectly on top but down in the legs it‚Äôs wide.
3.0,It is a slippery boot. Made of hard plastic. No bottom grip at all. Not comfortable. The ankle support was way to wide. Maybe to tuck pants in.
3.0,"Material wrinkles badly... nice push up on the bra- but if you were big busted, boobs would not fit in this."
3.0,the big toe was a little snug but the grips onthe bottom helped a lot in piloxing
3.0,Not well made beads fell off not long after we purchased it
3.0,Looks nice but the comfort is questionable. I got foot pain after a slight use of few minutes. I was so excited to use them and so badly wished them to be comfortable. They are not so comfortable at they seem.
3.0,"A little big, but very comfortable"
3.0,material slighty cheap
3.0,Good bag but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs leather at all.
3.0,"I really like the top on this. It fits nice, looks great on, and does not have a padded bra insert. I dislike padded bra inserts, so this is a plus. The bottoms, however, feel gathered even though they look like boy shorts. As a result they feel weird on and they have the feel of riding down in the middle on me. The top is 5 stars and the bottoms are 2 stars."
3.0,Flattering style. Uncomfortable fabric.
3.0,It was better than expected considering the price. I would order from the vendor again.
3.0,They don't really sit flush against the ear.
3.0,"First things first, this is NOT a faux wrap dress - this is a dress with a &#34;belt&#34;. To me, a faux wrap dress would give the illusion of a layered skirt...just like all of my other actual faux wrap dresses I have at home.<br /><br />I ordered the navy/white leafy pattern. Its gorgeous. I love the color and the print. The navy is like a slate-blue that would work in any season.<br /><br />I am 5'4&#34;, 170 lbs, and 36D-ish chest. I can usually wear size 12/larges. This dress in size Large was  too tight on my stomach - which is a total &#34;me&#34; problem but I didn't feel comfortable with how snug it was on me. I feel like if this really was a faux wrap style, the extra layering on the skirt would help hide these flaws.<br /><br />It is also extremely low cut which may be okay if I didn't plan to wear this for work. I may work on myself and my health a little and come back to this dress (i returned it for now) but if I do, I will still have to do something about the top fit like maybe have a seamstress pull it together for me?"
3.0,"If you are very short waisted, this would probably fit well on you. The largest size (Asian sizing) should have fit according to their sizing chart, but probably not if you have a normal size figure. I normally wear a 10-12 depending on how it's cut. It's really cute, though. I'm bummed it didn't fit. Back it went...."
3.0,It‚Äôs cute didn‚Äôt turn my neck green the one time I wore it. If you only plan on wearing it a few times it‚Äôs probably perfect has a nice length. Obviously not the best quality but I mean it wasn‚Äôt expensive so serves its purpose.
3.0,"Super cute & comfy! Unfortunately, after wearing it 3 times .. there are small holes and the seams are coming undone. It had a weird &#34;fading&#34; on the front when I unpackaged it, but it seems to have dissipated after washing. I managed to snag it on sale, so Id still say that despite these &#34;issues&#34; its still worth it. I wear a 16/18 and ordered an XL and it fits so nicely! I'm 5'2&#34; and it falls mid-calf - which is perfect with some comfy leggings and boots!"
3.0,"The grey shirt is the only one that‚Äôs not super thick from the print. These shirts, even though shirt sleeved are heavy and hot ü•µ. Not worth the price. The prints are pretty but can‚Äôt be worn during Florida‚Äôs spring/summer. Bummer."
3.0,"I would have given this review 5 stars if not for the placement of the pin causing gravity to keep it  ‚Äúupside down‚Äù.  I had to cut a piece of gasket to add enough friction to keep it upright.  We‚Äôll see if that is enough.  Might need some double-sided tape to stabilize upright.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a shame, because otherwise it is a very nicely-made pin."
3.0,Runs smaller the waist tie goes into the pants the first time I tried them on Fished it back out thank goodness  the string is definitely to short I wear a size 18_20 and I got a 3x and it's still small so beware but are comfy haven't washed yet  hopefully they will still fit.
3.0,Fits awkward. Too hippy dippy for me.
3.0,"The shorts are a good quality, but are more of a normal fit."
3.0,"Once I got these I was so excited.  When I opened the box, one was broken. In the process of returning.  Too bad. Very pretty."
3.0,It‚Äôs ok- colors are not as picture shows/ it‚Äôs more lavender than grey- runs small
3.0,"Bust was fine, but middle(tummy) area too tight for my liking.  I prefer a looser fit."
3.0,"these have a super cute design, but the thumb holes are painfully small. one quick try on and I knew I had to return them. could be adorable for a kid tho! not for grown up size hands."
3.0,"This is a decent quality replacement wallet insert though not exactly what I wanted.  It has 5 pockets rather than the 6 many other makers provide, the tab for inserting and holding this in your wallet is a bit flimsy - my previous insert had a stiff and heavy insert which is better, and while I do like the extra large pockets in this one the are a bit too big to fit neatly in my wallet and stand out beyond the leather of my wallet."
3.0,Nice shirt but it‚Äôs oversized. The XL is more like a XXL
3.0,pros: it's made of good materials.<br />cons: it's kind of small and I wear regular size hats. it seems irregular. It looks and feels used.
3.0,These are cute and seem to be of good quality but my 4 year old won't wear them.  He's had the plastic ones and we all know how uncomfortable wire glasses are compared to plastic ones...  I just thought he would like them to go with his police uniform costume which he wears frequently but no...  they are cute and seem to be well made though!  Just not so comfortable and he won't wear them.
3.0,"The cut was not as described, I went up a full size and it was still to tight in the chest and shoulders although I ordered based off their size chart. The color and fabric was nice but I'm very disappointed. It is not cut a line and lose fit at the base but more tube/tunic cut"
3.0,"The hat is cute.  It looks just like the picture.  It just is--SMALL.  It doesn't stretch over my 7 3/8 head and doesn't cover my ears, so it's not too warm and also looks idiotic.  If your skull is very small and so are your brains, this is a safe bet."
3.0,"I adored this dress from the moment I saw it but I'm giving it three stars because I was only able to wear it three times before the zipper broke catastrophically to wear I couldn't fix it myself. I love the dress enough to take it to have it repaired, but I am extremely disappointed this happened. This dress had already become my favorite dress but the quality has certainly left me feeling frustrated.<br /><br />I love the way it flatters my figure. I'm 5'5 and I weigh about 170. Sometimes it can be difficult to find something that works with what I've got, lol! The fabric of the skirt is very thick and heavy, which is great for when it's colder outside. I purchased red wedges to wear with this dress, but I've also worn brown tights and brown boots with it - it looks so cute either way. Very versatile.<br /><br />From the first time I put it on, the zipper was VERY difficult to get zipped beyond the part where the top of the skirt met the fabric of the top. No, it wasn't that I'm too fat for it - the zipper just would hardly budge beyond that point. However, I loved the dress so much that I dealt with the tedious coaxing to get it to zip. This morning, while trying to get it zipped, it broke entirely. I examined it closer to find that there were fibers caught in the zipper right where I'd always had such trouble getting it zipped. I tried getting the fibers out, and the zipper became detached from the dress entirely. Imagine my heartbreak.<br /><br />So, my point is, the dress is beautiful. It's worth the price... if you're willing to accept that you might have to pay more money down the road to have it repaired. I think it's one of those &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; situations. For me, I love this dress, so I'm taking it to my trusted seamstress to have the zipper fixed.<br /><br />I can't give it 5 stars, due to the zipper issues, but if we're basing this on looks alone, I would. Hope this helps someone!"
3.0,I like the design and color but it‚Äôs too big
3.0,"Not as roomy as thought.  Have to use a small wallet. If you put to many things in purse it gets bulky. It looks good, just needs to be bigger."
3.0,Did not fit as expected. Coloring was off and they run small
3.0,"This band was a fine addition to the leather band that came with my Moto 360.  The tools included were a nice touch but mostly ineffective in getting the original band removed.  Fortunately, I had already purchased a much nicer tool for @$7.  Once I finally learned to get the pins installed (I'm not a jeweler), I gave a good tug on both ends of the band and they felt secure.  I wore the watch several times without incident.  I can't seem to find a way to remove one link that I think will give me a snugger fit on my wrist but it is otherwise very attractive and comfortable.<br /><br />My problem is the band suddenly just dropped off my wrist!!!!  Lucky for me I was just pumping gas and the watch landed on the band itself when it hit the concrete so no damage to the watch.  What was worrying is only 15 minutes earlier I was riding my motorcycle on the freeway.  Had the same thing happened then, the watch would have been history!!<br /><br />I do not know how the watch came apart, the link that fits to the watch (that holds the pin) did not show any damage and when I got home I was able to install a new pin into the watch.  I will keep an eye on this band and not expose my watch to any potential situations I could loose the watch (like wearing it while riding) until I have some confidence this won't happen again."
3.0,"very small, but very cute."
3.0,Not at all the colors but too cheap to return. Disappointed not the right colors.
3.0,Only problem I had was tightening.
3.0,Love the earrings but didn‚Äôt like that it didn‚Äôt come with the backing. The rubber backing that goes onto a earring so they don‚Äôt fall off easily
3.0,did not fit me correctly
3.0,This was a gift and she loved it. I only wish it didn't take so long to get to me.
3.0,"I like how the ends attach snuggly on the bows, however the cord could be a couple of inches longer. We hen I take the glasses off my face it hangs slightly lower than my neck which is annoying. I see no reason for the plastic attachment for adjusting the length when the cord is already too short. No worth sending back, but not happy."
3.0,more of a neon color than the regular yellow posted.
3.0,Looks and feels great! You will have to cut the eyeholes yourself if you plan on wearing it full face though
3.0,For me to small
3.0,Looked kind of cheap when we got them so they look much better on the net then when they  come
3.0,"It's a pretty kimono. Frail construction, though. I would have thought that for the money that this robe would be a bit sturdier. We shall see if it survives the first hand washing, or if it disintegrates."
3.0,My husband got very good use of the ice packs but found it too much to put them in the pouch of the undies. He also found briefs better than boxer briefs.
3.0,"I wear really high heels, but these feel as though you tipping over."
3.0,"Returned it, length was too short"
3.0,So cute the colors are amazing. my only concern is that they shed ALOT... I have a lot of leg warmers especially furry ones and these are the only ones  that shed. but love the colors!!
3.0,"the sleeves are too tight for this size range in plus size and the body  a bit tighter than their other pieces in this group. Got the 'snake' skin. I fits only because it is very stretchy, but it fits tight. Since their stuff usually fits I had already removed tags. I will be more careful next time."
3.0,I very much like my bracelets.  I will make one comment about a problem with them.  Without both ends being connected the loose end catches on clothing and also gets caught into the rings of the charms.  If you were to fix that I would certainly be back for others.
3.0,The color is completely different than pictured. It shows a cool gold when I got a rose gold orange thing. Very disappointing.
3.0,The size is good. The quality of material looks a little bit cheap. But it is appropriate to the price.
3.0,"Too small, disappointing"
3.0,I bought a medium but it was too big. I am 5&#34;3 like 145 lbs and dose G cup bra size it fit at the top but was big on the bsvk snd stomach areas.
3.0,The awkward fit and tiny pockets make for a relatively unremarkable wear.
3.0,"Esta bonita, por el precio Esta bien"
3.0,Fits small so size 1-2 sizes up!
3.0,"I purchased this specifically for the design on the mask. On the website, you could clearly see the design, and I really liked it. When I opened my mask today, I was very disappointed because the side that has the  red portion of the design is so dark that you cannot see the design. The mask literally looks like it has half a lion's face on it and the other side is almost black. You can't even see the Horde symbol on the other side.<br /><br />The mask is also HUGE. It can cover my entire face, including my eyes.<br /><br />I'm really sad because I was really looking forward to wearing this."
3.0,"This is a large band, not for smaller wrists.  It broke after using it for 6 months."
3.0,I like it but it's bigger than I expected
3.0,Recommended 100%
3.0,Somewhat larger than expected. Didn't need the touch screen.
3.0,"I bought the 6-12 month size for my average-sized 8 month old (16 lb, 27 inches) for Christmas pictures.  Even two months later, it's still way too big to even think about having her wear.  It's a cute style and would look great with the plain black onesie I bought to go with it, but definitely size down if you purchase!"
3.0,Very pretty. But heavy.
3.0,"Very thin material, very sexy, fits small. I ordered a size up and still doesn't close. I've made the best of it and it's still sexy on even if it barely covers my boobs."
3.0,Didn't realize that it wasn't water proof but mechanically sound.and nice finishing
3.0,"I am somewhat disappointed with this bag, as the pictures of the product are very appealing. I ordered a black bag and the color looks more like a dark brown, charcoal, or even a deep navy, rather than black. Also, I feel that the pictures of the product make it appear nicer, with better trim, than it actually is. Most of the pictures are of the khaki style and perhaps that is a nicer bag. On the plus side, the bag is roomy, the strap is adjustable and the canvas material makes it light. There are also a number of pockets with storage room. It is a reasonable price for what you get. The positives and negatives balance out for me. I am not sure that I would purchase it again."
3.0,Not as heavyweight as I thought it would be.
3.0,A great value.
3.0,"I had to get this to be a groomsman in an old friend's wedding.  It's not the worst time I've ever worn.  It served it's purpose.  Not sure I'll ever wear it again, but maybe.  It's really heavy material.  Forget about doing any exotic knots unless you've got more skill than I.  Not that I have a very much.  Failed to get it into an acceptable Trinity Knot.  A knot I'm fairly comfortable constructing."
3.0,Nice size....durable.....dark in color not vibrant
3.0,It looks really good love it. The only thing I didn't like was the band. It is plastic and a day with the watch on made me hand red. The plastic band kept rubbing against my skin .
3.0,I‚Äôm 5ft 6in and it is longer than all of my maxi dresses and skirts but it‚Äôs too silky to roll the waistband up so i haven‚Äôt been able to wear it comfortably
3.0,These worked just fine but 1 of the earrings was on the wire backwards so I had to remove it and fix it myself.
3.0,Not meant for bigger girls. I'm fit but 6' and it doesn't go around me...
3.0,"Soft and well made. However, Returned, way too short in torso, girls not women's sizing."
3.0,No mater what bra I wear with this my chest is on the verge of slipping out. Wonderful dress thin material. Works a great witba petticoat though.
3.0,"This dress arrived timely & was adorable, but was too small.  I ordered an XXL & I would say it was more of a L.  I wanted to wear it, but since it was too small I had to send it back."
3.0,I had to cut part of socks @ the ankles because my husbands ankles are swollen. So far we like them. He definitely cannot wear the socks with his shoes on.
3.0,"The bracelet is hard to read and ‚Äúbelieved‚Äù is broken into two words ‚Äúbe lieved‚Äù, and the second half runs into the word ‚Äúshe‚Äù. Coupled with the font, this makes the bracelet difficult to read, or at least requires the wearer to tell what it says. Who wants to go around doing that?! I loved the design of the bracelet, but the message is what ruined it for me and will have to find another elsewhere,"
3.0,"I love the style of the glasses, however, the sturdiness of the glasses are horrible.  I had to rebuy the glasses 3 times.  The right arm of the glasses broke in the same area each time.  Lasting, about 3 to 4 months.  I will not be buying anymore glasses from Amazon."
3.0,I love this dress.  Just add some assecories and it was fabulous
3.0,The top is cute but dies not fit like the photo.  It is not that long and the string is all that keeps the blouse on your body!  I hope it doesn't unravel!
3.0,"It fit nicely (tight). I'm 5'7"", 150 lbs but for some reason I didn't like how it looked on me.  Easy return.  This is why I buy everything from Amazon!!"
3.0,"Great item, fast service, prompt delivery, all around great experience!!!"
3.0,"Nice to have, but cannot read the words because they are not in English."
3.0,"These are a tight fit even for a 5‚Äô8 140 lb teen. Somewhat uncomfortable at first, needs broken in like shoes.  Extra padding is nice when sliding across the floor for volleyball."
3.0,"The design is super cute, but it's small and the material has no give.  The buttons are pretty iffy on quality - I'm not super confident they will hold up and the front pockets are fake.  I might take a gamble to size up but I might just return it and let it go."
3.0,"I like very much how soft these  are and they aren't overly hot like many yoga pants.  They have pretty much zero tummy control if you're looking for that.  Love the pockets.  The pockets and legs do get baggy fairly quickly, I had to keep pulling them up after a full day of wear.  Overall a good value for the price."
3.0,"Pretty, just a bit heavy on the wrist."
3.0,"Ran very small. If you wear an XL because you're tall, it might work. If you wear an XL because you need a bit of belly clearance, this is not for you. I returned them."
3.0,Too small...I guess it's time for me to hit the gym again? No idea..
3.0,Looks just like the picture. The fabric isnt at all soft or comfortable. Personally I think it looks too much like a dressing robe on me so I doubt I will ever wear it. I think I would be uncomfortable if i did
3.0,I like the buckle... easy to use.. but does not stay tight.  Pops loose constantly.... bummer
3.0,It was too big for my wife's wrist
3.0,"I was looking for a sweatshirt, this is not a sweatshirt.  It‚Äôs very soft and silky but not warm at all. Although it‚Äôs very pretty."
3.0,"I have double wide feet so they are a  bit small but usable. Sole is decent, but over all the sandal is just OK. I ordered more than one model and find this alternative to be excellent:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002KKCZS8 B002KKCZS8]]"
3.0,They are cute but the image is a litte misleading. The beads end shorter than the spiral in actuality and I thought these were studded earrings. The sales picture looks smaller than they actually are
3.0,"I found this coat to be rather bulky and heavy, literally! I think it weighs 5 or 6 lbs alone! The material is very warm and the waffle weave texture reminds me of my grandma's rug. If you like vintage style, it fits that. Even the buttons remind men of 1970s drawer pulls. However, for me, it was too warm. I live in a warm climate that rarely goes below 50. This coat is more suited to temps in the 30s. The coat is very roomy so has room for sweater layers underneath. I think with a sweater, I could wear this in 20 degrees! It definitely has room for layers and scarves to bundle up! My biggest issue with this coat  though was the hood. It is ridiculously large! Like I could fit two of my head inside of it. It completely engulfed my head. I don't need the purpose for that. It came halfway over my face so with the hood up, I couldnt see."
3.0,Bulkier than expected. Too short on my long torso.
3.0,beautiful patterns but the material would make me sweat.  Had to return both sadly.
3.0,Ordered for granddaugher. Too fragile.
3.0,"This coat is pretty nice, it‚Äôs a sturdy fabric and a handsome color, but it‚Äôs smaller than I would like. If this coat were a blazer I‚Äôd say it fit perfectly, but it‚Äôs a raincoat and I want to wear it with a sweater or a sport coat underneath. I find the armhole a little too high and the back between the shoulders a bit too shallow for my taste. If you want a long coat to wear over a tee or a button up and you like a slim fit, you‚Äôll probably like this a lot."
3.0,"Based on the reviews I was expecting them not to be cotton, and indeed they are tagged as polyester.  I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôd make out of this material normally‚Ä¶ heavy canvass tents?  It feels like that felt-like layer on the bottom of some plastic tablecloths.<br />Nonetheless they look pretty close to the picture in person.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6.5‚Äù tall, 150 pounds and wear a 34D bra.  42‚Äù-34‚Äù-40‚Äù.  The size 12 fits me nicely.<br />I‚Äôm going to keep them.  I think the weight will be nice for winter weather."
3.0,They are very cute. Just as pictured. My only issue is that my ears are not stretchy enough to compensate for the flare. I wear other double flared jewelry just fine but these still don't fit.
3.0,"I thought this was cuter in the pictures than in person. It's not terrible quality really, I was just not crazy about it so returned it. It did fit as described, and it was soft."
3.0,"Wish the arm holes were not as large, must wear a tank top under it so bra does not show."
3.0,"In the pictures and the video for the product, they looked like they had a loose fit but was a bit to clingy for the size. Will return, and maybe try the next size up."
3.0,"The dress has a strong smell out of the bag, it fades after a few days. It fits true to size. The quality is fair, some of the stitching isn‚Äôt uniform."
3.0,Fits every where but in the top
3.0,Material is thinner than I would of liked...
3.0,Its beautiful but runs too small. I got a medium and it fit my tiny teen daughter. I am a medium but i couldnt fit into it. so if your a medium do a large.
3.0,"These make your butt look great, but the are not squat proof. These are great if your just walking around, but can be a little see through in the sunlight, which is a shame because they look so nice. They are super high waisted."
3.0,"Decent price for this storage bag.  Zippers are cheap, one bag is already broken. Don't really need it.  Overall, ok for price if just going to use to keep bike covered and use handles to carry."
3.0,My feet are still cold in these boots. Idk if it because I have too many layers on but my toes always feel cold in the boots.
3.0,I should of purchased a size bigger but it is soft and what I expected.
3.0,"They are cute and soft. Are true to size. However the shoulders keep sliding off, meaning they are cut too big."
3.0,"6/22/2011 - This watch is great, in regards to the previous reviews, I've had nothing come lose and it has never gave me the wrong time after I set the time when I received it. This watch looks incredible. My only problem with it is that when the second-hand ticks it is loud, especially if you are at work and in a quiet room and the only noise is coming from your watch, a little uncomfortable. Also, I can hear it when I'm trying to go to bed. The sound drowns out easily, but just if it is silent then the ticking is noticeable. Overall, this is a great watch and great price. I give it a 4/5.<br /><br />6/24/2011 - Now having the watch for a few more days, I'd like to offer some more information. Another thing that I noticed is that the functionality of the watch is not as good as I first thought. In order to get the right day (Mon, Tues, Wed, etc.) You have to manually twist the dial to move the hands to set the days. I got the watch on a Wednesday, but the date was set for Thursday; so I had to fast-forward the time for the week. After the date was on Sunday, it made a mysterious jump completely missing the designated Monday slot. ((2 twists per hour x 24 hrs) x 7 days) + misc. ""jump"" = 300+ turns just to set the flipping day!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks Great!<br />- Affordable<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Abnormally-loud ticking<br />- Setting the watch is a hassel<br /><br />I give it a 3/5 now."
3.0,Los esperaba un poco m√°s gruesos
3.0,"I am a small top girl and this was still too oversized for me. It does bug me that the top, that is buttoned, always flaps over and doesn‚Äôt stay flat. Just a quirk, but it was very pretty."
3.0,Waist was too small even though I ordered larger.
3.0,This hat just didn't look good on my head no matter how hard I tried to make it work. The brim was rolled up and it want baggy in a good way. I talky wanted to like it but ended up returning it.
3.0,"These are adorable wellies and my daughter loves them! However, I was disappointed when one of the handles popped off after simply trying them on. She still wears them, but it takes her a little longer to get that one wellie on than it should."
3.0,"It's an ok dress. The color is pretty and the fabric is soft. But I wanted it very loose and super flowy to the tops of my feet. I listened to the reviews and just went up to an XL. Should've gone with the largest size. Because of the way it's cut, if you have a round butt (bubble out), it'll flow on the sides but ride up at the hem and stop at that awkward length above the ankle. Then when you add a belt (necessary) it'll stop at mid-calf.  It's awkward looking. I don't really care for it. I wear this dress around the house now instead of out as I intended. I'm 5'5"" tall."
3.0,This item fit a little too large and was too long for my liking. I returned the it as it wasn‚Äôt my style.
3.0,Ran a little small. The calf is extremely small
3.0,These fit my son fine. He just wasn't too thrilled about the cut out on his upper thigh. Neither was I.
3.0,"The primary description says medium fits up to 5'8"", which should have fit me fine.  However, I should have read further down where it says M = 5'6"" so I ended up with a pair that sits ~2"" above my ankles.  I guess they're ok for a back up but can't really wear for regular training."
3.0,"This is a medium quality bracelet, not branded. The inter-links are simulated, not independent.If you mind the cost, it is fine, if you would like something of better manufacture, steer clear."
3.0,"I wanted the shirt with Max on it for my son's birthday, But instead I got one with Max and Duke and a saying &#34;every dog has his day&#34; I wanted the other not this but since it was last minute I just used it anyway. Oh well."
3.0,"Not really much to say.  I like loose clothing.  Sadly, this fits.  I will donate rather than return."
3.0,Fit very small contrary to size chart..
3.0,"I didn't expect something of super high quality as the price was low, but they are too small for most people."
3.0,Cute blouse.  Ordered extra large but it was really too small.  Had to return.  No problem returning item.
3.0,It‚Äôs pretty but it runs small. Order two sizes up! I‚Äôm usually a medium. Ordered a large and it is very tight around the booty.
3.0,The dress is super cute the only downside is that it fits pretty boxy to your body.
3.0,"It is a skinny tie, and the material is pretty course. It looks cheap, but then again, it is.<br />I will still wear it on a casual occasion."
3.0,"Looks AWESOME, no doubt. But it really is too narrow to fit comfortably on the face, so I see why everyone is saying it's too small. For reference, I am a SMALL person--five foot two and generally just kind of the size of a child. Usually when I read amazon reviews that say something is too small, I'm like: perfect! That'll fit!<br /><br />But no. This is actually just small for an adult size head and face. It is also a very heavy, seemingly sturdy resin, which is great except there's zero possibility of stretching this material out, and if you dropped it, I'm pretty sure it would break. If I had the time, I'd make a mold and recast this in a lighter and more pliable material.<br /><br />Again, though: looks awesome. Love the CONCEPT of a mask to wear over the functional face mask for a pandemic friendly costume. Less useful, though, if the heavy and narrow thing doesn't stay on your face.<br /><br />The ties are puzzling. I think if I replace them with something stretchy, the weight of the mask might feel more evenly distributed. I'll report back with pics if I figure it out. As is, given the weight and the narrow fit (or lack of fit), it feels cumbersome and unstable."
3.0,"HEadline kind of says it all.  Great design and excellent quality.  However, the clip is so tight you can not slip bills in and out.  If you carry more than 5 bills or so at a time it is almost impossible to get them in. So you are in the position of fanning and folding your money and wrestling with the clip in front of the world."
3.0,Not glass. Top just sits on the platform . Mirror on one side
3.0,"Shirt looked great but their sizing is off... by a long shot. I ordered this shirt as a Christmas present for a buddy of mine and his normal shirt size was medium. When the shirt came and he tried it on, it fit like a large. So it was returned and I replaced it with a small. When that shirt came and he tried it on.. that one fit like an extra small.<br /><br />So I think their measuring method could be off?<br /><br />The graphics on the shirt were absolutely amazing though! I definitely wish the shirt fit my friend!<br /><br />I‚Äôm unfortunately no help on sizing though."
3.0,I wanted something cute and roomy to wear home from the hospital after I had my twins! Fits as expected and has help up nice in washer/dryer! The positioning of ‚Äúmama‚Äù is a little off but for $10 I think it's a nice crew!
3.0,The toe ‚Äòholes‚Äô where backwards. I made sure they were on the L/R foot but the big toe hole was the smallest and vice versa.
3.0,Next time make one that is all solid red instead of one with what looks like a dragons eye near the center of the amulet.
3.0,"These are very pretty, but ripped the first time I tried them on. They run very small!"
3.0,"Fits well and cute but there‚Äôs a button by the neck to fasten. Once fastened, how is an 8 year old supposed to get out of it to use the bathroom?!?! Not made with children in mind!!!"
3.0,Not what i was expecting.. Poor quality
3.0,"I would have given a higher rating for customer service if they had a category for that. The 3 star is because they sent the wrong size. I think that even if it had been the ordered size, it would not have fit, this bra had no cups.  I am a full figured woman with the added indignant problems of aging, southward trending larger breasts. So if you're one of those lucky individuals that would fit, at the most, a B cup, it would likely work for you. When brought to their attention, they were prompt and pleasant about refunding me."
3.0,I am a jewelry designer and I use Swarovski crystals. that dark green is probably called Scarabaeus green. the true green is the Emerald.
3.0,"The back has too much fabric hanging, but the material and color are nice."
3.0,"Although these are cheap and cute, they are flat, and it causes a strange glare off your cheeks on the inside of the glasses. It‚Äôs makes it kind of difficult to see. They‚Äôll be alright as pool junkers, but I couldn‚Äôt wear them very often."
3.0,"Can't complain because of the cheap price.  It's definitely made on a budget, the zipper doesn't glide too well and it is not perfectly shaped. By that I mean there are little bumps where it should fit smoothly.  It is made in China so be aware you will not be able to return it no what they say in the write-up.  However if you want a fairly good looking cheap sweater at a very cheap price, this is the one."
3.0,The foot trend design on the sandal want as comfortable as expected
3.0,Unfortunately the glasses adjust but we're not able to help my cause. So I am waiting on the mailing label from company.
3.0,"It's a bit smaller than I had hoped for, but looks just like the posting."
3.0,"Head opening is WAY too big....outside appearance is good,but don't plan on moving your head,not even an inch"
3.0,"The product was awesome. Exactly what I needed for my costume. The only problem was they were very bent due to poor packaging. So if you buy these, you run the risk of them possibly being broken upon arrival."
3.0,"Es bueno pero la talla, es un poco grande."
3.0,"It ªs a perfectly gorgeous sweater and I love it so much, but I ªm returning it.  Unfortunately for me it clings to me in all the wrong places and makes me look four sizes bigger than I am.  I ªm usually a medium, ordered a large, and it wasn ªt large enough."
3.0,"I am an adult lady and I had purchased other models in this line that fit perfectly and were all the same size.  I knew that this style differs from the others, but I could not understand from the catalog the measures.  I took a chance.  Arrived perfectly packaged.  Fit and finish are excellent; however, it is tiny compared to the other models.  Really a child's size.  Wish the catalog compared all the models by dimensions to avoid this mistake."
3.0,"This was cute and exactly what I was looking for, but it did seem to run a bit small. The fabric is soft which I love."
3.0,Beautiful design and color
3.0,Not misrepresented...but really thin and unimpressive. More like a good banner than a thin scarf.
3.0,Nice shorts but run way smaller than I thought. I am 5ft 4inches 150lbs. Got XL but too snug for me.
3.0,"This item is super cute to look at online. However, when I received it, the fabric of the sleeves are different from the rest of the dress with a finish that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the dress look complete. Perfect for a good church dress or professional setting/ event. But I‚Äôd suggest taking a look at the fabric that is mentioned prior to purchasing just to make sure that‚Äôs exactly what you want! Lastly, the seller did an excellent job of shipping the item out super fast! I was impressed by their professionalism!"
3.0,Earning are way too big
3.0,They are not as striking as the picture. But they are cute. I bought them for a wedding but they are not dressy enough
3.0,If you are looking for the same fitting as the picture you definitely need to order the largest size! The bottom comes together pretty tight. The black part is a cotton but the &#34;plaid&#34; is almost like a costume material like polyester. A little tacky looking. I'm using for a gym shirt so it's fine for that but I wouldnt wear it out.
3.0,"The material seems fine right out of the package. Has not been worn or washed yet so I will update. IT IS NOT BLACK&#62; it is a midnight blue but clashes with my black dress which it was supposed to match. The colors are muted in the picture compared to what you will receive. It is a rather &#34;loud&#34; dress.  But still pretty.  According to the chart, I ordered a 10  to meet my daughter's length requirements and it was still not as long as pictured. despite measuring her height for a good fit.  I would suggest going a size up."
3.0,The dangly things fell off and most of the stones.  I don't mind though.
3.0,"I picked the color pink, and it's completely see through. The quality of the garment is medium to low. The fit is ok, maybe a darker color would be a better choice. I feel like it would be good for a beach cover up. I got it for a vacation as a day outfit.. not the kind street-walking wear I was hoping for."
3.0,The one issue I have is that I ordered black straps and I was sent the sandals with white straps.<br />The sandals are very comfortable and fit well
3.0,"Ordered a large men size, received I think its a lady small size. Good looking shirt but unable to use it."
3.0,Fit is weird. The toe and heel cup is too big and loose. They don‚Äôt stay all the way up if you do a lot of walking.
3.0,"I bought this in my usual size, the straps actually line up with my bra straps which is awesome, that doesnt often happen and I dont have much of an issue with the front opening especially after tightening the straps, it goes to my knees but after 2 half days of use and i havent washed it yet theres already piling in the inside which is going to be abrasive after time. I probably wont buy again, I shouldn't have to use a fabric shaver on a brand new product"
3.0,"It's been a very long time since I've worn anything other than boxers soI think these are going to take some time to get adjusted to. I'm pretty sure that they're the correct size, but when I put them on, I feel like they need to be bigger. A LOT bigger."
3.0,Cute dress but after two washes in cold water on gentle cycle the material is already wearing thin and losing its shape.
3.0,"Lo encuentro la tela caliente, pero bien corte"
3.0,"Cute but not for big girls. Bought an extra large for my gf and it barely fit her. She's 5,6 and about 175."
3.0,"All of the reviews said to size 2 sizes down - I found the white to be a little too tight in the stomach area/see through in the large (normally XXL). I ordered the dark gray in an XL and hopefully it will be more flattering. The arm holes were not as large as in the photo, and at 5'6 the dressed skimmed the floor - both good things."
3.0,"On the positive side, I did like the color and the fit was fine. I bought this to wear over my bathing suit to the pool and it's ok, but not particularly flattering. I am short (5' tall), and the dress comes down a couple of inches past my knees which is too long for me but might be perfect for someone several inches taller. The material is silky and very stretchy -- good because it doesn't wrinkle, but it also doesn't have much shape. I thought I'd wear this to run quick errands or to the grocery store, but it feels too much like a nightgown, so I'm not really comfortable with wearing it in public.  I kept it because I'm at the pool almost every day and need several cover-ups, but I would not purchase this style and fabric again."
3.0,I really liked the color but the material was cheap and the fit was off
3.0,They were too small for my 5 year old and the thread on the seam of the gloves started to come unraveled after a few weeks.
3.0,they're a little too tight for my 15 month old. Difficult to get on
3.0,Was as expected for the price.
3.0,"These skirts are just okay. Thin material, but comfortable"
3.0,Problem with thin elastic straps. Disappointed. Nice dress would better stay in place with firm straps.
3.0,Rolls down very easily. I only needed it for pictures so it served its purpose. But it defintly isn't the best.
3.0,This cami fit was not the same as the other one I purchased (bright bandana). The material is not as thick and it was loose in the waist; therefore I returned it.
3.0,"I was pleased with the quality of this belt, but be very careful what size you order. Mine was labeled as what I ordered, but it is easily two inches shorter than it should be. I compared it to another belt I have of that size, and it's confirmed - what I received is definitely two inches shorter than it should be. This is very disappointing."
3.0,It's somewhat shorter and is a flimsy material..will try another
3.0,I like the material it's very nice and soft for the summer ‚úÖ
3.0,"Out of the bag, I LOVED this top, looked great with a pencil skirt and blazer or just casual with some jeans. I got lots of compliments on it. However, I've only worn it twice, haven't even washed it, and I'm noticing some fading on the blue. I'm scared to wash it. I loved the material, it was soft and flattering, pattern was cute, but if it's started to fade now, what will it look like in a couple months? I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. Still might recommend if for a certain occasion or non-frequent wear."
3.0,"Not the best quality material, but my expectations were low. Fits well and washes just fine."
3.0,"I ordered XL, which is the size I always fit, and this item seems to just run small & seem easily shrink able & like they‚Äôll be tight the second time I try to wear them :("
3.0,Got this as a replacement work dress. It was way too tight at my curves and rode up throughout the day because it was a bit too short for me. Definitely too casual for a business look as well.
3.0,The color is beautiful and is what I was looking for. The purse itself howevere smells funny and seems really flimsy. Will update after I have used it
3.0,Like. Headbands for adults not little babies.
3.0,These are super soft and cute but I would order up a size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù fluctuation of weight between 130‚Äì135 and I got a medium. They are so tight.
3.0,BAND LOOKS SILLY ON WATCH
3.0,Nothing special. Basic oversized summer dress.
3.0,"Great socks, but I still get blisters. Maybe without them I would have more than the five I got yesterday on Portland to Coast."
3.0,"Not exactly what I was expecting but still a great product. When it claimed to be an elastic belt, I assumed the actual belt portion was elastic.  Not the case.  Only the loop that holds the excess part of the belt is elastic.  Had they been more accurate in their description I might not have purchased this belt.  But it is actually comfortable.  I will be keeping it even though it‚Äôs not what I was expecting.  I would have given it atleast four stars for the comfort alone had it been what I was expecting.  But the misrepresentation of the belt material required a lower star rating."
3.0,Now has a run straight up the buttocks area. Also..a bit &#34;too defining&#34;.
3.0,"Was a lot smaller than a 3X, I ordered a larger size hoping it would be big, but while it fits, it is a lot smaller than I wanted."
3.0,Overpriced.  The clasp did not work on one so I had to bend it and now it gets stuck.  Not worth the price
3.0,"Very nice looking but are easy to snap,one snapped while putting it in so we didn‚Äôt do the top of the shoe"
3.0,"I like the style and fit but, if you are looking for something to wear outside in the winter look again.<br />I tried wearing this when the temperature was a little under 50, not a good choice.<br />It really didn't keep me warm, but for you it might."
3.0,Poorly sewn<br /><br />Stitches so close to edgings they became frayed during wear
3.0,Looks shorter in photo
3.0,If your hippy then buy a size up.<br />Would be a great bathing suit cover up
3.0,would have worked if they were longer I was using them to wrap around my rollerblades ankle.
3.0,This is smaller than the size on the tag
3.0,"I am 5,3‚Äù, 127lbs 34A. I bought this for a vacation I am set to go on. Great color and the fabric is nice. The only extreme down side of it is the poor cut and sewing job. There were pockets of excess fabric hanging from the sides, which I‚Äôm noticing is the norm based off others photos. I had to go in and sew what I could to make it decent, but still a huge flap of gaping fabric in the back though. Not sure how I‚Äôm gonna fix that."
3.0,"I was expecting more compression to the arch of my foot, but it seems to be mostly tight around my ankle. Which feels weird when you first put it on, but then you adjust to it. Decent socks, but not really what I was expecting or looking for."
3.0,"My stepdaughters loved it and the packaging is cute, but one of the end balls fell off the same day she wore it. I‚Äôm going to try to superglue it back together. Luckily her sister‚Äôs wrist is too small to miss it yet lol"
3.0,Really wide in the hips!! Unless you have major curves it isn‚Äôt flattering. Just looks over sized and awkward. I had to take in the side and sew a straight line instead of the wide cute it had.
3.0,"The band is as advertised. The bracket that connects to the actual Fitbit is a bit weak. I was honestly scared it wasn't gonna stay but a week later it's holding strong and I wear it all day and to work. I work with my hands I am a shoe sales man and have to still my hands in and out of shoes often. It's never gonna caught or ripped off. So so far so good.<br />Color is true to photo, I got pink."
3.0,Very difficullt The installation
3.0,High waisted
3.0,the hats are very nice ..I bought 2 ..but why so tight and small looking üò≥ .. I purchased these for my almost 6 years old granddaughter but will it fit??  she has alot of hair üò≥.. I don't want her to be dissapointed..üôè
3.0,Great arm cover. Order size large than your regular.
3.0,Does not fit well over the nose
3.0,"These pants are perfect, I like the fabric, a large is a large, and I even like the faux control top.  (doesn't really do anything but won't roll).  There is a small hole in the pants where the crouch is.  I paid for perfect pants, I didn't get them.  Amazon should do better I have had so many returns lately"
3.0,This isn‚Äôt your typical knit/sweatshirt material. It also runs small. I purchased and XL to be oversized and it fits like a bigger medium.
3.0,"The size runs small. Usually I wear a XL or 2XL, so this should run really large, but it actually fit snug.  Other than the sizing the vest is a good value.  The quality seems okay, and the pattern is really nice."
3.0,"I am 5'5"" 130lb and I bought a medium. It didn't fit me terribly but not great either. Cheaper almost see through material. No real flair to the bottom 1/2 of the dress, it fit more straight. And the top was just a little to baggy for me and there is no way to pull it tighter. Possibly could have still made it work but returned it."
3.0,"The product is a fairly soft blend that is ""cotton like"" to the touch... seems to be a nice weight to be appropriate for the summer months but is quite clingy.<br />I ordered the xxl ( i am 5'6"" and 200 lbs, normally a size 16 or 18. Unfortunately this didnt work very well with my 4 months postpartum body and was not the least flattering.<br />This dress just did not work for me personally but given the price, color selection, and prime shipping i would still recommend you trty this. Once again i wiah to reiterate that while the dress and fit did not work for me personally, i can see how this dress has decent reviews due to its versatility."
3.0,"Just ok... not as cute as I expected. Also, bought this for breastfeeding but the buttons aren‚Äôt real buttons, just decorative."
3.0,IT NICE
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt stretchy. The lace rips easily. The ruffles are bigger than shown in the pic. I did get a lot of compliments though.
3.0,"when I ordered this item it stated there were only two left and hurry before they sell out.  well when I received this item it was not the brand name Misakia instead it was Hotouch?  I was disappointed in the quality which stated polyester and spandex and was hoping to have a product that is great for travel with little to no ironing required.  this product is a knit jersey cotton feel. the top fits a little snug, clingy. this item was more expensive than the other items ordered yet the quality was not. cotton knit feel not what expected."
3.0,Top is way to small but bottom fits perfect
3.0,Had to rerun cause there was a hole in the dress :(
3.0,"Great glasses. She loves them. Only one problem.... It's missing a screw on plastic piece on one side. Doesn't detract from the wear-ability, but id really like to get the item whole, no matter the cost..."
3.0,"If you don't look too closely, it's pretty.  The large pink flower is too heavily coated with whatever they painted it, so the details of the petals look mushed.  But it looks like it won't take too much to see it begin to chip away, lol.  Then I would probably lightly paint it with something like nail polish, so the details would be more distinct.  I'm just wondering how many wears before it turns my finger green!!!  Hey, for 3 bucks enjoy and then toss!!!!!"
3.0,Not very durable handle broke after using it only twice
3.0,quality seems high but the sizes were a bit wonky
3.0,"I should have ordered true to my size rather than sizing up like a lot of people said. I thought the material felt a little thick and scratchy. Don't like the material used for the lace up front and it came with a chemical odor. It does look cute on and fits good, much better quality than something I'd find at Forever 21."
3.0,mines got a hole in them after the third time of wearing they are really light thin and cool though.
3.0,"I was shocked when I opened the package and felt how light and cheap this lok was.  I have another one that is heavy, sturdy with a heavy metal  bar for inserting into the d ring of a helmet. ???? The bar that came with this lock feels like plastic and can be bent by a small girls strength. Has the quality of this product really gone down that much since I purchased my last one???  But on a positive note it does work, but for $30 - it should be $9.99."
3.0,"The product was NOT true to size. I wear a size 14 skirt but when this arrived and I sized it,It seem toooooo small and very tight."
3.0,"Cool piece but it was way too large for an average female sized ear, we tried in several different people and couldn‚Äôt make it stay on. I would imagine it would fit a mans ear better."
3.0,"The straps were way too long on both the 18 month and the 4T that I bought for my girlsalong with a little bit too wide. Easy fix though, just fixed the straps myself, making them cross in the back to help with the being too wide."
3.0,"Like these pants except the rise is very low and the waist band not tight enough.  These pants would benefit from a draw string.  It was impossible to tell which was the front and which was the back (no label), therefore I assume the rise is identical for front and back, which makes any child with a round behind (such as my child), struggle with keeping them up as they play.<br /><br />The fabric and purpose is satisfactory--tight, warm--it is the waist band and rise issues that I'm not happy about.<br /><br />I should mention the fit is really tight in the legs so I would recommend this for a slim child.  My child LOVES the pants except for having to pull them up constantly."
3.0,Too small; put warning upfront near size selection.
3.0,18kg overlay but still turned my ankle green
3.0,Fit larger than I expected.
3.0,"The top is short. It doesn't come to my hips like on the model. But if you're short, it would be fine. Also, the fabric is pretty thin."
3.0,"Bought a pair of these sunglasses and they were spring-arm ones. Got another pair, which I am writing this review for.... no spring-arms. Not happy with that. They are the same sunglasses though. I‚Äôm just not happy that they weren‚Äôt exactly the same, like I expected from hitting ‚Äúbuy it again.‚Äù"
3.0,"really thin, fits like an XL"
3.0,"The material is very thin, shows every flaw,will be buying spanks"
3.0,Still love the shirt but color fades immediately after one washing and shirt begins to pill.
3.0,"I got this for my son who is still in high school because hoods of no kind are allowed.  This jacket has a zippered hood that allows you to remove it.  I thought it would be beneficial for him to remove the hood during the school week and replace it during the weekend.  The jacket was made fine.  A bit thin. Unfortunately my son does not like the ""shiny"" material it is made with.  He says it is too shiny and makes too much noise when you wear it."
3.0,"The lettering was to high up, wish it would of been more in the middle. Overall love the shirt!"
3.0,These are okay - I bought the large which is for my size foot but they seem too small because the pads on the ball of my foot don't stay where they are supposed to and the top strap is a little too tight. I can wear then for the entirety of dance class without really being uncomfortable though it is ice to take them off - if that makes sense. The top strap leaves a mark and the one that goes between my toes is a little too snug and starts to irritate a bit by the time class is over. Other than that they pretty much do the job and I have worn them quite a few times they seem to be holding up okay.
3.0,I like this bra. Comfy and cute. Meant more for just wearing under a cute top than actual working out. I'm a 34C and petite and got a medium and fits well. Straps are a little longer than I'd like.
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt large enough for 42DDD it was sticky and worked but needed more coverage. Also what do you stick it to once you‚Äôre finished wearing it?
3.0,"EDIT: Below is my original review. I‚Äôve come back after some time of using these and given 3 stars instead of 1, because the seller reached out and sent me a new set of packing cubes. The newer cubes were of noticeably higher quality and I was very pleased. Unfortunately, the toiletry bag still ripped at the seam after a few uses, making the top pocket unusable. I would definitely recommend these if all you‚Äôre looking for is the packing cubes, i‚Äôd look elsewhere for a toiletry bag.<br /><br />Original Review: Cute, but I only used them once and the toiletry bag already tore at the seam. If you‚Äôre looking for quality this probably isn‚Äôt the product for you."
3.0,"Don't suggest Zipper High in the back, making it hard to unzip for the rest room.  ZIPPER SHOULD BE ON THE SIDE MAYBE??"
3.0,"Arrived 5 days later than it was supposed to.  I ordered the light blue & it‚Äôs a similar shade but it‚Äôs very acid washed, which I didn‚Äôt get from the picture.  I usually wear a size large in dresses.  I ordered a medium & it‚Äôs huge!  Couple inches past my knees as well.  As other reviews mentioned-  it is very thick and heavy.  Not a summer dress. It is cute though.  Just not what I was expecting."
3.0,My phone doesn't fit in it as i thought it would. Bit it will work for my daughter.
3.0,"Is very square. Doesnt necessarily look like the  picture, but is comfy and I will still be wearing to the beach."
3.0,"Looks nice for those who want clear beads. Very well put together. Nice style. I've added pictures for anyone who needs them. Mine doesn't show the cool lines and natural flaws in each piece like the picture. They are all the exact same perfectly clear bead (to the eye... I don't have a magnifier).  I was hoping for what was in the picture. I accidental bought 2 and was returning one, but might return both as it's not what I expected. Or maybe save them for a birthday/holiday. Hmmm...."
3.0,These are just what I needed and almost were good quality but 2 of them had a sharp piece sticking up from the part that goes inside my lip. Which unfortunately I discovered the hard way when it cut my lip üò£
3.0,Great fit but if you have a long torso it‚Äôs just too short
3.0,It looks so much smaller in person. Thought it would be longer.
3.0,"Likes- the overall design is fun, complementary, 90s inspiresd, the prints are really unquie, cotton breathable<br />Dislikes- the dress would be great lined, the collar is super thick compared to the rest and flops<br />4/10"
3.0,"The photo makes them look like they wear loose and flowy. While they are loose they are more rigid than expected and are for some reason unflattering, especially compared to how they are portrayed in the picture. I‚Äôll try to post a picture soon."
3.0,They are very cheap looking and really big but they are ok for wat I paid for them
3.0,"I don't know why they always have extra lose area in the corner of the front, and its doesn't come perfectly circled."
3.0,"Loose fitting shift dress. Fits well, good cut, and looks nice. It is shorter than expected. Fabric is paper thin and not breathable. Bc it is thin and short, I wear this as a dress or pair it with a pair of pants (tucked in like a shirt). Washes well. Color didn't fade on me. Although collar does, on occasion, stick out weird. Button is cheap. Print is super cute."
3.0,Wrong pattern for me.  The color was more red flowers and blue background.  I was looking for a different pattern with hot pink in it.
3.0,"The glasses are nice and pretty sturdy for the cheap price, but they aren't what I was expecting... According to the pic they are more of a matte mirrored finish and that's what I was looking for, but when they showed up they were just the regular mirror finish, still nice glasses though..."
3.0,They are to big for my small feet.
3.0,Perfect for the pool and such. They have already started to fray but they breath well and are easy to put on.
3.0,okay but not well made
3.0,"looks as pictured. was a little big in breast area, but its ok since its a wrap dress.<br />material feels really cheap and thin. I will say even though its thin, it is not see through, and the thinness is nice for summer. but the material really feels synthetic in a cheap unpleasant way.<br />I am losing weight, so its a great transitional piece, and cheap enough I don't feel bad about its temporary place in my wardrobe. So this could be the perfect dress or the worst one depending on your needs."
3.0,"It worked ok, for my four year old. She's  a solid size 3, very petite, and I got her the xs. I wish I had purchased the small because this will not work for next year. The t-shirt is standard one use quality and silk screen a bit faded after one wash."
3.0,I know we shouldn't be trying to be a blinged out when your trying to show your faith. But for me personally this is a little bit to humble. I plan on gifting to a friend rather than wearing myself.
3.0,Most smaller carabiner snaps do not have a good return; too much play in lower hinge so that must verify with each use that carabiner actually closed properly.  Most of the smaller snaps also have weak return (along with unreliable to slip back into proper slot).
3.0,I dislike the Stopping of it.just stop running have to keep resetting.But the Watch design and Color is Great!!
3.0,fabric looks somewhat fragile
3.0,Watch weighs heavy on the wrist
3.0,Very pretty earrings but the post length is shorter and I can't get them into my ears well. Maybe I have fat lobes lol very pretty otherwise but doubtful I will be able to use them.
3.0,"As soon I went to use the case the little fastener where it clips closed, fell off and does not clip back together."
3.0,I bought this as a requested gift.. its a pretty cheap screen print that looks (or maybe is) an iron on.  Not very high quality..
3.0,"I ordered these for a student performance for the professional ballet company I work for.  I ordered brown to match some brown tutus I ordered.  Unfortunately, the browns did not match which I was prepared for with ordering cheap costumes from China online.  The brown color that the leotards were originally had a strange greenish hue and I needed them to be more chocolate.  Luckily, I dipped them in a mix of Rit Chocolate brown and Rit Cherry Red and they turned out PERFECT!  So if you need a cheap leotard in a specific color, these leotards dye pretty nicely.  I did not get a picture of the original color.  I will update the review once I finish fittings with the dancers."
3.0,"I was looking for a hat that was more floppy and wavy like the one pictured, but got one that had a straighter brim. I know not every hat comes out exactly the same, but it was disappointing it wasn't more like what was pictured. Although it seemed like it was good quality and was crushable, which is always awesome. Only downfall is if you don't like it, you have to pay to return it. I'm a big fan of those companies now that do free shipping both ways. I don't feel like I've paid for half the item by the time I ship it back for whatever reason."
3.0,the black part is fuzzy. they're okay
3.0,"These ties are good quality. I can only rate them 3 stars because the colors are not quite right for the 'houses' they represent. The patterns are also close, but not exact, and I expect that is due to potential trademark infringement. The 'glasses' look just 'OK' as they are really a prop for a child. No lens of course and pretty flimsy."
3.0,"This is classy, cute and modest! But I wouldn‚Äôt reorder it again unfortunately, because it has a blend of polyester. I do terrible with polyester. It‚Äôs a culprit for bacteria and smell. I‚Äôm 150lbs and order a medium it was a perfect fit. Wish I could order more."
3.0,I liked the dress but my package was missing the cigarette holder that i was pretty excited about it.
3.0,"For me, it was too snug overall for the size label. Another size up and maybe it would work."
3.0,Cute fashion necklace!
3.0,Cheap charm fell off within a week
3.0,"Beautiful color.  Size is right on, no wiggle room."
3.0,"Cute dress, but the sizing is a little off."
3.0,"I returned his item because I did not like the fit. I like that the material was thin, but the bottem was to big.  Not like a pencil skirt should be. I was expecting spandex material but I would say felt more like cotton. Other than the bottem bigger to big I did like the skirt.  Would recommend for people with bigger thighs and calves."
3.0,It's nearly impossible to untangle... Looks different from the picture. Don't get if you have a long torso. Doesn't fit well. Looks cheap.
3.0,Beautiful skirt but the XL was too tight in waist even though I typically wear size 6-8 in jeans and/or medium or small in tops/dresses
3.0,"Fabric is a bit thin, but not bad for the price."
3.0,"The little bear is very cute.  However, it isn't easy to put on or take off as the strand is really short.  I thought for sure it would break the first time it was stretched out to fit over a 4 year old's head.  It didn't - the string the beads are on is quite strong and it does stretch more than I expected.  I just wish it were an inch or two longer."
3.0,"Had to remove those shoulder pads before anything else, it was giving grandma‚Ä¶ sorry. I thought the touching at the tummy would be flattering but it‚Äôs at an awkward angle so it just makes the tummy look weird. Not bad but not complimentary either‚Ä¶ I know I could use a sit up or few but this was just a weird look. I will diet and exercise eventually and see how it looks then but for now, it will be a pretty purple closet decoration."
3.0,"7 1/2"" if measured end to link ""tip"" when the clasp is open.  In the closed position as one would wear it, It only measures 7 1/8"" just in case you're running close on it fitting your wrist.  Seller should make that clear.  Other than that it's a 5 star for an item under six dollars."
3.0,"I bought these for a family member with parkinson's. If your on the short side, to average height, and looking for warm, quality made pants, these are the ones for you. They're really nice looking, very high quality, durable looking. If you are on the tall side, these definately won't fit your long legs. If this company made taller pants, I'd definately buy from them again, but they didn't have any advertised."
3.0,"They were okay, kinda feel cheap but considering the price it wasn't a big deal. My biggest issues  was the deliver method. They were sent in a giant envelope so they were not really protected. The nose pieces were a little bent so they sat crooked on my face. I was able to bend and adjust it better but i cant get them perfectly straight. You get what you pay for."
3.0,This top is really long. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äô and this went to my upper thigh...kind of makes the pockets useless.  I like the screened logo and the T-shirt was soft.  I donated it
3.0,Not as shiny and delicate as photo
3.0,Beads very small and more orange than red
3.0,I like the color. Earthy red. But there are holes in the pockets and the straps are bound to break they are weak little things and the adjustment hing makes the straps sit weird. Bad quality. Ordered a large. Could be bigger. But its ok.
3.0,"These gauges and tapers were bagged in pairs, however they weren't labeled. Also, I'm pretty sure that my 12G gauges were exactly the same size as the 14G gauges. I'm currently at a 10G now but for a week I had to wear the 12G tapers. Great price though!"
3.0,It is a stunning set but arrived with a broken earring.  I have to buy jewelry glue to repair the earring!
3.0,"I saw this geometric print sweatshirt on Amazon and loved it for my son. He saw it and loved it too! Online, the picture showed bold red and deep blue and teal hues with different values and shades. Unfortunately, when it arrived to our home the product did not match the picture online. It is actually lots of purple, lavender, and rose colored shapes. Definitely much more feminine and not what he was going for. I included photo of the online photo and my own shot. Believe it or not, it is even lighter and more pink and lavender in person than even my own photo image shows. Good quality rayon/nylon material which would probably hold it with multiple washings. Unfortunately it was not the color scheme we saw on the online photo so we will probably be returning."
3.0,Absolutely loved this bathing suit but it was unfortunately too small :( I wear a small in everything but this was just too small. Definitely recommend going one size up. The material is great for the price though so i'll definitelly be reordering a larger size!
3.0,"Cheap quality, but nice design"
3.0,"As other reviewers mentioned, the arms are very tight. Not so cute on arms like mine. I kept the colored cardigan as the color was more forgiving. But the white one was returned. Otherwise, remainder of product was as expected."
3.0,has weird holes in the sleeves not sure what for but I don't like them.. other than that shirt fits pretty well kinda loose.
3.0,"Its short in the torso and is not as fit as i thought it would be. But mostly like it anyhow, prolly just wont wear as often."
3.0,"I got this keychain for a new set of keys for my car.  I used it to also attach my regular home keys.  The keychain comes with 2 straps.  However, I found the straps were very stiff and not large enough to put around my wrist.  I like the cute colors with the sparkles and the d-rings to attach the car keys.  I am hoping that the keychain strap will soften up over time. The quality is just okay, not the best I have seen.  I think this is reasonable for the price."
3.0,Cute and light weight but the lenses were a little scratched up when I got them.<br />Update: currently at the lake on vacay with these. They DO NOT float. They just sink slower than normal. Still cute though.
3.0,"I knew it was crazy to get a one size fits all pajama bottoms, but I wear a range of sizes for bottoms depending on how they're made.  I wear a medium comfortably, large a little loose and small a little tight.  So I thought I'd be safe to get these bottoms, especially seeing how they hang on the model.  These are not a one size fits all and I couldn't imagine how someone bigger than me could get them on.  They were soft, but not quite as soft as I expected.  Unfortunately they weren't comfortable to lounge or sleep in because they were too restrictive."
3.0,"super cute, and goes well with my blue tassel key ring I bought! The jewel in the middle is super cheap looking. But as long as you handle with care I should last you."
3.0,These are hard to clean
3.0,"They are a bit big, if you have a small fee free this is not for you otherwise the product is good"
3.0,I got an xxl i would normally wear a m and its still a little more tight than i would like.
3.0,"Beautiful but synthetic, so difficult to breathe through. I‚Äôm returning it."
3.0,These are not the greatest quality....the spaghetti straps snapped on 2 of them the same day they were worn.
3.0,Dress pretty good but on small size would choose a bigger size if reordering
3.0,It‚Äôs more like a sweater material. Very hot. And the white was not white. More like a cream when you put next to something white.
3.0,"I love this bra, but it is difficult to get the correct size.  It is so comfortable and pulls the girls in and up.  The ""cup"" portion is misleading as it's really only part of the cup.  It fits differently than usual bras.  The fabric is lovely feeling.  The front hooks need to be crimped tighter or they come unhooked without warning. And it stretches out if you are well endowed.  I end up replacing it after about 6 months. But I still love it"
3.0,"I purchased this bathing suit to get some exercise and swim laps in the pool.  The exterior material has become loose and in the back the material sags when I get out of the pool.  The rest of the suit fits fine, but I really wouldn't recommend this product if you are going to be doing anything more than just a casual swim every now and then."
3.0,Loved the color (mauve/dusty rose) and length (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù)but there was too much material on a tight waste band that made me too way wider at the hips.
3.0,"It was a nice piece. The ends were just glued on and the glue was visible. I figured the could have scrunched in the top of the metal pieces so it doesn't look so obvious, but it's a fast fashion accessory. Shipping was fast."
3.0,"This robe would have been lovely had it fit. I got the largest size XL (I am normally a 16) and it was far too small.  Nice soft fabric and pretty color, but I can't wear it :("
3.0,"With so many similar  skirts .I went with Danskin because of the name .the material was not a good quality. Nothing like the way I remember Danson brand and I've owned many items for 40 plus years. Always nice but sadly..Everthing clings to this skort  pet hair ,lint .it's like a magnet.  I should of sent it back but already wore it .darn  ."
3.0,I dislike that the hat doesn‚Äôt fit my head at all. I can‚Äôt put it on.
3.0,"I'm rating this a three because I ordered the xl  which should have fit after reading reviews that it was a bit small. Well I then ordered the xxl and same issue, it fit my body but not my chest, I'm a<br />D cup,5ft 2 in tall I weigh 140lbs this should have fit in a large like all my other swim wear. This suit I would recommend for an a or b cup and go with suit size according to one size up from normal. Super cute suit though, very sad I had to return both of them."
3.0,"It's a good ring, but turned silver."
3.0,"Gold is too dark ""LOOKS SUPER FAKE""!"
3.0,It's sort of like a sack.
3.0,"I've re-organized my gear on this grid many times, and I'm never really satisfied. I really think that, in some ways, the solution makes way more sense than pockets in a bag. For instance, you can pull the whole thing out, and have access to a variety of tools during, say, a repair. But, in the end, I find the amount of friction involved (literally) with accessing my tools to be a pain in the neck, and so I've moved everything into a sort of tool sleeve or envelope, so each tool has its own pocket, basically. It's much easier to get the tools I need and put it back."
3.0,"The necklace leather is just wayyyy too big, if it was at least adjustable it would be fine, but since it is so big i don't even wear it."
3.0,Dress material was fine.
3.0,"The back of top was lower than the photo and the shorts were too short, butt cheek peeing out.  Almost true to size except for pants length. Overall a good fit. Reordering lager size, hoping pant may offer more coverage even if not as fitted.<br /><br />Will update once received."
3.0,"The buckle is heavy and the webbing seems to be decent quality. However, the belt will easily pop open when you bend or stoop down. Not the best design and too much of a fuss for daily wear."
3.0,Beautiful sandals however unfortunately needs some work by the designer. the back lace is loose at unadjustable causing the heel to slide off. I‚Äôll reorder if / when this flaw is fixed.
3.0,"I am 5‚Äô6 and ordered a small.  Doesn‚Äôt cover the honey pot, so I am returning."
3.0,"This is not a sweatshirt. It's a long sleeve heavy weight t-shirt. Buy big so you can layer, if you truly are cold all the time!"
3.0,"They look like the photo; however, they're way smaller than I imagined them to be."
3.0,Shinier than expected. Not quite what i was wanting. Maybe a little cheap? But will wear and it‚Äôs comfortable and fits like I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and Small was slightly long. But just doubled over the waist. Just wearing for around the house.
3.0,"This sweater is gorgeous, but the sleeves are quite loose and shorter than pictured.  I'm 5'5"", 125 lbs., 34 D and I ordered a small & a medium.  The medium is too large, but those sleeves are even too short to be comfortable and I do not have long arms, just average.  It's too bad, because I love the sweater!!"
3.0,Hi guys. So these are really cute and fairly made well. The only problem is they do not stay on your earlobe well. I have to keep pushing it back on to my ear lobe and even squeeze it together tighter hoping it won't fall down. I've tried to wear them abt 5 times so far and they always fall down.
3.0,"I keep looking for the perfect bra, but this is not it diesnt have good support"
3.0,Fabric looks well worn with one washing...
3.0,"I had hoped there would be some cushioning, like thin neoprene, but there wasn't. I had to double up to get some cushioning. better, but not really good. My earpieces are wider than most glasses and I couldn't find anything else that would work. Also, they don't stretch very much, and the seam causes bulkiness in use, making the doubling up hard to achieve."
3.0,My wife said it looked like a washer.  It's ok and does the job - I was homeliness it wouldn't irritate my skin and it didn't until I wore leather gloves to chop wood and it really aggravated my skin then.  Otherwise it's good and does the job fine.
3.0,"This suit is not adjustable at all, runs small, and doesn‚Äôt have the gem detailing as shown in the photos. It‚Äôs basically just shiny fabric.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 150, 34C and have hips. I‚Äôm a medium in VS swimsuits for reference. I ordered a large since bottoms ordered off amazon tend to run small. The top fit, but can‚Äôt be adjusted. I can imagine it would be difficult to wear for someone with large breasts. The straps on the bottoms dig into my hips (no matter where I put them) and just don‚Äôt look good. It has strings hanging from how it was made, so not great quality in that sense. Hope this helps!"
3.0,Not flattering. No support for big breasted women.
3.0,disappointed in this dress looks prettier in the picture
3.0,I have never in my life felt boots so light that they feel like the lightest paperweight. They don't even feel like real boots. There's no weight to them at all. My tennis shoes weigh way more than these things. I hope they don't fall apart easily too. :(
3.0,I did the size chart like it said and they don't really fit as well as they should.
3.0,It‚Äôs nice but it feels so much thinner than it looks in the pictures.
3.0,"Very pretty, a little thin."
3.0,I purchased two of these single watch winders.  I'm generally happy with them and their appearance is quite nice.  One of the winders is louder than the other.  So one is relatively quiet but the other is very noticeable when running.  The styling and appearance of the winder's is very nice.  They make a beautiful display for a nice timepiece.  I gave three starts because of the inconsistent noise level between the two that I purchased and the fact that one of the units if not very quiet.
3.0,"This looks WAY better in the pictures than in person. I was hoping this didn't look like it came from a cheap big box store, but unfortunately it does! The shoes are huge, and won't fit until 6 months from now at least. I'd recommend shopping around."
3.0,"I think maybe you need a banging body or shapewear to pull this off. For me, it accentuated my belly in a way I didn‚Äôt like. I‚Äôll be returning. (Me: 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 165lb)."
3.0,"The knot is pretty but overall small and the tassel is short giving the entire piece a cheap look, unfortunately"
3.0,"Pretty color and nice material, but I would recommend ordering a size or two up.  Runs small."
3.0,Material is cheap!!
3.0,Loved the bling.  Too large for my small wrist.  Turns my wrist green.
3.0,I have this in black. It washes beautifully. No shrinking. Purchased same size in 2 other colors and the quality was terrible! So disappointing.
3.0,They are ok just don‚Äôt like how the face is on both sides. Its on the front and back of the head
3.0,Run very small.  They seemed to look good and seemed to be decent quality.  But had to send back as they were too small.
3.0,"I've only had this band for a month or so and it's peeling up. The quality of the leather is lacking; it's very stiff and feels cheap. I don't wear it every day, yet it's wearing out rapidly."
3.0,"I ordered the Grey/Blue pant in XL and it fit, but just not as i expected.  I am 5'2 160lbs with thicker thighs;  I always order up with items like this  ( and usually run into the problem of it being too long). The pants fit, but  because of the material,I felt it was too close of a fit. Number 1 reason for return was because of the material.  It looked more like a gym pants rather than a dress/casual pants."
3.0,To start I bought them fir the long length tunic part of them but when I received them they were regular length. The material was the same the way I loved it on the longer ones I have bought in the past but. I am sorry to say I had to return it. They are out of the v neck ones but when they are back I am trying those out again since they have always been perfect.
3.0,I ordered 2x and it was real small. Order one size larger
3.0,"Form fitting for the most part. Decent stretch. Fabric is super itchy. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be a cotton or jersey but for 100% polyester I didn‚Äôt expect it to feel like it was made of sandpaper. Inside is definitely tougher than outside. Washed in some vinegar, helped a bit, going to need some ‚Äúbreaking in‚Äù"
3.0,"These are great shoes and I can stand or walk for a very long time without my feet hurting. However after a week of daily wear, the inside print was already wearing off. Kind of a bummer and hope this doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt last long."
3.0,Somewhat large. A size down would have fit<br />me better.
3.0,"I liked this sweatshirt but it ran a little small and the picture is not a good representation of the actual color. The picture looks like a rosy pink, gray and light gray but in fact it‚Äôs a bright red. It was comfy but snug on my arms will probably return for a size up."
3.0,It was way to long. Went below my knee.
3.0,Cheap looking abs the fit is small and awkward
3.0,Color of peacock feather doesn‚Äôt show up very well. Otherwise love it!
3.0,"I got it as a gift for a friend, but was a bit bummed that one side of he bracelet the metal was not connected properly. I thought this was a wrap, but it is stiff with an opening like the C shaped bangles that you slide on the arm. It just wasn't as well made as I had hoped."
3.0,Runs slightly small in the chest for a large. Nice quality though.
3.0,Its difficult to latch and unlatch the hook from the elastic loop. I had to cut away some material that was in the way.
3.0,"Great colors nice qualify nice and thick , a bit tight on the head, but thats better than loose<br />Love the variety of colors.<br />The only thing I have an issue with is the strong oil kind chemical smell<br />And I soaked these in fabric softener and washed them several times  , can not get rid of that smell for nothing<br />Tried about everything, will try to live with it"
3.0,Small in the chest area.
3.0,"I purchased this out of curiosity and because i had a gift card, I am not 100% impressed! the watch looks ok but being a watch collector myself, right away i could see that the quality is just not there. Leather band is ok, fits comfortably, but the rose tone seems to be just spray-painted over the watch case, really poor job done here! the watch sounds hollow as well which is a sign of poor quality and a poor mechanism running this thing. The rose gold tone will not last that is for sure however, this is just a $20 watch! not 10, not 30, just $20 nothing more! i gave it a 3star because it wears comfortably and it looks ok on the wrist! The blue tone looks black during the day unless you put the watch in direct contact with the light as shown on the pics. If you are looking for a cool watch to wear every day, then this may be a good piece to get. If you are a known watch collector then this is definitely not for you."
3.0,"Great quality top. However, at 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 150 lbs, with a 36 or 38 D, I‚Äôd like to hide my cleavage. This top just doesn‚Äôt give the full coverage I want. If you don‚Äôt mind cleavage, then this is about the farthest an XL will stretch. The attached photo shows what it looks like on me after a minute of putting it on and pulling it up to cover.my cleavage. This top is not loose on me at all (i definitely struggle pulling it over my bust), but it doesn‚Äôt want to stay up. The pads are removed."
3.0,"Necklace is perfect, but the chain necklace broke after one wear at random. It wasnt pulled or snagged."
3.0,Very large and clunky
3.0,Bonito dise√±o lo √∫nico malo es que el material es muy corriente.
3.0,WRISTBAND BIT TIGHT
3.0,"The dress is not plus size, I wear a 10 and while this dress fits in a 2x, it barely covers my hoohah-I'm 5'6. The dress is very flattering and cute, but I got it in navy and it's almost see through. This is a nighttime-club dress, not a church dress."
3.0,"The color is not as pictured and the fabric is not very high quality.  It feels like the ""classic"" white tanks sold in a three-pack.  The design is nice, which is why the stars given are three and not less."
3.0,It is really small for an XL and it shrunk more than most things do in the dryer. Had to get rid of it.
3.0,I love this dress I just ordered another but I bought a white one and I got a blue. Other than that it‚Äôs perfect
3.0,"Beautiful colours, but thinner and narrower than advertised. Returned."
3.0,"Does it look like the image? nope, not at all.  It looks like a regular hoodie on the light side, it is not bad, but not what I was expecting."
3.0,I love the print but the cut was very unflattering and I don't think the material hangs nicely on girls with curves...
3.0,"It looks nice, but a little cheaper than I had hoped."
3.0,"My girlfriend likes this purse, but it arrived all smashed. The bottom corner of the purse is bashed in.<br />The box looks fine, so obviously this is something on the seller's end. We are going to return the smashed one, hopefully the replacement one we order is undamaged!"
3.0,"If you have wide wrist, this may not work for you. It is super small and don‚Äôt stretch comfortable. I only used for running or exercise that way don‚Äôt move.<br />Quality is good tough."
3.0,This ring size runs one size small. I would order a size up next time or for any new purchases
3.0,not bad. its cute but could use a little more detail.
3.0,"When I received my earrings the silver bow was tarnished.  Disappointed with it but a little jewelry cleaner did the trick to make it shiny silver again.<br /><br />For the second pair of earrings, one of the earrings had a missing hook part. Not happy about it, but I was able to fix it with a spare earring part I had.<br /><br />Overall-the earrings are cute, but be warned that you might have to clean or repair them."
3.0,"This came advertised as a dress. This style came as a long sleeve tshirt and a skirt. Cute, but what was advertised. In fact,  the elves on the shirt weren't even in the picture because the shirt is ticked into the skirt to appear as a dress."
3.0,The fit was not as flattering on my body type.
3.0,"Not the best pair, quality is pretty cheap. But you get what you pay for. They will serve the purpose for what I got them for. Next time I will spend a little more for better quality."
3.0,"So yes the pants are very see through, only way i can explain is like the beach pants people buy that are meant to be see through. They are cute though and im just going to wear some spandex under."
3.0,The material is kinda heavy for a summer dress.
3.0,Weirdly shaped on the arms
3.0,"I measure myself and brought the item but it was too small for me, I needed to return"
3.0,"Pretty color, runs small in chest"
3.0,"Very comfortable and the elastic seems quality but they are sheer and the size Small wears like a large, for me. Bummer!"
3.0,The material is very thin. Only consolation is that it feels cooler in the summer months when it Is very hot.  Nice  bright color and has not faded after a half dozen washes.
3.0,I absolutely love the size and versatility of this bag however I noticed tearing on both sides of the zipper after only 1 day of carrying it!
3.0,"ok shirt....cotton was not as thick as expected. Waited a long time for delivery....weeks. Haven't washed, but looks like it will shrink...order larger size."
3.0,"Not the fabric I expected. But, okay."
3.0,Pants feel soft against my skin. They compliment my legs. Unfortunately they keep working themselves down and I find myself constantly pulling them up during my workout!
3.0,"WAY too small.  My daughter usually wears a 1.5 -2... she couldn't even get these on.  Other than that,  they were nice."
3.0,The shirt itself fits as expected however the arm holes resemble a ripped off teeshirt and will not cover a bra. I will not be wearing this out of the house. as the arm holes reach my lower sides.
3.0,I thought it would be smaller but I like it still
3.0,"The band gets stuck on everything, and it‚Äôs gotten scratched up so quickly."
3.0,"It's a keychain, how can it get screwed up?"
3.0,It was much smaller than expect
3.0,"runs small and as other reviewers said, the tulle is longer in the bottom but theres less of it so it is a bit awkward... tried to give it to my daughter but she didnt want it so itll have to be returned"
3.0,Cute but cheaply made. Material isn't soft at all.
3.0,"They are really cool looking and the material feels good. Only issue I have is, I don't like how visible the bar that goes through your piercing is. I hoped that I could adjust how tight it could be. So instead it looks like a partial hoop that's too big with a small bar pulling your earlobe down. IDK. I don't like that small bar or the piercing hole to show when wearing an earring."
3.0,Bought medium. And they were a little to thin. Then i washed them and not they are small. Imagine this. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3 and my wife is 5‚Äô1. These shorts are now hers and her butt looks awsome.
3.0,The bottoms are super cute the top is made weird. The cups fit but the band rode up high on my back to have it tight enough. I'm keeping it because it was so cheap and I'm using a different top with it. I am a size 12-14  and a 42DD bra size.
3.0,"Would never pay more than a fraction of retail price for these.  Comfortable but not nearly as well-made as they first appear.  First pair barely lasted six weeks before splits appeared in the soles, probably from walking around on my patio.  Did not expect them to wear out so quickly!  Bought a second pair on the cheap but will only wear them indoors on carpeted floors."
3.0,"This is a nice dress. It is true to size. The only fault about this dress is that the pockets do not lay flat and can make the sides flare out as if you stuffed something large in the pocket. Im going to sew them shut to lay flat. Now that i have to pay $10 to sew the pockets shut, the dress is not worth the price."
3.0,Much smaller than expected.  Would definitely not fit the breast in the image.
3.0,"These masks weren‚Äôt really for me , they are super stretchy though. The only thing about them is that they suffocate your mouth. You breath in a little and the mask is going right in your mouth. Your lips are easily visible as well/: 5/10"
3.0,"I like the vest with multiple pockets, but I ordered size L (US size) they sent me size 4XXX????  It was a little big and the fabric is OK.  I decided to keep it so that I can wear over my sweater in the wiinter."
3.0,The necklace tangles very easily when worn. Which then makes the metal get buckle where it tangled.
3.0,Backs didnt fit. Lost one  first wearing!
3.0,Not as vibrant as photo... I got the olive tone - but fits nice and pockets are a plus.. very cute!
3.0,Not true to size and slip off easy
3.0,"These are very attractive but came a bit bent. I was able to fix them, for the price, great buy"
3.0,It's an okay bag. It's more heavy duty then I expected. I was kinda hoping it was a softer bag. The velvet is fake velvet that doesn't look like velvet. At least it's not the cheap looking Halloween stuff. The leather straps look like they might wear out fast. The logo inside the bag looks like it's slapped on crooked but at least it's on the inside of the bag. Not sure how I feel about the shoulder straps since they look too fuzzy.<br />It's still probably a great bag for some people but I'm not so fond of it as I thought I'd be.<br /><br />It is larger then expected so I'll probably use it as a beach bag. It can fit a smaller or medium towel.
3.0,I had to return it. It was too small. It was cute and looked made well.
3.0,Nice glasses just ordered the gold/red and got the pink
3.0,"It fits, however, not your typical sizing, order up. Smaller in the top half area."
3.0,Nice dress has stretch but for me the material is a little too thin but I wear it with a throw over
3.0,"I like it, but it‚Äôs little bit shabby. I brought it  the sale price so it's fine with me. If I have to the proper price, I may not be happy."
3.0,"Me agrado el dise√±o, no me agrado que ven√≠a mal cosido en algunas partes o sin costuras, me toc√≥<br />Mandarla coser aparte, y los pantalones muuuu grandes, compre<br />Otro pantalon negro<br />Para poderlo usar‚Ä¶7 de 10"
3.0,Bonita pero gigante
3.0,Much thinner than expected and its a beautiful print on the pants but its a print.
3.0,Its okay.  gave it as a gift
3.0,I found these help my rainy night vision and bright daytime sun glare but made no difference any other time.
3.0,Arrived broken but was an easy fix. Arrived on time and just like the picture
3.0,"after it aired out a few days, it was O.K."
3.0,The dress doesn‚Äôt hang off the shoulder properly and the sequince isn‚Äôt that great but it‚Äôs a cute dress going to wear it to a friends wedding I guess
3.0,Not recommended on tall women... but they look ok...
3.0,"I thought this top would be good for work, but its more like a t-shirt gathered at bottom.  I recommend for only home casual use.  It is comfortable, but not stylish"
3.0,"Too tight to pull on unless legs are not already beginning to swell.  Also very difficult to remove once legs do swell, despite socks.  They do help more than most pairs we've tried.  Just still in search of the perfect product."
3.0,"Fits as expected, but the material is cheap and hot. The main problem is the color is way off. This is more of a blue-green, so that is disappointing. Besides that it will do."
3.0,"I ordered to wear these post c-section asbi thought high waist would be comfortable. I normally wear a size S. 4 weeks post-partum, was back to size S... but these pinched horribly in the torso and leg opening."
3.0,"About a week or so after I wrote the below, I hate to report that the balls are not holding up well for our small children at all. Like many others have reported - the balls no longer hold air. I am taking away 2 stars for the product itself but leaving 3 stars because of the customer service. The same day that I contacted them with an issue, they were in touch with me about how to resolve it. So while I am disappointed in the product, I am happy with the way they resolved the situation. I would not recommend this ball unless you want it for something other than to play basketball or any kind of sport with...<br /><br />We were looking for a small basketball for our 5 and 2 year old daughters. They have just started wanting to play with their older brother so I really wasn't looking to spend $40 on some of the ""brand' basketballs out there in order to get a color besides orange - only for them to get bored with it in 2 weeks. They love mermaids so when I found this - and for like $12 - I didn't even read the reviews and just bought two. They work just fine for us so far - no trouble with air leaking out. They haven't been heavily used yet, but they've had them for several days now with no problems. Anyways I'm glad I took the chance! With Amazon returns being so easy, it was worth it to me to take the risk and had I experienced any of the problems below, knew I could just return it. Anyways - based on our experience I would recommend!"
3.0,"Sadly, these Lock Lace knock-offs are just mediocre.  There are two issues: 1) the cords are thinner & the have less resistance so your shoes fit more loosely, 2) the lock mechanisms are weak & won't always hold the laces in place.  It's too bad the real Lock Laces don't offer the dark gray color I wanted for my shoes."
3.0,"Had an awkward fit, cannot adjust."
3.0,nice necklace but after you wear it a while is starts changing color
3.0,I love the style of this bikini but the top is way too small. I am a dress size 6 (34DD bra) and ordered a medium.
3.0,Honestly it depends on your shape. I thought it made me look wider.
3.0,Can't seem to get this band OFF of the watch.
3.0,Too expensive and too small. Saw someone with this similar hat. Hers was a little bigger and I liked hers better. It clipped to your hair with a snappy barrette.
3.0,Pretty bag. But zipper broke after 2 weeks of light use
3.0,Expected the top to be a little less tight than it is.
3.0,A little too expensive for the size and quality!
3.0,What is up with the cups in the front?  Disappointed in the appearance of it.  I bought one similar and loved it.  Just not crazy about the cups or fit on this particular one.
3.0,Very disappointed in the size. The overall length - including bale - is less than one inch. It looks like a child's pendant!
3.0,"Touch feature on gloves not consistent, but still very warm during cold nights out"
3.0,Same as their d-rings described as ‚Äúsilvery‚Äù but it‚Äôs nickel plated‚Ä¶. Pictures make it look much darker (like black chrome or gun metal)<br />It definitely is nickel plated
3.0,So they are lose fitting and I dont like the feeling their falling off my feet. not a fan of boot socks
3.0,My beautiful rainbow watch snapped at the hinge
3.0,Description didnt state a size and it was a too big for my female head. I made it work for the evening but doubt it gets another wearing.
3.0,"First of all, how the heck do you even wear this?<br />After I took like an hour to figure that out it was too small and I am not really looking for something that ties around my neck."
3.0,Stock picture is a little deceiving. Part of the necklace is bigger than the other.
3.0,After reading the reviews I sized up and ordered.  It‚Äôs definitely not a sweat outfit material nor is it thick.  The hoodie fits well but the pants are small and really really long and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8.  Keeping it only because I like the hoodie otherwise I would return.  I usually wear a small- medium and got a large.  I wouldn‚Äôt say I recommend only because the pants are so ridiculously off.
3.0,I wanted to be able to rate this higher but the boobs are really weird and you can see the boob pads and it just looks super awkward :(
3.0,"I really like these shoes, in part because they don't have the outer ridge like Birkenstocks, which are similar. That being said, they also don't have the same level of arch support. But the biggest drawback for me was that upper strap came apart under the buckle after only a month of wearing. I remedied this with contact cement reinforced with a crisscross of leather thread which seems to be holding up fine, but I'm not inclined to buy another pair."
3.0,"they're nice looking in person, just like the photo. But I'd get another pair because they're awfully snug and I've got super scrawny arms so that's really saying something. If you leave them scrunched up they're fine but don't pull them up your arm."
3.0,No for me
3.0,"The stone fell out, while I was using the sink [I surmise, as the 1/2 stone could not be found.<br />Unfortunate, as I liked the item very much.  Why must they skimp on a daub of glue, for heavens sake.  Do they want Customers to return the ring?"
3.0,"The design is as pictured, but it is so fragile. I would not buy again !"
3.0,nice but stretch a bit tight
3.0,"It stated falling apart after the first wear, but I should have expected it for the price."
3.0,"My nose hurts constantly!!! Not a good one for adults. I tried it, my bro tried it. Felt like getting blisters right away as soon as you try it on. Had to file down the part where it sits on the bridge of my nose to make it bearable. Still didn‚Äôt last. Not worth the pain and discomfort to use"
3.0,"I received these sunglasses and was slightly dismayed at their size. If you have an abnormally large head, these would work perfectly. However, on some occasions when I really want to wear snazzy sunglasses, I wouldn't mind being seen in public with these on.<br /><br />The color looks exactly like it does in the picture and was packaged very nicely. No scratches or scuffing. Seems high quality!"
3.0,Material is way different from what you see in the picture
3.0,I love this pin but I wish it looked more obvious the frog has its middle finger up. You can hardly tell if you didn't already know. He more looks like he's waving which is why this didn't get rated 5 stars. He's still cute tho
3.0,"This shirt was a smidge small and stretchy material, not soft tshirt material"
3.0,A jewel broke of after one wear. I'm a big girl and this was way too big for my wrist. It's pretty but not easy to wear.
3.0,"Instructions.  On the inside but kinda sticking out you'll see a charging port . The item comes with small charger and USB.  So you'll need the end for the USB to stick into outlet . Plug in . The mask will black green . Charge a while . Once done , the same little part u charged from . On it, u can't really feel it . Is a button , push it down ans hold it for 3 to 4 seconds then the mask will turn on and you'll see the first setting . It's a mouth , if u want the next one.  Hit the same button and the next one will come up . It has 6 or 7 I belive .<br /> Some move, some don't,  some change colors,  others have mouths that move.  If u are done and want to turn it off . Hit the same button u used the whole time.  But , press and hold . After 5 seconds . The mask will turn off ."
3.0,"It's a nice dress, but was a bit small for the sizing."
3.0,"Print came together weird at the seams. It's a really heavy,  tight knit,  nice fabric."
3.0,Dress fits exactly as expected. The material is thin but comfortable and breathable. Definitely a spring or summer dress. This dress is not black with white polka dots as I thought. It's actually navy blue which is hard to tell from the picture. But I'm keeping it due to comfort and fit.
3.0,The sizing run small but it was ok
3.0,Measured my niece's foot to determine size. They are still way too big.
3.0,"This was listed as a women's cross-body; however, it is quite small and seem to be more suitable for teens--or perhaps small-framed women or Asians."
3.0,The product quality is lower than I expected. The plastic feel cheap and it somehow does not align with the EA brand name.
3.0,"First impression - nice LOOKING shirt. I washed in cold water, no dryer - and it shrunk, definitely not cotton although the care tag says 100% cotton. Good thing the shirt is over-sized or I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to wear - even once - the size small I bought. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this shirt."
3.0,"This dress was slightly smaller than expected.  In addition, the material was a little thinner that I originally wanted.  However, I will keep the dress as and wear for a very casual occasion"
3.0,"Size is a little off.  I used the sizing chart to make my purchase, but it is still a little too small.  I like the dress and am hoping to lose weight so I can fit into it."
3.0,Arms were somewhat snug - and that's before being washed. So I returned the shirt.
3.0,"Box is on same price as Cavenders but is much thinner top compartment does not sit well on the bottom one, advice is buy the name brand! About same money"
3.0,"Cheaply made, but it does what it is supposed to do."
3.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It's very flattering in person, although a little sheer. I would not necessarily attach the words ""designer quality"" but it has plenty of cute details. Unfortunately, when I turned around in the dress, the under-slip barely covered my butt. And beyond the slip is nothing but sheer material. The dress fit well otherwise. I wish I could keep it, but I'm very concerned about exposing myself in this dress!"
3.0,This scarf isnt very full looking when worn. I wasnt expecting something amazing but I was expecting it to be a tad bit more high quality. Oh well I suppose you get what you pay for.
3.0,I like that the material is heavy. I don't like that the straps came apart.
3.0,The pull cords stretch out other than that no issues.<br />It will work for the purpose I'm using this for but need something a bit bigger
3.0,"Color is more crimson...top is not what it appears. This is not lapel shoulder wrap, it is solid stitched together."
3.0,"I received this dress about 3-4 weeks earlier than I thought I would. I went up several sizes due to the fact Asian sizing  runs very small. I actually could have bought my normal size as the fabric is VERY stretchy, but it is also VERY thin! It shows every lump, bump, or bulge you have and is also pretty sheer so make sure you get the right under garments! I bought it for a cruise, and it will be comfortable...and for about 10.00 you can't beat it."
3.0,"Don't like the polyester, looks cheap, cotton looks nicer."
3.0,"This is so cute and I was so excited to receive this product and rock it on a night on the town but I ended up looking like a sack of potatoes. Quiet literally. The fit is too loose on the back and the waist is too tight, it's strange I don't know anyone shaped that way. Quality and design was good but this was a return."
3.0,"It's a nice wallet and looks cool. big enough to fit money, cards, keys...in.<br /><br />however it had a really bad plastic smell when it arrived and even now, weeks later, can still smell it a bit"
3.0,Bought this dress sleeveless white with blue flowers printed on it. The flowers look a little blurry to me. The fabric is thin and being white needed a full slip. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for the back neckline to be a wide scoop rather than matching the front boat neckline. The dress had nice lines and fitted fairly well. The top was a little bit big/wide I think because of the back neckline.
3.0,Cute dress but had to return it as it fit too tight across my chest but fit below (size small).
3.0,"sadly its a bit thin and you can see the wefts in the back,but it got here fast and is at least the right color"
3.0,Does not look too great unless you have very large wrists
3.0,The color is not like the one in the picture
3.0,"Its beautiful, but the little hook that holds them together is very sharp and scratched my neck/chest. I would have expected to be more ""polished"". I have never had a charm to hurt me when wearing."
3.0,Cute but GIANT
3.0,"I ordered the Ruby necklace and they sent me the Bella necklace, very disappointed. This is something that you could gift to a young teenager. It‚Äôs not very high quality. It comes in a nice neutral colored box with black satin inside."
3.0,"Although it did not arrive on the date of 1/11/22, it arrived on 1/17/22. It is a nice look."
3.0,"It's just okay.  The fit is just a bit off.  No matter how it's tied, the material will bunch either above or below the belt.  I think the problem is really with this TYPE of shirt dress, not just this specific dress.  Allegra K makes beautiful clothes and this is no exception.  I really, really like the look of the dress, and it would look nice layered under a long sweater or jacket, but on its own it is uncomfortable.  It just doesn't lay right!"
3.0,"very comfotarble, however the edge of the strip very difficult to push inside,<br />very difficult"
3.0,These pants are OK. I bought them a size larger than I normally wear because they are linen cotton. My only advice is that you size up ‚Äì two sizes if you want to put them in the dryer. I‚Äôm wearing them right now but they‚Äôre not as loose as I wanted them to be and expected because I ordered a size larger.
3.0,Too many feminine colors or patterns.  Hard to keep on
3.0,My main con is the material could be considered sheer. But the design and cut ofthe shorts are great.. im 5ft..146 thick bottom half and the flare on the L was a bit too much for me.
3.0,The sizing is a little off on the breast. or it would be great
3.0,Doesn't seem to help but it's a nice accessory to some outfits.
3.0,"This is very nice robe, just do not like the color.  Fits well."
3.0,"I love the bottoms to this item, but he top is weird. It‚Äôs too big in the band, but too small for my breast. My boobs almost slip out with little movement. I ordered a medium because everyone close to my size said it was true to size. I guess I‚Äôm just the one who it doesn‚Äôt work for. It was worth it for the bottoms though!"
3.0,"The fabric for this dress is beautiful and the dress isn't sheer. I expected since it is in Asian sizing that it would run short- it does not. I am curvy and short. I wish it fit without a ton of alterations, but it is made for a taller, slim person."
3.0,"Initially, I loved these socks, I got them as a gift for my husband. He loves them and wore them until they had holes. Unfortunately, over time the green color fades to a really light sea green almost. Bummer because I really love the lime green look when their new. Otherwise really thick, nice socks."
3.0,I love the clogs except they didn't run true to it's size and we lost the eyes on the second day of wearing them but all in all i do like them.
3.0,"I really liked the set but the top is really small. The bottoms are a little tight but I‚Äôm okay with that, I can‚Äôt even wear the top because my chest doesn‚Äôt fit in. Amazon recommended sizing down and I would definitely not do that!"
3.0,Did not have long enough ties.  Will have to add to it.
3.0,Disappointed- the logo is basically a cheap iron on and will probably peel off with first wash. Also the gray bill is like sweatshirt material. Very thick
3.0,It's not slouchy. At all. It's a regular beanie.
3.0,"I'm 5'3"" and this skirt was too long for my liking. Pretty color, just too much skirt."
3.0,"Good belt, but I would not buy it over other chain belts since they are way cheaper. It's not as comfortable as Greg describes them if you put more weight than 50 lbs."
3.0,Pretty colors. These do not stay on my daughter's head well.
3.0,"Ordered an XL, but this shirt fits like a Large in both length and width."
3.0,Disproportionate to an actual human face.
3.0,Apparently I didn't have my glasses on when I bought this. It would be perfect if the American flag wasnt ruined with leopard print!!  I thought it was just a distressed look<br />nothing screams proud to be an American like a heart flag with leopard print!!<br />If you dont mind that then go for it.. It would be awesome without it
3.0,Very comfortable even though I got the wrong color.
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and this was SO short... didn‚Äôt even fit me as long as some t-shirts haha.<br /><br />So if you‚Äôre a shorty, it‚Äôs very cute and a good shape."
3.0,Lenses are much bigger than expected.  They take up most of my face like down to under my cheeks.
3.0,Nice but ends not finished very well.  Threads hanging and looks nice all but sort of cheap when you see the ends.
3.0,"The pink is not actually pink. It seems more like a mauve color. I wonder if the company changed it because other pics didn‚Äôt look like this. I do like that you can make the sash more or less empire, depending on your body type. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 142 lbs and I got the small"
3.0,"I purchased the black orchid And it is a very sheer fabric, which isn‚Äôt really represented in the photo, where it looks very opaque.  I purchased this as a standalone dress not as a swim cover-up. I really like it so may save it for Vegas, pair it with some black undergarments but wouldn‚Äôt wear it to a family affair."
3.0,although its cute I will be returning it because its see through!!!
3.0,These are not compression shirts.  Nothing about them compress lol purchased a size smaller like some of the other reviewers suggested and still not enough to ‚Äúcompress‚Äù.  Keeping them because they‚Äôre cheap and I can use them under my jackets but I would not purchase these again.
3.0,"Love the silhouette, great fit. Loved the fabric the first time I wore it. However the material pulls quickly. I washed and dried as directed. Oh well, it's still cute."
3.0,I like the suit fine.
3.0,The me brackets looks very nice however the brown broke after just a few days of wear.
3.0,not a great dress material is not very nice
3.0,Did not return because didn't try on befor discarded tags
3.0,esta linda pero esperaba mejor dise√±o esta como borroso
3.0,Loved the print the shoulders fits a bit weird.
3.0,"The bracelet looks identical to the picture but the leather is super stiff and feels like plastic making it somewhat uncomfortable to wear. I have average to slim wrists and this fits rather tightly. If you don't look closely it appears to be one long leather strap but it is two attached together, also the fastener is large and clunky which may be the style you're going for. I'm hoping in time the leather will soften up a bit, maybe if I work with it, perhaps let the cats have it to bat around and chew on so it gains something of a lived-in look."
3.0,"Weird compartment/divider in the middle and the lack of structure makes it kind of lumpy when you put things in.  I have since hacked the inside of the bag to remove that compartment and while the structure is still odd, it's a sturdy bag and I am able to use it to throw absolutely everything that will fit inside of it and use it to schlep my stuff with me everywhere."
3.0,"It's a bit tight, but the style is really cute. I would definitely get a bigger size"
3.0,"I got this as a beach bag and for one person it's just the right size for shoes, snacks, sunblock, etc.  The outside seems really well made, the zippers and handles appear very sturdy.  But the interior pocket ripped out the first time I used it for my phone and keys.  It was never back stitched so it wasn't rough use or overloading, the threads just unraveled.  There is still the zipper pocket, but I'm just frustrated with quality and feel very &#34;meh&#34; about the whole thing now.  I don't know how likely every bag would have this happen, but if you don't mind the side pocket ripping out or feel good about throwing a couple of extra stitches in there, I feel pretty good about the rest of the bag holding up for a while."
3.0,"These were way to small. If you‚Äôre going to purchase these, I would order a size up."
3.0,The color and script of this are exactly as shown. The cut is kind of weird and boxy. It doesn't fit well and only looks alright if it's tied up in the middle in a knot. Not exactly what I was going for. I wouldn't purchase this again for a casual t-shirt.
3.0,The material is see through and thin. The fit was a little on the small side as well.
3.0,Not quite as I expected it to be. Its ok. Its decent and fit for church and that's a good thing.
3.0,A little small and it‚Äôs more Halloween costume- ish. I wore it as a costume to a Mardi Gras ball. So it was fine.
3.0,"I like the product just wasn‚Äôt able to get it in the size I wanted for my son. I tried to purchase the item with a note asking to wait for the proper size, when they got it in stock. Got no response to that inquiry, just a refund. So I bought it again in the only siZe they had. Still think I should have received an response to my inquiry."
3.0,My 2 year old son loves character clothing. Fabric is flimsy.  Runs very big.  Will keep it as knock around outfit.
3.0,Way huge.
3.0,The stress marks are in illogical places.  Looks fake.  I had to take a belt sander and work over these shorts before wearing them.
3.0,Love this dress its beautiful the only down side is the collar looks ripped across it and does not have smooth edging. The dress is thin. Other then that it's a good dress
3.0,They were exactly what I wanted but they tarnished really quickly
3.0,"Love the shirt however, runs short. Looks fine with another black tank top underneath"
3.0,The shirt is very small compared to the pants. It‚Äôs runs very small and tight.
3.0,"Cute dress, comfortable fabric, love that it has pockets but unfortunately it‚Äôs about 4 inches too long for me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 110 pounds - ordered a small)."
3.0,"I bought these socks because  the description states they are 19"" tall from the heel upward. I was excited because I need a tall sock for my muck boots. They are thick and warm, but pretty tight and short. I am female, 5' 6"" so if you are a 5' person, they would probably be long enough for you."
3.0,"I'm a big girl, no doubt (I got a green XL), but this top is very tent-like. It looks like a big moo-moo or something on me. I'm not sure what the problem is - I think it's the general tailoring of it. The lower part of it hangs straight down and the arm holes are huge.<br /><br />The material is nice and it steam-ironed out nicely, but it's something I'll never wear because of how it fits and looks on me."
3.0,"I was sent 2 of the same color, one of which looked to have been a returned item, not wrapped like the other pair. They look nice on though and seem to help cut out the blue light from my computer."
3.0,"It bunches weirdly at the waist making it look like fat rolls. I don‚Äôt have fat rolls goodness I look like there‚Äôs a spare tire around my middle. For reference, I‚Äôm a small person, I‚Äôm a ballet teacher by trade."
3.0,Weird fit. The skirt part is big and the arms are kids size. If you're petite then this a little long.
3.0,I was really excited to order this but when it came I was shocked. I guess I should‚Äôve read the reviews but buyer beware! The reviews are correct. It does NOT come with 110 pieces.. maybe half IF THAT. Also some of the pieces come with no balls... see picture. Very disappointed. It is NOT worth the money at all.
3.0,I don't help as much as I had hoped.
3.0,The pads move around a lot so be aware your boobs might look lopsided at times lol but it‚Äôs cute and the pads are removable
3.0,"The drawstring doesn‚Äôt work well and the gaiter doesn‚Äôt stay up over your nose. It is warm and effective around your hair or neck, but it doesn‚Äôt work as a mask or facial gaiter."
3.0,"This runs way bigger than a medium, the accessories it come with will not even stay on my waist but it is made very well for the price"
3.0,Nice fabric and cute style.  However it comes with cups so that you don't need a bra and those are not pleaced where needed for a good fit.  Also they are hard and not too comfortable.  I returned it
3.0,Love the color and style. Runs a bit on the small size.
3.0,Comfortable and looks okay. Sound quality is terrible and you have to wear it a certain way or the large cheap plastic hardware boxes dig into your head.
3.0,"Real cute but not very functional.  Won't hold a check book and small wallet / phone.  Probably wll only use it when I am wearing black and white out for the evening.  Kinda cheap, I think the snaps will break soon"
3.0,The dress fits really really nice but I gave it a 3 star because I thought the dress would be more neon but it's more of a mustard yellow.
3.0,This piece is way to big for my nose. It's pretty but I cant wear it.
3.0,"I like the shorts, they are exactly as described. Fit is good also. I ordered a medium (im 5'7, 160lbs, I wear size 30 in mens jeans) overall im content with the look and fit.. just have one issue with the stitching of the patch. It's already falling off, its loosely secured and probably falls off after a wash or 2."
3.0,"Way bigger and more cumbersome than it needs to be. While empty, it's thicker than my other full wallet."
3.0,"These glasses look great, and the blue light lenses don't have that weird orange tint, so they're more discrete. But if I wear it for more than an hour, it gives me a headache and some disorientation. I have a lower nose bridge than most people, so I need my glasses to have adjustable nose pads."
3.0,They are good just wish they had more security around the wrist so they don't fall off like regular gloves
3.0,10 out of the 12 worked great
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:b062b047ddacc22ef50096e6e630e59b]] The dress is such a beautiful dress, however , as other reviews say, the top is too little. This dress hugs me good and it‚Äôs comfy but, yes watch the chest WITH YOUR LIFE. And I ordered a size above, this dress is meant more for A-B cups. I am C36 and it‚Äôs why I say BEWARE, just remember guard those boobs.<br />I‚Äôm about 173 or 174 , and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3<br />I ordered a size above so no matter what you size you get the top might still be too little, I would normally wear a medium but i ordered a large cause I thought the top would be bigger."
3.0,"They're really not good in cold weather and the size is not true to fit a bit small but, the look's great and they work my devices."
3.0,"Awesome, great design, cute. Note, sizes run small... XXL didn't fit a 9 year old"
3.0,A bit small. I am not really over weight but it runs a bit small so that I barely have any excess strap to tuck
3.0,Cute onesie but runs really large. I got the 4-6 months and it looks more like it would fit a one-year old.
3.0,colors are much more subdued than on the website
3.0,"i enjoy the perks of solid gold and was not used to seeing my ear lobe green when removing these cute earrings. the style is so adorable, the quality, not so much"
3.0,"The print is good, but it does get stretched out while wearing. They came up to my calves."
3.0,Turn her finger green
3.0,not made for a lot of walking
3.0,"The chain was gangly and a bit cheap, broke after considerable use."
3.0,"Returning. This shirt would have been great if it was 2-3 inches longer. It barely met the top of my jeans, which are maybe an inch from my belly button. So unless you wear it with high waisted jeans, or want to show your midriff, then this isn't the shirt for you."
3.0,loved bracket bought 2 but 1 came broken(damage) but kept it and paid for it because its jade stone send picture to amazon
3.0,the color was lost after a few days.
3.0,Very cute but the size runs small; bought a 9-10 and it fits more of a 7-8.
3.0,Too big and rather skinny.
3.0,I couldn't get them on. Size chart provided is misleading. They look high quality and nice if you can get them on.
3.0,Nice feeling material. Product runs small as expected so I ordered a size up and it fits perfectly.  The graphics on the back looks kind of dull in color like it's been washed several but still very beautiful. Not bad for the price
3.0,The necklace was very good except it was not as described. The necklace was to have a 2 inch extender which it did not have
3.0,They kept falling off in the ocean waves.
3.0,"Good sock but, it's fit is not really that good if you have a smaller foot size. The sock comes up my calf way to far, I was hoping to ware them with shorts this summer and I will have to fold them over and look like a 50's &#34;BobbySocker&#34;"
3.0,Feels good but a seam is starting to open after 3 washings
3.0,Hat material quality is good. Logo is a  decal that feels thin and a little gummy. I returned because the glue from product label sticker wouldn't come off & left a sticky spot on brim of hat that would collect dust/dirt over time.
3.0,keeps toddler bracelet necklaces headbands organized. wish bars stayed on better. easily knocks over. this is the only organizer that keeps her 50+ tiny bracelets neat.
3.0,Lovely image on it but I don't know how this can be a beanie. It's soooo thin. It doesn't keep my head warm at all. Don't like that part of it.
3.0,Would havebbeen nice if they'd fit
3.0,I look like a fat pilgrim. I‚Äôm small (shoulder to shoulder I‚Äôm 11 inches) but have big breasts. The<br />front has a collar that drapes over which doesn‚Äôt flatter big breasted women.<br /><br />Fabric is a bit stiff with a little amount of stretch. I was hopping for a softer silky feel.
3.0,I'm a 36 DD with an hourglass figure. I usually am a medium (what I ordered) to large. Soft material but very staticky. It's too loose in the stomach and smashes my boobs. Even If I did get a large it would still suffocate the girls. A medium would probably fit a c cup the best or anything smaller
3.0,"3 stars from me because the lining of the jacket i received was different than pictured.  I ordered the Navy jacket, which shows colorful circular shaped images, but what arrived was a floral design just like the others.  That's not my look, so it's going back."
3.0,"I love this bag. However, if you intend to use it daily, the material on the straps starts to peel on the edges. Not sure how long they will last , but only having this for a month, a little concerning"
3.0,Too much flare for my taste
3.0,"I love the shoes and they are comfortable, but I did have to buy a half size larger than my normal shoe size. The charge on the shoes does not last long maybe about 3hours."
3.0,Daughter wore Small in the skirt part and Medium in the shirt.
3.0,"A cheap knockoff, but cozy and adorable either way"
3.0,Not impressed with the construction.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this swim suit. The top is a bit awkward fitting. I made a few adjustments that helped, but the size chart is a bit deceiving. I had to return the first one because the chart told me based on my size I needed an XL, was instead sent a 2XL.  In reality, I was closer to a large (which I ordered the 2nd time), and even with that I had to make alterations. After washing there have been no discolorations and it seems to be holding up well."
3.0,"Too small, but so cute!"
3.0,It does not fit like I wanted but its OK.
3.0,"I wear a 6 1/2 and these are a bit big. Also, the non-skid bottoms aren't very non-skid. But they are soft."
3.0,The gloves are warm but they are very clumsy there's no way you're going to use a little touchscreen with them on
3.0,"I like it, but the odd small pleat in the center front bothers me."
3.0,Works good but the color is not exactly the bright neon green as shown in the photo.
3.0,"While the mask fit and remains water-tight, the earplugs do not stay in."
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù tall and about 120 and the small fit perfectly.  Very cute dress but I had to return because you can see right through the thin gray material.
3.0,"They are great overalls!  However, with all the hype about them running small I ordered larger than I normally wear and they are really roomy after many hot washes. I would suggest just 1size larger."
3.0,"It's looser than expected, and the quality of the fabric is eh, but maybe I'll wear it."
3.0,"It started coming apart at the seams the first time he wore it and it was way smaller than expected. Order a size up if you want a one time use Halloween costume. If your kids enjoy dressing up and wearing costumes more than a few times, buy a better quality one."
3.0,Very cute but xlg is like a childs small. Beware
3.0,I love that they have pockets and are not see through but the waist band isn‚Äôt so sturdy and it slips down all day if the waist band was tighter material would be better
3.0,These are cute. The eye fell off after a few wears but cute shoes for the price. My 4 year old thought they were great but she can‚Äôt seem to close them herself they‚Äôre just a tad hard.
3.0,"These won't stay on the earpiece like they should. They slip off and  I don't have any idea how to stop that from happening. Other than that, they are well made, just don't work for me."
3.0,Wish these gloves a little longer. Over all they are nice gloves. They do worn out too fast.
3.0,The material bunches up. I didn't read carefully and it's not cotton on the printed part. It's slick and rides up toward the neckline.
3.0,"A little larger than I expected, and it was so wrinkeld that I will need to have it dry-cleaned prior to use, but otherwise it's a pretty cute outfit."
3.0,"The shoe is very narrow. Fit in length, but too narrow."
3.0,I ordered these to wear to work as I thought they would be a nicer and more comfortable feel. I ordered an XL as I am in between a Size 10-12 in pants. The pants themselves are snug where it feels more like yoga pants or leggings than pants I can actually wear to work. The pocket linings are completely visible through the fabric. Not great for women who carry a lot of their weight in their bellies as the waist band cuts in the middle so it‚Äôs not very flattering. I‚Äôll keep them but they‚Äôll just be another pair of leggings with pockets.
3.0,"Slipped it on, zipped it up, and then couldn't get the zipper all the way down again, as the fabric snagged. For a hot moment I thought I had met my new lifelong companion. I managed to work my way out of it, over my head. Tugging at the zipper, I finally got it to unzip completely. On a second try, again the zipper snagged, but again I was able to work it all the way down. This is a nice sweater - soft, attractive and roomy. I usually wear XL, but I ordered XXL, because I am 6'5"", and I wanted to be sure it would be long enough in the sleeves and body. It is. The workmanship seems quite good (except maybe the zipper). I will wear it comfortably, while remembering not to zip it."
3.0,One of these broke on the second use. Not sturdy at all.
3.0,"es una bonita blusa pero muy peque√±a, las tallas est√°n  por debajo por completo"
3.0,"Nice, for inexpensive."
3.0,"Super cute earrings. The only problem I had was that they unscrew on the front and back, which caused them to loosen from my granddaughter's ears, without my knowledge and were lost on the FIRST day she wore them!"
3.0,"I gave the bag three stars because I love the color. Orange is my favorite color. If it wasn't orange, I would have definitely returned it.This bag is not a travel bag. This bag is so small, I use it to take food to work and snacks to my son's bowling tournaments. I would have never paid $35 for this bag inside a store. I am very disappointed with the size of this bag."
3.0,"super cute but seriously skin tight, make sure to order up probably two sizes"
3.0,Kid won‚Äôt wear the beard to itchy
3.0,So we love the bathing suit but a little to high in the front for a girls bathing suit. If we go somewhere out at beach she has to wear shorts.
3.0,The problem is the quality. It Is just not worth the money being asked. This is like a $15 hat and it is overpriced. The cat on mine is kinda crooked and one of the cats paws is to far out. So kinda disappointed in this purchase.
3.0,"Nice ring.  Weight wise, it's lighter than an all tungsten ring, which for me are too heavy.  So that was good.  It wasn't quite as shiny as it looks in the pictures.  I have another cobalt ring that has the brushed look in the center, but is still smooth, reflective and bright.  This was a little more course and reminded me of a stainless steel look.  It might be a good option, if that's the look you're going for.  I would have been more tempted to keep it if the fit was right.  I ordered an 8.5 and it fit just like the other cobalt ring, which was a 9 and a little too loose."
3.0,"I read some reviews that said men wore this mask so I got it for my husband. Neither of us liked it for him, not masculine enough. This would be a great mask for a woman if you're not claustrophobic. I tried it on and it made my face a bit sweaty. I prefer the laser cut metal masks myself. All in all, I would say that this mask if definitely more for a woman than a man."
3.0,Fit sort of funny.
3.0,"the tab that pulls out credit cards, but still works"
3.0,Not sure if I missed but not a real wrap and didn‚Äôt hang write on me so sent it back.
3.0,"They cause my ears to hurt, so I gave them away to others."
3.0,Didn't have a drawstring as advertised.  I returned it.
3.0,Used these on my Cafe Lights to hang them in my yard. Right out the box a few started failing. I ordered extras for this reason.
3.0,Pro.<br />The material it is good quality.<br /><br />Cons.<br />Wrists side at the watch side is not as specter. See picture(it is smaller).<br /><br />After 6 months of usage (indoor and outdoor) no big complains so far.
3.0,These weren't as attractive as I had hoped they would be.  They have a weird thickness around the nose of the frame.  They also split over the left eye not long after I received them.  It wasn't really worth the money.  I wouldn't buy them again.
3.0,This might be useful in very cold locations. It was too hot for a South Texas winter. The sunlight gets converted to IR and that IR bakes your head. It will protect you from sunburn but you might get heat stroke in the bargain.
3.0,Great color and material but it's too small.
3.0,He didn't like the color.
3.0,Great product but it gets twisted.
3.0,Looks good but the material is not soft. Some of the button slits weren't stitched well and have thread there that catches onto the button when you try to unbutton.
3.0,Charms are cute but bracelet runs very small.
3.0,"Look fine, but upon removal, causes a &#34;unibrow&#34; line across the top."
3.0,Little long. Needs a tie clip.
3.0,"This is a lovely dress but had to return since the small was too large, and too long, for my frame. I'm 5'3, 115 lbs and the dress fell three inches below the knee. It's a good quality dress for a taller woman."
3.0,Very pretty. Nicely made. But too small returning.
3.0,Cute scarf for a china made product.  Just wish it was a made in America product.
3.0,"I got size M in white and returned it right away.<br />But I can't put less than 3 stars bcs there's nothing technically wrong with it, it's just meant for a different shape than advertized, that's for sure.<br /><br />If you're buying this, keep in mind that this is most certainly a bodycon dress that surprisingly, doesn't have much stretch. So if you have curves, mainly a butt, or are hoping to camouflage a tummy with those skirt folds, it won't acomodate those needs. It is Extremely tight on the bottom part and it doesn't stretch. And I'm 5'4"", and a solid size M. The sleeves are already pretty wide, which rules out going a size up.<br />Also, the *white dress did not pass for a classy cocktail dress bcs it's almost see-through, it's a very sheer, a very ...thin quality velvet, like lingerie. So definitely Not work, family or neighbor party friendly, nightclub - maybe."
3.0,"I'm a size 18/20 female who is just shy of 5&#34;6 and the 2xl fit snugly. I'm a swim instructor that's in 85 degree water approx. 20 hours a week and these are a real life saver. While putting them on  requires the wet-suit song and dance, it is definitely worth it. Not only do these keep me warm in the water, they do a great job of keeping me warm during clean up out of the pool. I am so thankful to get these right before the winter season. I'd previously been wearing swim leggings made out of your standard swimsuit material and while they helped to keep me warm, they are nothing compared insulation power of these bad boys. The smell is quite strong as other reviews have mentioned. I've worn and washed them 5 times already and they still are odorous. However, once in the pool, it is unnoticeable. I'm thrilled because these are $8.00 cheaper (With the free shipping) than what I'd been paying previously and I'm confident these will last longer than the 4/5 month lifespan of my previous suits.<br />I will update again when and if they wear out.<br /><br />*Edit Update* changing from 5 star to 3 star.<br />So it's been about 2 months of having these which for me is 32 times wearing and the lining is tearing. Please make note that I am terrible on suits. Due to the fact I'm in the water on consecutive days, I have to dry the suit in the dryer. These are impossible to get on wet. That being said, the first thing to wear our was the waist band after about one month of use. The neoprene part in still intact and un-faded but the knee lining, the side lining, and crotch lining are all giving out/tearing.<br />If you are wearing this suit sporadically and can give it the time to line dry (several days due to thickness), these would probably last much longer however for me, regular swimsuit leggings though not as warm, last twice as long."
3.0,This 2XL is not that much larger than what I think of XL - but that's what I expected. The material is not as wrinkle free as one would expect from polyester even when washed delicate and dried on a hanger. The body odor management is not much to speak off... but that's what you get for that price.
3.0,"This boots are super cute, my daughter loved the style and how comfy they are but after wearing them for a week the heel got separated from the boot itself :("
3.0,Don‚Äôt fitted me
3.0,I was expecting full set but it showed up with top only no pants.
3.0,It appears to be antique silver. Not as bright as the other charms I purchased. Nice quality. I wish I had know that it was more antique.
3.0,20% of the fingers doesn't work
3.0,should of got an XL. the lg is too tight.
3.0,"Beautiful pieces arrived with missing stones  , but the style is pretty."
3.0,Not able to wear with out an additional slip as skirt is completely sheer and provided slip provides minimal coverage.
3.0,"If you love anime, you would like these masks. They are extremely big so if you have bigger cheeks or a bigger face, go for it."
3.0,they switched to mesh which I don't like but hey cant beat the price and they hold up just like other cloth diapers
3.0,"This is a really cute Disco dancer Halloween outfit. I chose the ""Blue"" color. I like the swirly pattern, the vibrant colors and all its sparkles. However, I wish I could say the same thing about its fit. For one thing it runs small. I ordered the ""Small"" size which is what I normally take (I'm five feet tall and weight 102 lbs). The dress doesn't fit me well at all. It's too tight around my waist, the sleeves are too long and so is the length. Now, I realize that it wasn't going to look as short on me as it does on the model online since I'm five feet tall, but I didn't expect it to go all the way to my knees, it's supposed to be a mini dress! Also, there's a little bit extra material on one side of the dress that goes all the way down to the hem and it sticks out. It came with a long headband of the same material."
3.0,"All in all, this is a decent legging.  I would have to agree with other reviewers that these are definitely sized on the big side.  I got the Teal Space Dye in a size L.  These fit well around my thighs and butt, yet very large in the waist and a little baggy in the crotch.<br /><br />For the record, I'm an hourglass shape with pretty generous thighs and a large muscular bottom.  I'm 5'6&quot; and my measurements are 43-34-46.  I had trouble with the waistband slipping just walking around my neighborhood and in Yoga.  Lounging around the house or going out wasn't a problem.  I did get compliments and think the color and pattern is pretty.  The material is thin, light, soft, smooth and doesn't bind.  Construction is good with a triangle gusset and  flatlock stitching, so there is little chance of ripping or chafing.  The rise is high.<br /><br />Depending on what you're looking for...<br /><br />These pants are good for:<br />- Those who like a looser, no compression fit.<br />- Prefers lighter or thinner fabric (nice for hot weather or someone who hates getting hot while working out).<br />- Those who have a straight to apple shape.<br />-  A person who likes a lot of coverage, wants a higher waist, or taller.<br /><br />These ARE NOT good for:<br />- A person looking for a thicker legging or needing something for cooler weather (unless layering underneath other clothes.)<br />- Are looking for compression or snug fit.<br />- Pear or hourglass figures.<br />- Someone who likes a low rise legging or is petite.<br /><br />Not sure if I would get another pair of these.  I like the quality, look, price but don't like the fit.  I may try getting a Medium to get it to fit better in the waist, but it may get tight in the legs and booty and become too see-through."
3.0,"These were just a little too small for many phone cords, which made them hard to snap. They are good for thinner cords, but not for longer, thicker phone cords. I would buy a bigger size."
3.0,"Bought this so that my husband could play dress up with our son. It is very thin and the print was a little blurry, but it worked out good for what we needed it for."
3.0,Not bad for the price. It looked a little less classy than I had hoped.
3.0,I love this bracelet tho I did have a few problems with it. First my wrist is not big enough for it to wrap around 5x but too big to wrap 4x times so I had to cut it to size and secondly one side of the anchor kept getting caught on things and eventually bent and broke but it is still wearable and the look and message is awesome.
3.0,The quality was not as expected
3.0,"Thres stars for fit, very comfortable... will draw up when washed... needed a size or two smaller.. but it's so soft will do nice with leggings"
3.0,"Look is great can fit HP EliteBook 8470p (fairly bulky laptop 15 inch), but very snug.  I can only fit my thin portfolio and the laptop into bag. Perfect for smaller laptops and tablets.  Can function as a purse.  Ideal for consolidation of electronics for carry-on on flight."
3.0,"I did hand wash this but them the pull strings came clean out and I can't get it back in. Of course this happened right before the return window but I've been trying to get the damn string in. I do like more than I thought and so I ordered another one. Worth $13? Sure. Worth Double That? NO, but , that's life. I can't promise low air dry won't rip it."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:d170e710736b9d1382e22d30eb04a957]] It does not hold the glasses well. I have Rudy project sunglasses and it does not snuggle the sunglasses handel.
3.0,I love the concept. The sheer outer hooded part is amazing. But the dress is very tight and runs quite small.
3.0,Not really comfortable. I was expecting them to be super comfy and they just aren‚Äôt. The top of the slide rubs the side of my feet.
3.0,Material is paper thin and dress runs small.
3.0,"Made for ladies with thinner calves.  Quality is great for the price, but is not forgiving if one's legs are not long and on the thinner side."
3.0,"The watch is beautiful, but after just 1 time wearing it the band has started to peel."
3.0,"I purchased this bag because, when fully packed, it is compact and shaped in the form of a rectangular prism, with no space wasted on curved edges which are found in many other duffels.  According to the manufacturer's literature that accompanied the bag, the inside area measures 2686 cubic inches, making this bag about 50% larger than the typical 20 inch duffel I found on the market when I did my pre-purchase research.  Actually, the bag's dimensions are 21.3"" X 12.8"" X 12.4"" and it weighs three pounds and one ounce when empty.  The bag should easily fit in the overhead bins of most aircraft.<br /><br />My bag has a black nylon exterior and a maroon lining inside all compartments.  It was manufactured in China, but appears to be well made.  The bag comes with a ""10 Years Quality Guarantee,"" whatever that means.  There is a somewhat flexible board inside the lining at the bottom of the center compartment, which helps the bag maintain its rectangular shape when fully packed.  When the bag is not in use, it may be folded flat and stored, taking up little space.<br /><br />One of the carrying handles is shorter than the other, which enables me to carry the bag close to my body while keeping my arm extended down in a relatively straight position.  The shoulder strap is well padded.  Inside the main compartment, there is a zippered sub-compartment running the length of each long side, a third zippered compartment at one end and a pouch without a zipper at the other end.  The photos above show shoes packed in one of the zippered side compartments.  I usually pack shoes in a plastic or cloth bag and have no use for any of the interior pockets.<br /><br />There are also exterior zippered pockets along both of the long sides and another at one end.  On one side, the pocket has a single pull zipper and on the other, a zipper with two pulls.  Inside the two pull zipper compartment are yet further sub-compartments - a smaller zipper compartment with a sewn in spring locking hook presumably to hold keys, a larger compartment without a zipper, and a smaller compartment without a zipper and divided into three sections, presumably to store things such as travel documents, a cell phone, and the like.  The side compartments are large enough to hold a book and a document file, but not a 15.6"" laptop.  The end outside compartment also has a zipper and will hold an object the size of a CD case.<br /><br />I find the inside and most of the outside compartments to be overkill - compartments which are unnecessary and I will never use.  Unfortunately, they take up space that could have been devoted to making a larger center compartment.<br /><br />There are two other problems with this bag.  First, the bag has no outside sleeve or strap that can slip over the handle of a rollerboard.  This would have made transporting this bag and a rollerboard together much easier.  Second, the zipper of the main compartment extends in a straight line down the center of the top of the bag.  Many other duffels on the market today have ""U"" shaped zippered flaps on the top, which should make packing and unpacking easier than the straight line zipper configuration in this Case Logic duffel.<br /><br />In summary, this bag holds a lot considering that it is only a 20 inch duffel.  However, it would have been much better if Case Logic had invested its manufacturing efforts in providing a rollerboard strap and U shaped top flap, instead of furnishing an excessive number of useless zippered compartments."
3.0,not high quality
3.0,"I have previously bought the 0g size and loved them. No issues. Bought a new set at 00g and one of them was chipped through the middle and was completely unwearable. After further inspection i noticed that i received gauges at different widths and lengths. Not that the lengths necessarily matter, but the widths should. The lighter color one looks two sizes smaller? The wood ones have paint on them that easily comes off. As in by the time they made it to my house the paint was stripping and one was even chipped. I also received a singular white gauge, not one to match it. When comparing them to my other 00g‚Äôs they do appear to be a little smaller and the widths are all over the place. However, with that being said, the styles of them are super pretty and affordable. I don‚Äôt remember this many issues when getting the smaller size previously, so maybe it is a hit or miss."
3.0,Made out of odd material will not be wearing.
3.0,Delivered on time<br />Item was to small
3.0,Too small to fit my average sized son's head
3.0,"i have a biggish head. i wear a 7 3/8 baseball cap, it was a little too small"
3.0,"The dress looked great when it arrived. However after my daughter worn it for the first ballet class, I noticed two tag holes in the back. See pictures attached. Not sure if its quality related or just bad luck. Disappointed"
3.0,"By the time it was warm enough to wear these, my son went through a huge growth spurt and couldn't fit in them anymore. I think his feet were hot in them though, with all the leather. They were super cute and supportive, though."
3.0,Bought another pair of jeans from this company described differently and ended up with 2 of the same pairs.  Not fond of denim color.
3.0,"I just wore this mask at work for a prank we pulled that took about an hour.  It definitely has the intended effect of making you look absurd, but it puts a gentle pressure on your eyes the entire time.  After a little while it starts to get annoying.  The material doesn't breathe either, but that's normal.  Just keep in mind if you want to wear this out all night that you'll be pulling it up and rubbing your face every 5-10 minutes after a half hour."
3.0,Love this jacket it is surprisingly warm and looks expensive! Know that it is supposed to be more open in the front. My only thing is the color is more pinkish than it looks in the photo
3.0,Not what I have used before
3.0,Returning to small
3.0,"Ordered by mistake.  Meant to order a medium and it was too late to cancel, so I reordered and returned this one unopened."
3.0,"This is my second time trying to get the right laces fron the same brand. I am trying to get a laceez for my daughters shoes that are 2.5 kids size (hightop vans), my first time was on walmart I bought the size L according to the sugestion in the description of the product and was extremely small that they barely reached the 3rd hole row so I came on amazon and bought this pair Woman size 5 to 6.5 and are still small I think I will need a size W3 or M (to sizes more) to find the perfect fit for my daughter shoes. Which mean you need to buy 3 or 4 sizes bigger than sizes they suggest.<br /><br />I gave 3 stars because the look good and high quality but we havent been able to really use them yet."
3.0,"OMG  the material feels like a wet suit!  Hate the spandex, I will give it away."
3.0,No stretch under the underarms trying to put it on.. just no stretch with it..
3.0,"Nice, decent quality for less than you will pay at the park."
3.0,Its not as nice.
3.0,"I ordered this bra in the size cup D and it was way too small. The &#34;D cup&#34; size would only work for women with an A or B cup. Also, the edges and material of the bra was rough."
3.0,"Super cute but unfortunately way too big for my wrist.  I thought I could make it work but it just looks sloppy because of how big it is.  It's too bad, because it's super pretty and I will be returning it."
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  Just from eyeing it, seems to be roomy but not too,too large for size."
3.0,"Beautiful pattern and light flowy dress, perfect for summer.<br />Slightly long, needed to hem the front (more than back) and I am 5'2''.<br />Fabric slightly see-through, I bought a long white slip for underneath."
3.0,I‚Äôm a 38 DD and the xxl was too small :( Bummer
3.0,"Great liners, exactly what I was looking for as far as how they fit. The light tan liners were a little slippery on the shoe the first time being worn, so my foot slid in my flats quite a bit. Also another problem with the light tan liners after washing them, the plastic on the heel that‚Äôs supposed to make the liner hold onto your foot, wasn‚Äôt as effective as the first time so the liner slips off my foot every now and then. The black liners were fine before/after wash."
3.0,"Cute gloves, but too big and baggy for my three year old daughters hands."
3.0,Extra small is NOT extra small in their sizing structure.  I would order probably order a youth medium or small in the future.
3.0,Nice color and soft. Definitely order at least one size larger than you usually wear. I usually wear small ordered a medium and it barely fits.
3.0,The buckle is smaller than an old iPhone 4 or a deck of cards. So small I don't think my friends really noticed it. I think they could have a hit on their hands if they doubled their size. And from a quality stand point my label was cut crooked and placed on the buckle. Like rotated 15-20 degrees.
3.0,Love the print!  Material looks kinda shiny and cheap. Fit was a little big. I ordered a small (my measurements 35-29-37).
3.0,"Fabric is very cute but style of the dress isn't my style, bottom of dress is wide/swing and knee length."
3.0,"good fabric, looks very nice, but the size runs at least 1 size too large.( and I am a big woman) it costs too much to return , so I will try sewing them smaller."
3.0,Cute dress for work but faded/pilled quickly in the washer.
3.0,Love love love the top half of the dress. the bottom fits snug but I have a big derriere so it's not the designer;s fault.
3.0,"Smaller than expected, cheap material, material is rough not soft. Sent it back."
3.0,Bought this for my son. He has a interview coming up and he needed a new belt. The belt states it's a size 46&#34; and he wears a size 42&#34; normally. This belt was way too small. Nice craftsmanship though.
3.0,Overall good quality but one of it was slightly damaged.
3.0,It is a lovely watch but I had to return it as I thought it had a greenish tinge to it in the picture (that's what attracted me to it). It was also quite heavy and too large for me.
3.0,Worked great until the 1st time we tried to clean them then they died. Complete waste of money To try in return. They got you. Bought a less expensive pair afterwards and they're still rockin hot 6 months later
3.0,While I find this top to be really cute the sizing is way off.  I am usually a small and ordered a medium but it fits like an  extra extra small.  So order 2 sizes up cause the company won't pay for your return shipping!
3.0,I wanted this for my dad's funeral<br />Because i wasn't in a mood to go to the stores.it arrived very fast but it was way to small and i bought an XL i give it to my sister she is a petite small and the fit for her was great. The material was really nice even my sister loved it.
3.0,"I love the design and idea of this dress, it just didn't work for me. You can't wear a bra with it, the strap will show in the back. The material is nice quality but that's what made it droop on me. The front part weighed down the top and so it wasn't form fitting. Super comfy and cute but no go."
3.0,"The vinyl pieces are cheap looking and the angled front flap zipper is different but makes that area useless except for smaller items like pens and dry erase markers. The bag itself it not quite stiff enough. It flops around as you try to load or unload it and I'm tempted to put a piece of cardboard in it to stiffen it. These are not really reasons not to buy it given the price, just be informed as to what you will be getting."
3.0,"It's a nice bag, but I should have read the product description better. It's way too small for me. Unfortunately I cannot return it because it will cost too much to do so. Sigh!"
3.0,It doesn‚Äôt fit- really liked the style but disappointing that it didn‚Äôt fit
3.0,this dress is a bit longer than my usual style and although the dress is ok with regards to style it looked much better online than in person.
3.0,"Over the shirt looks exactly as advertised. However, the material of the shirt feels like a raincoat."
3.0,"I LOVE these leggings, however I stand about 5'9&#34; & these are not for tall people. They're very thick & soft, just wish they were a bit longer and the waist was a bit higher. The pattern is absolutely darling as well. Not sure if I would order again."
3.0,"The fabric is fine. The color is fine. It's a good value. But the cut is too short and boxy. Granted, I'm far from rail thin and carry more weight in my hips and thighs. I'll still wear this at home as a bedroom coverup but it's not flattering for me to wear with jeans and a t-shirt."
3.0,"It's not bad, haven't washed it yet.  I expected something different, but it's VERY light flannel.  I kept it."
3.0,If fit prefect just the silver was see through
3.0,i would not recommend
3.0,Fit was good.  Comfortable.  Had a funny chemical smell.  But after washing was better.  I like that they fit so the length can be adjusted.
3.0,Nice material but it's a tight fit for cards and cash me it could have been a little bit bigger for items
3.0,Granddaughter really likes it!
3.0,Did not like how the trim had waves in it... did not lay flat.
3.0,"These fit as expected, look like picture, and were decently comfortable to wear all day."
3.0,"Feels Like Nothing On, Very Light"
3.0,quality could be better
3.0,Bought for my grandson and the colors didn‚Äôt work for him so we returned them.
3.0,"This is pretty, but the color is a bit off and one of the parts is missing a gem. The missing component wasn't loose in the package, otherwise I would have glued it back on and been fine with it (so it was shipped broken?)<br />A bit disappointed, but I can take it apart and fix it with other components, so not a total loss."
3.0,I like the design but the material could be better
3.0,"Great looking shoes and quite confortable. Got a 2nd pair since I loved my 1st one so much BUT to my surprise, it came with the same problem. The zipper opens up while wearing them, it becomes quite annoying. Cheap zipper for a $70 shoe. I got my 1st pair fixed (paid extra) thinking that perhaps might have been a fluke but when receiving 2nd pair with the same issue, its a product problem."
3.0,"I wear normally a 3X, bought a 5X, and could not get into the dress."
3.0,"It hits about 2 inches below the knee, I got a large and I‚Äôm 5‚Äù6"
3.0,"I was sent 2 pairs of heather gray instead of one gray & one black. Also the only reason I bought was because I love the 90 degree brand, only 1 pair was actually 90 degree brand ."
3.0,very pretty but do not go 2 size up. maybe one size up.
3.0,You can't use your finger when you wear this.. it bulges up at the knuckle.. quality is ok/good.. had to return
3.0,"I had to get a pair of pliers and squeeze the clasps tighter because they didn't even touch when I got it and it flopped open and closed whenever I moved. It has a nice weight to it that I wasn't expecting but the color on the clasp has worn off and I haven't had it that long, I'm not exactly gentle with it but it showed signs of wear after a week or so. For the price I'm not too surprised or upset about that though."
3.0,"Very cute design the side straps are a lil weird on me but I think is because I needed a larger size, otherwise very cute swimsuit super sexy for a one piece."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:b9868c1c7f50824dc31af0c05558c2b5]] Two different sizes on capris.
3.0,Cute top but after hand washing it the letters started to become discolored. Not good quality. Fabric has a weird smell to it.
3.0,Nice gloves.  Box arrived totally trashed.  The cloves are nice but small and long.  So for my teams they are not as I hoped since the fingers are pretty long.
3.0,"I have purchased several of these tank dresses over the last couple of months, and they've all been cute and comfortable. I wanted something different from the ones I already have, so chose the sort-of paint-streak/semi-tie-dyed one called ""Multicolored"". Y'all -- eww. It looks blurry, like they blew up a small print of a design they liked and didn't even bother to worry about whether it looked in focus or not. Really pretty ugly. Since I bought it mostly just to wear around the house, I'll keep it (not worth the hassle to return), but believe me, I will NOT be wearing this outside of my home!"
3.0,"This item is very pretty and looks nice when you wear it, but the post is VERY short and was painful for me to wear.  If you need the post to be a little bit longer, this is not for you.  Otherwise, it is nice."
3.0,"Very pretty, but not quite 1inch. I would say they are lore 24mm than 25mm. They dont fall out that easy, but I if i slept in them, I'm sure I'd find them in my bed somewhere"
3.0,The shirt is good quality and really cute but it‚Äôs way too big. I ordered a medium thinking it was a kids medium but it‚Äôs clearly an adult size. It shouldn‚Äôt be listed as a ‚Äúboy‚Äôs shirt‚Äù.
3.0,Kind of hokey looking.
3.0,Great quality shirt!  Order 1 to 2 sizes down if you want it to fit like a t-shirt.  I ended up wearing up as a long oversized tee for bed.
3.0,"The bag is well made for the price I paid. I like the zipper opening in the back. The handle on the top can be better made, I'm afraid it may not last. The little puffy keychain is a good idea for a nice touch, but only cute for a little kid, it makes the bag looks cheap. I wish I bought the larger size with two zipper pockets on either sides. On the fence for return, but will keep it for a try."
3.0,"Conveniently holds my eyeglasses & sunglasses.<br />I DID have to return the first one I ordered, for not having all the protective lining glued in.<br /><br />It would be nicer if a bit taller -- but so far serves my purpose well."
3.0,"It is fine, but really quite skimpy. I ended up returning it. The fit was also a bit weird. Very short, but sort of loose at the same time."
3.0,"Way small, but an attractive shirt."
3.0,"its ok, working pretty fine, but broke after using for half year. the rubber strape break, also the plastic ring broken into two piece.<br />thats what you get for how much you pay for."
3.0,"Don't put in dryer, bought it for my husband and after washing and drying it shrank so it's my shirt now"
3.0,"After only one day, they broke. I fixed them and now they work great.."
3.0,They look very pretty but they tarnished with a week
3.0,I bought this because of all the reviews raving about how soft it is. I don't think it's very soft at all. And it's a bit short. But it is pretty
3.0,"Bikini band fit fine, cups were way too small. Less than 1/2 my breast fit. Not really supporting of the lady bits at all."
3.0,The earrings were to long for me.  Returned.  Pretty though.
3.0,"When I took it out of the bag, it was already &#34;broken&#34; you can say. Where the clasp meets the piece of metal that is attached to the first pearl it wasn't properly made/put together. There was a little gap where it didn't make a full circle to connect to the end of the clasp. But I mean, for the price I cant complain, I just need it for a vintage photos hoot so for a one time wear... no big deal."
3.0,I like the look of it!!!
3.0,"It works amazingly well, your shirt will never come untucked. However, one clasp did come undone once and that was a real pain. It's also ridiculously uncomfortable to wear and pulled at my leg hair"
3.0,"I love the low weight and clarity but... The lenses have a mirror tinting on the inside of the lens and reflects any light source flanking you, becoming quite distracting.  Why are the lenses tinted on the interior?  I thought maybe it was a plastic protective cover at first.  :("
3.0,Very nice material. It is a bit larger than advertised. I hope it will shrink a little in the wash to compensate
3.0,Got ruined after the first wash
3.0,"Looks great, fit well in toe area.wide enough for my bunion. But gave me blisters after walking for 5min. Recommend cushion inserts."
3.0,"This dress looks so pretty online; however, it does not look good on me."
3.0,The suit is beautiful and the top is very comfortable. The top has very good front coverage so you don't show anything when you are bending over. I just wish the shorts weren't so low rise. This is a plus size suit - that usually means there's a little bit of belly that needs to be tucked in. It would be nice if the waist band came up a little higher. Still gets the job done.
3.0,light and packable
3.0,Dislike how fast it stretched out to where its always needing to be pulled up to keep nose covered
3.0,"Is pretty lackluster.<br />The diamonds and amethyst don‚Äôt sparkle at all.<br />Even though it lacks the sparkle I want, it is still pretty for costume jewelry."
3.0,"Colors are not as pictured. The large stones are actually jade green and the slender ones are a light turquoise.  It's okay but it's definitely disappointing, especially given the cost."
3.0,"Fit and style were good, however the plastic is somewhat transparent and thin. I expected to use these boots for many rainy/muddy days and out on a farm, so I returned because I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd hold up for very long."
3.0,The posts and backing are cheaply made. Not happy with them but will keep them as the stones are pretty. But the posts bend easy
3.0,I love charm bracelets. I wish this were real.Been looking for a real one like this.Sigh
3.0,Packing wrinkles almost impossible to remove. After 3 washings it was ok
3.0,Super itchy on the inside.
3.0,"These are comfortable for my treadmill walks but the pocket is useless.  My phone doesn‚Äôt come close to fitting in the pocket shown in the picture, which was the main reason for me selecting these shorts.  The fit was fine though."
3.0,"Looks great, the clasp don't clip well to collars or stay in place"
3.0,I was somewhat disappointed. The picture in front is not where near as vivid. Otherwise it is a nice bag.
3.0,"This showed up with bleach stains on it, and looked used. I sent it back the next day."
3.0,"This is a great jacket. It looks great and doesn‚Äôt feel too hot or plasticy like some rain jackets do. Haven‚Äôt been out in the rain with it to test, but it seems like it would do well. I love the inside pull cords that give it a little bit of shape; that‚Äôs a rare thing in rain coats. For the price, definitely worth it.<br /><br />Edit 7/13: I walked outside while it was raining pretty hard to bring some stuff inside, and when I took it off, my shoulders were a little damp. I was out in the rain for less than a minute. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine in a light rain but I wouldn‚Äôt trust it in a downpour."
3.0,Do not care for the spandex type material the shirt is made out of and it ran smaller than what I expected.
3.0,Beautiful and well-made but it runs small. I would suggest sizing up.
3.0,Cute for my sons baby shark onesie he wore for halloween this year.  The fit is a little funny.  The boots/slippers really have no support in them.
3.0,"It's beautiful, but the straps are too wide for me, even when adjusted to the smallest size. For reference, I wear a women's size Medium - so this will probably be too wide for a lot of ladies!"
3.0,"These are cute, but some of them are gold not the rose gold color.  The Clasp are hard to snap in ear as well."
3.0,I didn't like the fact that part of the gold inside was hanging out.
3.0,Nicely made and fits well but the fabric quickly pills up.
3.0,"Reasonably priced, it works! The only problem is that you have to manually change the rotation direction. I don't understand why they wouldn't have it rotate in alternate directions rather than you having to change it on the switch. That would be a simple change on the circuit board."
3.0,"They are okay. Not terrible.  I am 5'5&#34;, 135 pounds with a long torso and I ordered a medium."
3.0,looks good. chain is too thin.
3.0,comfortable for work
3.0,Very cute but did not fit my bust.
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5,0 170 bought a size large fits snug but the color I got which is pink is really prettyz"
3.0,"Too small, good quality. Returning."
3.0,"Overall I really liked the dress. The color was great and just as I expected, great fabric and pockets as well. I really wanted to keep this dress but with my pear shaped body it made me look pregnant so it just wasn't a good fit for my body type."
3.0,"Fits great,very comfortable.  True to my size 8. Good value for price."
3.0,"Great, but after several washes it fell apart"
3.0,"Nothing fantastic. The pattern is clear, the clasp is nice, but the leather piece starts to fray after a while."
3.0,"Shirt is great material,great fit but the placement of skeleton hands are too high! About 2-3 inches too high."
3.0,The shirt was ok on material an workmanship. It was to small. I had to buy the larger one.
3.0,"I love the color of this shirt but unfortunately I will have to loose more weight in order to wear it, it is not true to size and I didn‚Äôt see where it said to order a size up"
3.0,"Ordered it in yellow, but it was a peach color instead. Pretty dress though"
3.0,This is a nice looking bracelet.  It doesn't look cheap and the weight and shape are nice.
3.0,"The collar is very cute although very high on the chest, nearly to my neck. I recommend wearing this with high necked sweaters and dresses, unfortunately I only have mid chest length tops. Very comfortable though, would look very cute with high neckline shirts."
3.0,I wear an 8 1/2 & I felt like cinderella's sister! Beautiful shoe but need to buy a size UP!  Took 2 stars for size
3.0,its good but breaks easily
3.0,"Material is like a thick cardigan material, good for fall, winter and early spring.  I Really like this dress but unfortunately this dress is NOT true to size.  I went by the manufacturer size guide and it was way too small.  I am usually a size 8, with big boots, I got the 2xl and it did not fit anywhere."
3.0,"price and quality are not in synch - does not seem very well made with lots of loose threads and no ""finish"""
3.0,The comfort for my son was not really worth the investment. Get one size extra too as well for what you think they wear. But I give it three stars because it was basically as advertised.
3.0,"Did not think it was the best of quality, could have been a bit thicker. You can tell the decal is not that thick, I'm thinking it will wear off sooner than a person would expect, (but that's yet to be seen). It came too large, need to find a better way of sizing. Something like...(Average size for 12-year-old boy) or ask ""what is your height and weight"". Even go as far as figurines to help? Some way we can zoom in on the size we want without knowing the person's size. I'm going to wash it in very hot water and dry it on high heat, maybe that will shrink it a bit? Don't want to hassle with a return."
3.0,You cannot even see the stones hardly it is so tiny
3.0,"Ordering was fast and easy. Shipping was on time, actually earlier. But the size of the shirt was too tight. I ordered an XL shirt. Which should have fit perfectly... but the shirt I received was in my opinion at most a medium."
3.0,"Poor stitching quality, but decent fabric. I'm a size 10 - 12 and it fit fine, a tad tight in the sleeves. I'm only 5ft and it was the perfect length for me, so I imagine a tall person may be wearing a miniskirt!"
3.0,"The boots aren't bad. They are comfortable. and cute. The only thing I don't like about them is that the top is very wide. I like a snug fitting boot. If your walking in snow your boot will definitely get snow inside. basically, The snow will get packed in the inside."
3.0,These were worn by my 7 year old almost daily. They lasted 7 months (Aug-March) and now have cracking on the top and have worn a small hole in the sole. We have had boots worn just as frequently and hold up better.
3.0,The little pocket for a key is pretty tiny. Really comfortable shorts with a nice high waist. Wish it had side pockets though.
3.0,It‚Äôs not what I expected.
3.0,"I was expecting this jacket to be a bit thicker, so when I put it on and felt how thin it was I was a bit disappointed. Overall, it was cute for the price so I decided to wear it on a warm but a little windy day. It has a perfect length especially for small torsos. The only thing I didn't like is the that it shedded this white cotton in the inside all over my black dress :("
3.0,Very pretty but the clasp is good at all.<br />I sent back but will order again to see if the clasp is better
3.0,"Thick, warm and comfortable, but peels quickly."
3.0,"good quality shoe and good price- unfortunately it was not a wide width as stated- too narrow, gave them away"
3.0,Based on the description I was not expecting the fabric to be shiny and satin like. I think it's a pretty dress and fits well but because of the fabric it's not what I expected. The pictures show now sheen whatsoever.
3.0,"The mask was good for about an hour of wear. I might have a larger head howeve the amount of tension that the elastic bands exerted on the mask pushed the metal nose piece into my face. It‚Äôd be fine but the nose piece is a flat strip, and has an edge. So even with the layer or two of fabric between my nose and the wire, I literally couldn‚Äôt keep wearing the mask due to the pain and had to switch to a different mask. I ended up replacing the nose wire with garden wire, and replaced the elastic band with cloth head ties. After the modifications it‚Äôs a great mask... fits and seals well and I can talk in it without my mouth constantly brushing the inside of the mask. Just wish they had done the work that I had to especially at this price..."
3.0,"Fits well, but too heavy and the tongue too large that hurt my ankle....I dislike it.....I try once. But no more....Converse-all Stars is excellent to play basketball....sorry ."
3.0,"Keeps a lot of light out, but not better than one I use I got free on a long flight.<br /><br />It's really hot to wear, too."
3.0,"Lost my beanie awhile back, was looking to find a new beanie.  It is a little tight, but after a couple weeks of wearing it.  It gotten a little looser.  For the price, why not try it out.  I was not that satisfied with it but as a back up ok why not...."
3.0,"The leggings themselves are a nice fit and havegood high waisted support. The reason I rated them lower, and needed up returning is because the color was completely off from the picture. I ordered the pink, which based off the picture I assumed would be a fun bubble gum type pink, instead they came as sort of a reddish orange which left me disappointed."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt like the material really thin but still kinda cute just wasn‚Äôt for me
3.0,Doesnt look like picture at all
3.0,I was bummed that only 3 of the 5 worked.
3.0,"The color and the nonna charm were a little cheaply made, the charms came on 2 different bracelets instead of one.Not really satisfied, but I still kept it."
3.0,"Love the colors and quality, but these socks are huge on my toddler and fall down immediately. They are way too large and she probably won‚Äôt be able to wear them until next year."
3.0,"Jacket fits just fine.  Looks just like the photo.  The waistband is rather loose, but some people may prefer it that way.  The thing that disappointed me most is. . . . . . where are the pockets????!!!!!  Big deal breaker for me - what's a bomber jacket without the pockets?  Since most of us expect this type of jacket to automatically come with pockets,  the seller needs to stress the fact that this one doesn't."
3.0,"yo me confundi, pense que me llegarian de diferentes colores. pero me gusto que se adapta a cualquier talla"
3.0,The door on it already broke and it's always stopping and needing to be rewound up.  I would not get this again.
3.0,"Ok. Nothing great, but cannot complain much."
3.0,Difficult to take off and put on.
3.0,"I received the package and the charms were in good condition, but the 20 piece set was incomplete"
3.0,"keeps sliding off my nose, and I have pretty high nose bridge, dk y."
3.0,I needed a case for my reading glasses.  this one is too large
3.0,This is not as shiny as it appears in the picture and is really more of a guy thing.  Wag bigger than it appears also.
3.0,It isnt the bright vibrant yellow shown in the picture.. it's more of a mustard yellow. Material is super thick and not breathable..
3.0,"Cute, durable, but very tight on adults."
3.0,You get what you pay for that‚Äôs for sure. Battery wore out in 2 weeks
3.0,"Very nice but have scuffs, I'm returning them."
3.0,"Very delicate, but worth the price!"
3.0,Totally disappointed.  Got three for my sister trip we do every year and it was not what I expected.  First the picture shows the two bracelets together but they are loose and slip off and the silver one looks a little tarnished. The inside is nice and legible.
3.0,The shirt is okay.  I am a 20/22 and bought the 2X. The color is good and it has good flow. It is long enough in the back to cover the bum. But I would not buy this in any other colors. The material is very thin and somewhat clingy. Definitely have to wear with a tank underneath. And the area around the collar with the mesh is unevenly cut/sewn so one side has less.
3.0,A little shorter then expected. Makes a good swim cover.
3.0,Cute but very soft metal and will bend easily.
3.0,Very little filling. It‚Äôs not warm enough to be called a snowsuit.
3.0,This little wallet is good for what I needed it for.  Just a tiny pouch for my ID and credit cards.
3.0,I like the style. I also love hoops. Just have to love them. Seven six five four three two one.
3.0,Great earrings just a bit heavy.
3.0,All the bests were great and perfect for our two kids to play with. After further examination I noticed the doctor best was printed upside down though. Doesn‚Äôt stop us from playing.
3.0,Just like a cheap rubber ring
3.0,Very cute! But Product is small. I have an average size wrist and it fit tight. Can‚Äôt wear for more than 15 minutes before it starts to be to tight
3.0,Love the color but the dress was so wrinkled when delivered.
3.0,small in chest
3.0,"make sure you order a size bigger than your normal size as they run extremely small, other than that, they are very good quality and I like the fact that they ride high in the armpit area, it makes wearing them as an undershirt very comfortable"
3.0,The suit its self is very pretty in person. The fabric is a little thinner/cheaper than your 40 dollar swim suits but to be expected bc it was only about 17. I wear a medium in all suits. This medium top fit perfect but the bottom fit like a large. It‚Äôs a little saggy and loose in the waist. Worth taking in due to the price. 5‚Äô5‚Äù 140 lbs
3.0,"Returned, didn't like the way the sleeves poofed out"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:ef3a3bba492010d4d751714028b2ab5d]] The crystals are beautiful but they both broke at the tip so be absolutely careful but even tho they are a keeper
3.0,"Dress is really pretty so I will keep it.  However, it will have to be altered.  I am 5'7&#34;, 160 pounds and this dress is HUGE!  It is really too large to be fashionable."
3.0,"Would be a nicer shirt if it fit better...the length is way to long.  For a Nike product, I was very disappointed"
3.0,"The hook that goes in your ear is not made well, it is too thick and unless the hole in your ear is very large.  You will have trouble inserting them.  Though they are beautifully made, they are difficult to put on for this reason.  I would not buy again.  My ear lobes do not like this thickness.  Never in over 40 years have I seen an earring this thick."
3.0,"Great quality pants, they'd be especially awesome for the fall- the material is thick and a bit stiff, but would be perfect if you were stomping through some bushes. That being said, the pants have about 0% stretch- there's elastic on the very bottom of each pant leg, as well as at the top with the drawstring. But that is all the leeway allowed. I'm normally a women's size 0, but I ordered a 1 just in case, and if fit nicely, though a size up would definitely give me more room to move and not feel as stiff. The women's size 1 was a bit tight with the zipper and button, tight enough that there was no reason to have drawstrings or elastic, and my thighs also fit snugly. I'd have to go a size up if I planned to eat a meal while wearing the pant, they really will not expand enough to accommodate that.  They look like great pants, but just know they don't stretch and don't move with you. Also, the pockets are great! The normal hand pockets are nice and deep, as are the side pockets. Although, the side pockets are very narrow at the opening, so the pockets can't be used for a lot of things- you'd have to squish things in there. It would be fine to hold a bunch of coins, tissues, some kinds of candy, or gum, but it wouldn't be helpful for a wallet, banana, or really a phone, depending on how bit yours is. Maybe the pants will soften a bit when you wash them, but I'd still get a size bigger, considering I've got a flat bum and the pants were still tight on me."
3.0,It is to look smallllll.....
3.0,"My measurements: 5'6&#34;, 135 lbs, usually a size 8/medium. I got the one-size fits all, non-fleece lined.<br /><br />The Pros: nice compression in the waist area, good price for a set of 2. I am a nursing mama so the high waist also lets me nurse without completely exposing my midsection.<br /><br />The cons: I got the unlined but it is still quite thick/unbreatheable. The material is more like thick, footless tights-- slightly shiny. It also snags easily and though some people say it is completely opaque, it isn't when you bend over!<br /><br />The verdict: good to wear under a long top or tunic in winter."
3.0,Packaged great but stretched out
3.0,"They looked super cute but the material is poor quality. The straps started fraying right away, my son only tried them out at home for 30 mins. They are also slippery on wood and tile flooring. I am returning them before even trying them outside."
3.0,I love this brand of leggings but they are small. You have to size way up
3.0,Very cute but also very low cut.
3.0,Overall nice! Definitely warm and waterproof. But they are stiff. Works with phone but not good for texting
3.0,It shrinks a lot. Not good for mens sizes either.
3.0,I was just hoping it was gonna be bigger and I guess there is no left or right.
3.0,"The drawstring fell out completely the first time I washed these pants. They're extremely thin. But they're pretty comfortable as pajamas. I wouldn't order them again, though."
3.0,"I usually wear large or  XL in this type of rockabilly dresses, and after reading the comments, I decided to buy an XX Large. It's still very tight around my chest, and the sleeves. The color is slightly more orange than it looks in the picture. And even though I ordered a white petticoat to wear under it, after trying one of the petticoats at home, I think it's best to wear it without one. Still, it's a pretty dress, I just wish the measurements were more in line with the size."
3.0,Smaller fit... Order bigger size..
3.0,The bag was not thin and always ripped when unfolding. Fabric is stiff.
3.0,broken quality
3.0,"bottoms fit great, top is flimsy made. cute suit but wish top had fit better"
3.0,Hated that string in the front it was unnecessary but other than that is was adorable
3.0,"Lace tears too easily, but these are still really pretty and smooth..but can already tell that they will tear soon"
3.0,Very cute skirt! Comfortable. A bit see through. DO NOT put it in the washer/dryer...the pattern was totally ruined after the first time I washed it.
3.0,"I like the design, and I like the concept of ratcheting belts. This one worked great, right up until the clasp broke about 10 minutes ago. It lasted exactly 11 months. I don't think I wear things over tight or am particularly rough on anything, although I usually wear a belt, so it did get regular use from me. It's tough for me to say what should be an acceptable life. A regular belt of course is mechanically very simple, so the leather tends to give out before the clasp, a process which takes years for me. This is the first time I've had a clasp break before the leather wore out, well the first time I think I've ever had a clasp break. I'll get another ratcheting belt I'm sure, although I will probably look around and see if any other options are considered more durable."
3.0,Use it for casual dressing.
3.0,"It's a nice necklace for the price. Only thing that bothers me a bit is the seam on the circles. I have not worn it yet, so cannot say anything about the quality if worn."
3.0,Is cute and nice but one piece just fall
3.0,This is a great buy however the size I got was too small. I immediately put this I the return bag and sent it back. My only issue now is you never got the product back. This is quite irritating.
3.0,loved the bracelet!!!!!!! just broke after a couple times of wearing gotta try an fix it.
3.0,too thin for me. runs small.
3.0,"I would normally wear an extra large(36DD). I got a 2X because the reviews said they run small. So it fits and the material is thick. There‚Äôs only one problem. NO PADDING. If is was padding like the description said, there would be better support.  I may return these."
3.0,"The belt is attractive and arrived in a cute gift box.  However, I can't figure out how to adjust it.  Will have to ask my husband for help which is always a bummer."
3.0,"Now that this just arrived (great, fast, shipping by the way), I see these are a very cheap feeling plastic and not a thin metal. I read, read, and reread the product page just now and nowhere does it say this will be plastic. It was probably my fault for assuming. So, for plastic this product is &#34;Ok&#34;; I don't know I would have wanted to spend $20 on them had I known. the &#34;feel&#34; of these, (especially the noseguard which holds these together), is less than good: dare I say &#34;cheap&#34;.<br /><br />But lets put this into context. The LOOK nice. An most folks aren't going to know they are plastic from afar, especially if you are going to use them for Cosplay. It's September as I write this and Halloween is upon us. I saw some similar goggles at a &#34;Halloween Store&#34; thicker plastic, but also very cheap LOOKING, just a shoddy paint job, and those were $30. So I shouldn't complain too much. I may add to this after next week and we see how they hold up."
3.0,nice looking but a few inches 2 short. wish it was a tad bit longer.. probably wont buy again for 40 bucks. if you catch it on sale then good luck
3.0,"For ""plus size"" they don't fit too comfortably if you have bigger thighs like I do. They're tight around the thigh and want to roll down."
3.0,Don't like that it doesn't open more. Too hard to us. Bought one at Walmart I like better
3.0,"Nice glasses, but only the dark brown lenses are polarized (although it said they are all polarized, in fact the other color lenses are not), and the lenses are extremely hard to remove and interchange with other lenses of another color."
3.0,The joggers are made of comfortable fabric and doesn't scratch or anything. It doesn't have much stretch to it (basically not stretchy at all) and runs about one size too small. If you're buying this for working out I must say I'm not confident it will withhold deep squats.
3.0,"The shirts are nice and fit as expected but out of the two, new 3 packs of shirts, half of them have stains on them. Small, scattered grey colored stains that I'm hoping will come out in the wash. If these were not going to be worn as undershirts I would have packed them up and sent back. Hoping the stains come out. Otherwise they are nice shirts."
3.0,"Real plain, not flattering."
3.0,"cheap chain strap,but still a cute purse."
3.0,Bought this for a wedding. Thought is was more cotton but this material I think will be cooler .
3.0,"Arms were a bit small, for the size."
3.0,Edited to say i was sent a second one as I only got one at first. They are still a little big but i think i was wearing them wrong at first. They will work and are super cute.<br /><br />Original: Says it comes with a set of 2 but it only came with one. Its also HUGE and does not fit the foot at all and i have size 10 feet. I will be returning
3.0,Cheaply made. Flaps on side cover peripheral view but does keep sun off your face and ears well.
3.0,Very nice bag but smelled like it's been in a fish market
3.0,Fits nice.  I was surprised that there was no front pocket.
3.0,Ordered these for my 2yr old son. He loves them but the colors are a little mixed up. The green light is in the red and the red is in the green. He does not seem to care but the lights are not as bright.  The white and the blue work well though.  They are fun but we were a little dissapointed because the colors were switched in all three sets that we ordered (120 lights total).
3.0,They were cute but the legs were not the same length.
3.0,"I love anything hedgehog so I was super excited to find this necklace.<br />It arrived packaged very nicely, wrapped up safe and secure in bubble wrap with a friendly little &#34;thank you&#34; sticker on the wrapping. It also came with a drawstring fabric storage bag.<br />The hedgehog charm is larger than I was expecting. I thought it would be a dainty little hedgie. Instead he is about the size of a quarter. It is still super cute, with a very cartoon-like little nose. It is very lightweight. The chain is too long for me, placing the hedgehog in a precarious position in relation to my cleavage. I will have to doctor on the chain to make this wearable, as it is not adjustable and the metal is a unique color. The chain feels very flimsy and I would not recommend it for daily wear. It is cute and will compliment playful outfits nicely.<br />I recommend this for the hedgehog enthusiast without a doubt. Great way to show the world your love of hedgies.<br /><br />Disclosure - I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review."
3.0,Unfortunately I will have to return.
3.0,"Too small, too short, good fabric"
3.0,they where smaller then what I thought they was. but nice.
3.0,Slips so you end up continually pulling it up which defeats the purpose of not touching your face. I can see it would be good to use under a motorcycle helmet for warmth though.
3.0,I think they would have worked except that my left foot has a bone that sticks up and the straps were too tight against it.
3.0,"An economical solution, but these are tube socks, not what I expected. I prefer a proper heel."
3.0,"Cute, but the jacket is so small, I bought a large using there size chart & think I needed a 2x. The shorts were fine. My size 2 neices fit the jacket fine."
3.0,This tee was actually thicker than my other CBGB tees. It did not have the stretch the others have either. Unfortunately I had to return but seller was great with the refund. Thank you!
3.0,Nice but don‚Äôt get them wet or near perfume they will turn
3.0,"Followed the advice of other reviewers to size appropriately, the fit wasn‚Äôt the most flattering but my biggest issue was how poorly the skeletons printed. They came out quite blurry, really wish the image would have been clearer. Return was very quick and hassle free though."
3.0,"I thought this looked just ok on me.  I have a &#34;pooch&#34; and it really emphasized that.  My husband was not a fan and my daughter thought it was just ok looking. I wasn't a fan of the material, felt very cardboard-y. It ran small...I am 5'3&#34;, 147lbs and it just fit. If it shrinks in the wash it would be way too small. I plan to return."
3.0,"The dress itself is nice and I love the design.  However, it is a little small in the arm/chest area.  I wasn't able to fully get it on my arms to close the dress.  It's a good price for an outfit.  The material seems to be a cotton/nylon mix and it's stretchy.  If I had gotten a bigger size I think I would have enjoyed this dress. (I am about 150 pounds and normally a size 6/8 in dresses.  I am 36C)"
3.0,Pretty dress but it was pink and not a true rose gold which was disappointing. I ordered a size 14 and the bust was too big so I ended up having to have it altered.
3.0,"Great product but the gold plating wears away very quickly, then the metal begins to corrode."
3.0,"I ordered a large, and the might have worked as a woman's large, not a mans.  They barely covered the palm."
3.0,"catches on every fabric near it, but it comfy, stylist and long lasting. I used plyers to push down the links that poked out, catching the fabric of my clothes. it worked for some time but eventually, even though I could not see/feel any links out of place, it still caught fabric. Not when it catches, I just rotate the fabric in small circles until it comes off (instead of just pulling it and ripping my clothes lol)"
3.0,"Very nice necklace,  but not really worth $20."
3.0,More for an adult not youth as advertised.
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 117 pounds and ordered a Small. It's huge and fits weird. Does not have a large neck, so would be very difficult to wear it off the shoulder. The front is longer than the back which does look a bit odd. But I'm most disappointed in the torso fit. It's just odd and hangs weird. The fabric is soft and it does seem decent quality. I wish the fit was better. I guess this will be my &#34;period&#34; sweater. No one will ever notice any bloat on me it's so baggy! Lol!"
3.0,It's nice but they sent me one that don't work.
3.0,I love the band I like that it is a buckle
3.0,"This looks really nice, and I do mean really nice, but it is very hard to open or close and very hard to reach into and out of, in order to carry anything. It strikes me as purely decorative and I gave it to someone who is using it for costuming, because it isn't useful for any other purpose. This gets one star as a useful bag and five stars for the look, for use as part of a costume, so I am giving it three stars."
3.0,Product is light weight and feels good around neck on face etc.  After a week of usage it does feel streched out and lose. And starts to have lines in material.<br />Chinese quality use throw away after a week.
3.0,"In a close look the design is kind of faded, cheap material."
3.0,"I wanted to like it, but the torso area was too long for me. If I was a bit taller, it would have been a great jumpsuit."
3.0,As others reviewed and said top was small but shorts bigger. If you need last minute OK -I did not and I returned
3.0,"Did not fit as expected and returned pants. I did like the material, seems durable for what I needed."
3.0,"Very cute dress, and worked great in theory. Fit everywhere but the chest was too small so the seam was across the middle and it just looked stupid."
3.0,"I really like these glasses, they help so much when looking at the computer screen and iPhone screens.<br />Unfortunately, it says qty 2 on the box but there was only 1 pair in the box... bummer! Can you ship me the blue ones?"
3.0,"It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs just not the sweatshirt I thought it was. It‚Äôs like a weird light shirt material."
3.0,"I used the measuring scale, but still you cannot slide these over the ends because the glasses have rubber ends. I did use these on glasses with only plastic frames and that was fine. They are well made, comfortable and look good, but over priced when compared to other options. Again I bought these because the chart said they would fit. A friend told me they believe the page said will not fit rubber tipped ends, but I didn‚Äôt see it or I missed it."
3.0,They are too expensive for the quality.
3.0,"1/3 OF THE ORDER OF THESE FINGER LIGHTS ARE NOT WORKING. I NEED THEM ASAP AND HOPE WE GET A REPLACEMENT SEND, WITHOUT A BIG HUSSLE. I LET YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES. THANK YOU"
3.0,"It is a pretty watch, and I get compliments on it daily. I use it in both casual and professional attire. However, the watch loses a couple minutes every day so I need to re-calibrate the time often."
3.0,The band looks good even though it feels inexpensively made. It fits my watch well but up close you can see that the part where the band links to the watch is uneven and does not look uniform from left to right. My least favorite part of this band though is that it does not use pins or another easy system to de-link/resize the watch. This band used pressure plates that are VERY difficult to remove and reinsert.
3.0,Its was a little large.
3.0,The material is not what I expected  the skirt fit as expected
3.0,"Looks great in the picture and super cute, however, when it arrived it was super cheap looking.  I returned for a refund!"
3.0,"Cute, very thick fabric. Runs small"
3.0,Bought these for my son for gym class because they're non-marking soles and don't cost an arm and a leg. They're definitely light weight and cute but the bottoms are not your normal soles. They're kind of plastic like which makes it slippery on a gym floor.  Definitely not a good gym shoe if this is what you're buying it for!!
3.0,"It is pretty, but is much smaller (thinner) than what it appears in listing. Not bad for the price. May have helped to have a picture of the ring on someone's actual hand."
3.0,"Hat fits great, gloves way too small"
3.0,"Very pretty ,need to have large foot"
3.0,There‚Äôs a fairly large battery pack tucked in the mask which is quite annoying. It‚Äôs also not as bright as it appears in photos
3.0,"I'm not sure if these are polarized, which makes me wonder about how well they're protecting my eyes (maybe the UVA/UVB is also incorrect in the listing??)."
3.0,"For a brand name pair of pants, these are a bit depressing. Fits tight around the shins and rides low in the waist. Material is not very soft. Just ok."
3.0,"The outfit is beautiful. However, it's hard to get into. Took about 10 minutes to put on. Wore a bathing suit under it and went horseback riding. There's no stretch so it was right in the crotch area. Took it off to get in the water and couldn't get back into it because it became so detangeled. Ended up throwing it away. Didn't even get a pick in it."
3.0,It's a handy thing to have if you have more than just passport...
3.0,Bought a black one in large that fit perfectly so i decided to buy a white one as well in large but it was a lot smaller. Different sizes with different colors.
3.0,"Beautiful ring, but made for a child's finger - I normally wear size 6, but it didn't fit any of my fingers"
3.0,"Ordered two shirts, they came separately, each had a different sleeve lengths."
3.0,Must order up
3.0,Held more pictures then I needed
3.0,was not the actual size.  Too small.
3.0,"I really liked them when I got them, but when I went to wear them, they were at least 1/2 size too big. I brought an 8 which is my usual size and I've worn that size in Soda's before. But in these my foot could slide way forward into the toe and my heel slipped way too much. If they hadn't been regular style shoes, they would have fallen off my feet. I actually could put them on without unzipping them. I'm returning them."
3.0,"I'm still on the fence with these. I like the weight , and the concept just having a hard time with lenses so small. I feel there is gonna be an adjustment period and I'm in to try.  I do dig that I can put on eye makeup again as well as super convenient for out shopping. So they have their perks. Be even cooler if they filterd blue light, js."
3.0,Somewhat disappointed. It didn't stay in place in my ear
3.0,"They are a fairly comfortable shoe. They run a bit big in every aspect (width, length.) but Instead of sending them back, I bought gel inserts to put in on top of the insert that is already in the shoe to help tighten up around the foot more.<br /><br />My only complaint is it doesn‚Äôt have a zipper on the inside of the ankle for quick in and out. Overall it‚Äôs not a bad product. The shoes breathe well."
3.0,"This is a OK necklace, It is MUCH larger than I thought is was going to be. I was thinging something the size of my thumb nail and what came was a plastic 2 inch thing. I bought this to go with a pair of cute apple earrings, but I'm not sure if I will wear this or not..."
3.0,Used these for work. One was a little sharp and scratched the inside of my nose
3.0,"short in the back size, (i dont know why)<br />but is still a good dress, but stremely short in the back,<br />You can not bend without showing the back"
3.0,"First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. The Hugitout Pendent Necklace has a very nice presentation that comes in a nice little jewelry box that's in a cute pink pouch. But the necklace itself, I was a little disappointed because, it wasn't what I was expecting. The necklace is super thin, I feel too thin, which in the picture it looks a little more thicker than it really is. The pendents are very cute but if they were bigger you could appreciate it more. You may find this necklace a good size for a child/teen but it's so thin with a teen wearing this, I can see it getting accidentally snatched of their necks super easy. I can't really recommend this necklace for the price, cause of it's thinnest and it's so easy to break which is too bad cause this necklace could have good potential."
3.0,can not wear it. it will not fit around me
3.0,"Not that my butt is overly large, but the pants ride down in the bag and I feel I have to  pull them up all the time."
3.0,To long It would look better on a tall person and am short but wear it around the house.
3.0,Way to big at least 2 sizes  otherwise seem like good quality
3.0,"While i love the print and the color, it is a unisex T shirt. Not flatterin. Also probably my fault for not reading the fine lines... but NOT cotton."
3.0,The bag is super cute. The strap broke the second time I carried it. The lights broke before Christmas. Disappointed.
3.0,Not soft material at all.  Shorts fits smaller than top.  Shorts are smaller
3.0,"The mask is rather small, and it fails to fully cover one's news and mouth; however, I do have a somewhat large face, so perhaps that is the problem. Really, I just bought the mask because it is a symbol of the state of New Mexico; so, as an item that I'm not actually going to use ( just going to put in my memory boxes of 2020), I am  satisfied with the purchase."
3.0,Ordered in my normal size but it seems short.
3.0,"I do like this bag, but just beware, it's small. And the strap isn't quite long enough to wear as a crossbody but almost long enough if you are OK with it on your side as opposed to on your hip."
3.0,This one size was off for I ordered a size six and it was much too tight I had to give it to my daughter but apart from that it is a nice fashion ring with its shiny attractive look.
3.0,"It fits too tight on my waist, but I‚Äôm trying to stretch it out a bit by wearing it on my hips when I‚Äôm around the house."
3.0,I was unaware when I bought this for my daughter that the heart lollipop earrings are the size of actual lollipops.  I thought they would be much smaller just like the rest of the earrings in the set.  They certainly are a conversation starter.
3.0,It's okay for the price
3.0,they are huge enough for 2 ears in each side
3.0,"Expected rhinestone on straps not<br />metallic strip, but for the money it‚Äôs wearable."
3.0,The Christmas Earmuffs are super cute but I open the package the little mushrooms were broken off. They need to be shipped in a better package since they are delicate.
3.0,I can‚Äôt move with out the buttons flying open!
3.0,"It was a really pretty dress, but I ended up returning it. The straps were so tight on my arms, and my arms are pretty thin. They don't hang nicely like in the pictures. Definitely size up on this one."
3.0,Nice material and fits well. But stitching is loose in some spots.
3.0,I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter and it was very tight. Now looking to purchase another charm bracelet that is larger. The package that was sent with the bracelet was a cheap little draw string bag.  Not impressed
3.0,I wanted to love this. It fits a bit larger than the other athletic jackets on here. The craftsmanship on the inside looks unfinished. The pockets are different heights this some of the stitching on the outside and to me it‚Äôs noticeable. The top of the jacket where they have material to cover the top of the zipper gets in the way and the zipper easily gets stuck on it. For me it‚Äôs a no and will be going back.
3.0,"Its okay for the price, gets snagged on everything though."
3.0,"I didn't realize it'd be that big!<br /><br />looks totally fake too<br /><br />good for cheesy kids costumes, otherwise, not great<br /><br />Its sitting in my closet but its so cheesy looking that I don't want to use it with any of my costumes<br /><br />not bad quality though"
3.0,"Good quality not cheap as expected but the color is not true to the color pictured. It is more yellow and not cream colored like pictured. I'm not a huge fan of the yellow, it is a weird yellow shade."
3.0,"The different strands come apart fairly easily. Doesn't look well crafted up close. From a distance, it has a nice look, but close inspection makes it look inexpensive. Tough to pair with a very elegant dress. Might be better for a dress-down look like w/jeans or something more casual."
3.0,Awesome hat and beautiful art work but it was smashed in a bag during shipping and i can't get the form back.
3.0,"While we ordered the wrong size, my rating is based on the fact that the quality is a little disappointing."
3.0,The only thing wrong with these is the top opening is small and cuts off circulation. Not for those with large arms or medium sized biceps.
3.0,I bought this for my sunglasses but they didn't fit; so i had to buy newones. Is lightweight and excellent for protection. The reason i'm giving it 3 stars is because only thin eye and sunglasses will fit.
3.0,The arch is off and these were not comfortable. I sent them back.
3.0,Strings break too easily
3.0,Really liked it besides everytime I took it off it pulled my hair badly.
3.0,"the bottoms do not cover everything the way you would imagine, but they fit okay.  The top runs very large and barely stays on if you are less than a DD"
3.0,"So i actually got the blue version from this company which for some reason seemed a lot better quality. This one is thinner and the material feels cheaper. It's still super cute and looks nice, just doesn't feel as nice. This would be nice to not make your head sweat with it being thinner. It does not have fur on the inside flaps of your head. I just got one so that I could match my husbands blue one. For me it works, I think it's cute. But if you are looking for a high quality nice one, I'd look elsewhere."
3.0,Im sure it describes how it fits but i didnt tead the description. That or my heads just fat.
3.0,The back of this dress with the tie was awkward.
3.0,"The dress fabric is thin and you can see the stitching. The size and fit is great, just thin fabric. I even got the dark dress with the flower<br />It's very pretty but thin. Love the pocket, great for at home only."
3.0,I ordered XL size and it barely fit me my breast size is 36 DD and it feel kinda of tight unfortunately that's the biggest size they have for that blouse and it's NOT stretch at all.
3.0,They run small so tight over nose. Makes them uncomfortable.
3.0,"I really like this hat but I wish I looked at the reviews and the photos more carefully. That hat has writing on both sides! Like another user said though, it can easily be taken off with a seam ripper."
3.0,Zipper was poor quality and separated when I sat down. Fit was fine
3.0,"Should have read the reviews. This is thinner than lace panties, and runs very small."
3.0,"I loved it, it just started falling apart after about a month."
3.0,"disappointed in how it is made, picture makes you think its nice but received and its very cheaply made and not as nice in person as in picture."
3.0,"These are a great idea and I wish they would have worked for my needs. The bank is small enough to go into my handbag or a pocket. But being small limits the amount of bills that can be inserted into the slot. It would really be beneficial to have a baby sitter hold it for me!<br />Great idea if it‚Äôs for someone that has only a few bills to shove into these banks.  Like they say, ya gotta go big or go home!"
3.0,Dress is cute just as pictured but I purchased the 4T-5T option. Dress tag says medium and looks more like a 6-7. Not sure if we can make this work for my toddler.
3.0,My son loves the sweater.
3.0,The tail does not like to stay in place and always comes undone. I switched back to the band the watch came with.
3.0,When the earrings came there were items missing from the order including the bending of the posts of the earrings. The toothpick like prongs that secure the earring were slightly bent from poor packaging practices.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law, it‚Äôs too small for him to actually be able to use"
3.0,I gave this ring as a gift and the finish came off of it 100% inside of 1 month after she started to wear it.
3.0,Delivery prompt.  Top wrinkles easy and falls off shoulders.  Sizing off.
3.0,Run a a little small<br />Bought for a camping trip
3.0,Thin and shiny
3.0,"Read the reviews, everyone said it fit as expected and it did, but if you don‚Äôt want it to cling and want it to feel a bit baggy and loose, get 2 sizes up"
3.0,Not an official NFL shirt...
3.0,They are nice but much smaller that shown in the picture of in the description only like half of them are the size shown
3.0,Light weight fabric compared to the Gap's and tighter.
3.0,Smaller than except
3.0,Not very good quality.  With each wash the design deteriorates.
3.0,"Anklet is not adjustable it is a 10 inch anklet only. The anklet seems sturdy, But hangs all the way down to the bottom of ankle. I would have like for it to be adjustable it would give me a better fit."
3.0,"The socks are nice, comfortable and fit well but they are NOT NO SHOW!  They actually come up quite high on the front and back of the foot, so they would show if worn with a classic espadrille."
3.0,Great quality and style but too small
3.0,"The necklace had a knot in the chain, took forever trying to untangle. Other than that it's a nice gift for my niece."
3.0,"Not that good for motorcycle riding, fingers don't have enough room, and I have average size hands"
3.0,fabric doesn't look as fabulous in real life.
3.0,I am 4‚Äô10 and 96lbs and it is gigantic. Looks like i am wearing a potato sack. Quality is good at least.
3.0,"The shirt is very cute-good color-but it is very small, despite the fact that I ordered larger than what I normally wear. Not a lot of room in chest area, and I am average (C). Too bad."
3.0,fit quite small
3.0,"Too short, flimsy fit"
3.0,The large is like a size 8
3.0,"These work OK given certain caveats. I got them for a pair of house binoculars I have hanging around that tend to gather a lot of dust on the lenses. They are old Bushnells and are rather squat compared to newer binoculars. I therefore have to adjust the bungie cording to fit them. The last resort fitting solution by the instructions which are pretty good instructions by the way. My major issue issue with them is using them without the neck strap around the neck or without one at all. They still do their job but getting back on the binocs can be a bit of a Rubics cube experience, as they become entangled and  twisted and require a degree of concentration to get back on, best done by one who has been through the learning curve rather than the one you handed the binocs off to. The second caveat I would mention is that they are hard plastic and therefore a bit noisy as they jumble about on the neck strap. Not an issue on in house binocs but on a field pair they may jump an in-close prey or subject."
3.0,Love the length but zipper isn‚Äôt the best quality.
3.0,"The pink is a little see-through. The fit is a little weird for my body style as the swing skirt makes me look large. I am  5'0&#34; 112lb with hourglass shape. Someone with narrow hips and/or long legs would probably do well with this style. Fabric is fine, otherwise a good buy. I wear it around the house."
3.0,"Super cute and comfortable ... but ... very difficult to get the pins into the band. As shown in the pictures, the process caused a casualty. Got a blood stain on the band too, also depicted in the pictures. Otherwise, it would have gotten five stars."
3.0,I was expecting a Swiss spring bar tool purchased separately to be amazing in comparison to a spring tool bar included with a watch band purchase.  I could have easily gotten by with just a free spring bar tool and did not need to purchase a Bergeon tool and replacement forks.
3.0,It fits but it is a little small for an extra large.
3.0,"I love the style, it's great over leggings - and I love the pockets. The fit was fine - I ordered a large because I wanted it to hang on me, not be snug. It was perfect. The only thing I do not like is that there is a shiny clear line about 1/3 inch wide that runs down the middle of the shirt - all the way to the bottom. It looks as it was folded in half for shipping, but somehow faded a bit in this area. I ordered another color too, and it was the same. I will see after washing how it looks; if it changes for the better, I will report back."
3.0,A lot more side boob than one would expect. I‚Äôm not a heavy top by any means but my boobs still felt exposed on the side. The material is a lot heavier than I thought and definitely not flowy.
3.0,A nice set even though it is larger than I expected
3.0,Received after 2 weeks from ordering date.<br />Color is little bit off. I ordered white hat and it is more like light tan. For $3 it is OK hat.
3.0,"I'm shirt and chubby so I went one size up to have a little extra room and it's huge! Big, boxy, no shape, orange tent. And then the neckline stretched out and I can't wear it without a tank top under it. It's a hot mess. Kinda like the Flyers this year. I'll end up using it for pajamas since I'm not sure I want to wear it in public."
3.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this item.  The pants fit well, if a little snug.  The material seems thin, but one can not complain due to the price point.  I wore them to work and the pants held up well.  I plan on handling with care as they may not last as long as pricier pants that are thicker.  These work for my needs though .  I am pleased enough to purchase another pair."
3.0,"however the lock changed color quickly, the stone fell off too soon.  I wish if the bracelet was a little bigger. nonetheless,<br />I love it and still wear it."
3.0,"Like, use for travel"
3.0,"The item was way too big, had to do too many adjustments."
3.0,"These glass are okay, but I can't see out of them. So, I am unable to use them."
3.0,"The sleeve is too short, fore me"
3.0,Very nice blouse. But it didn't fit me all loosely like I thought.  Strange fitting... Sort of loose at bottom but tight at breast area. If you have Large boobies please size up for your boobies sake. Now I have something that is useless for me. They need to make better clothing for large cheated women. Clothes that supports our big boobies and all. And I'm just speaking in general. Because I refuse to get a breast reduction. I love my natural big breast. ‚úåüèΩ
3.0,"I followed the sizing instructions and to me, the laces come up short. I used them on canvas shoes that are not super bulky, just normal lace-up shoes.<br /><br />These were a royal pain to get on my shoes - lots of adjusting, tightening, tugging, swearing, and broken nails. Definitely do not do this if you've just had your nails done!<br /><br />Of course you don't want the laces super loose, but these really did not look to me like the right size.<br /><br />I don't understand why companies do this - you saved a few cents on the laces, but I won't be ordering more laces for my other sneakers or recommending you to my friends.<br /><br />It's a struggle to get the shoes off and on now, so I just don't wear the shoes as much."
3.0,"While this bag isn‚Äôt the trendiest, it seems very durable. It‚Äôs a little taller than the dimensions listed but it would still serve it‚Äôs purpose. I like all the storage pockets, but since it‚Äôs too tall I‚Äôm not going to be using it. I also didn‚Äôt care for the fact that the sound of the zippers jingling remind me of a backpack. If the size was right, I could have overlooked that fact. Overall, good bag, but not trendy."
3.0,Very small. Ordered for my daughter and didn't fit her head.
3.0,"The shoes were very nice, white and cute. However a few weeks later, the bow on one side came loose so now it hangs long. I tried gluing it back....fail."
3.0,its cute it was way to big for me not like the others that i had ordered. gave it to my mother
3.0,"This coat runs fairly small. I'm 5' 10&#34; and a size 10, I usually purchase XL coats so I can layer comfortably. I bought this coat in an XL and with just a single layer underneath it's snug, but wearable. I can't comfortably sit when it's zipped. However, it is very warm and durable. Great for the Chicago winter. The hood is very roomy and comfortable. I often find that hoods are thin and not very useful, but not here."
3.0,It ran much larger than expected. I'm not sure if I'll keep it
3.0,Very cute but after a couple weeks it‚Äôs starting to crack and the picture is wearing off
3.0,The pictures posted are very misleading. The curl pattern on this is more like a 4B type of hair. The picture builds it is definitely not the same. But the curl pattern is very nice. It does shed a little bit. The knots are pretty thick so you may have to bleach the knots for longer. I would recommend it personally BUT they have to put the correct picture of the product up here.
3.0,"The fit was exact, but the color is off. The picture shows a darker blue than what comes in. It's more of a lighter heather blue."
3.0,"On the positive side, they are lightweight and somewhat flexible.  On the downside, they fit very loose and feel like they will fall off my face.  The optics are fair with darker than preferable vision.  Things do not look sharp or crisp through these lenses.  Guess you get what you pay for.  Spend the $ for better quality."
3.0,"So cute but wore it for a week and developed a rash on my neck.  Also, the back of the bean looked tarnished after wearing.  I cleaned the necklace but it didn't get it's shine back."
3.0,"Beautiful color, love the fit, flattering. Material is thin with loose knit easily pulled."
3.0,"I don‚Äôt like the legs, they are a little larg."
3.0,"Put this on my Seiko field watch.  Wanted a single clasp type, diver type band for easy on and off.  The metal clasp is a little thin - light gauge - had to squeeze it in with a pair of needle nose pliers so it clasped tighter.  Also the band itself was a little heavier than I wanted it to be, so I ended up taking if off."
3.0,i love the color and material was okay but I didn‚Äôt find this dress very flattering. The skirt part is too long and loose and I don‚Äôt think I will ever wear it
3.0,No real warmth more of an novelty item<br />I thought this would be less scary for the roads and children in cars but I think NOT now
3.0,"This belly button ring is the CUTEST thing ever. It is absolutely adorable but sadly it only lasted about two months and then the jewel fell out and it started tarnishing. I kind of expected that to happen and I almost want to buy another because it's so damn cute, but I don't know if it'll be worth it to have it last for such a short amount of time. Not bad for the price, just doesn't hold up. *Do note that in the photos I've posted, the jeweled part that screws on top is from a different piece of jewelry I have. I swapped it out for the one that this set comes with, which is just the silver ball top shown in the product pics."
3.0,The earrings are too large for the shape of my ear lobes. This is not the fault of the earrings. I will be returning them.
3.0,"The material and color of the shirt is great but I didnt like the sleeves, they just felt way too big or poofy for my liking. But other than that is a cute shirt."
3.0,It‚Äôs size very small
3.0,Just a little too small to go over my glasses
3.0,The fabric was sewn slightly off center so I had to cut the neckline and one sleeve to fix it. The fabric is nice and the dress is very cute.
3.0,"I ordered the set in Small. The bottoms fit exactly as expected but the top feels like a Medium, I even had to double check the tag.  The bottoms are comfy so I'm going to run stitches down the sides of the tops to make it fit better."
3.0,Much smaller than it seems. I cant fit more than my small wallet and phone in thd bag and have trouble closing it. Still cute
3.0,Package was marked correctly with the shirt ordered. However the shirt that it contained was a different graphic. Still looked very good. Was bought for a BIG man (4x) however the shirt even though showing 4x was smaller than any other 4x. Decided not to return item and gave as a gift to someone else that it would actually fit. Decided not to reorder due to the size running small. Estimated that the actual size was closer to 2x. Included image of actual shirt that arrived.
3.0,"Although the gloves are longer than most, they are not extra long<br />  I bought them to wear with long sleeves as sun block when riding my motor bike.<br />  There is still a gap at the wrist.<br />  They are nice enough and o can wet them too cool off on the triple digit heat"
3.0,The shirt runs small. The discretions says some graphics may have glitter. There are different designs. This one is pictured with no glitter. The Dragonfly is covered in gold glitter. The company charges $6 to return the shirt. The shirt only cost $9.33. So I guess I‚Äôm keeping it or selling it in a garage sale.
3.0,The elephant pendant was extremely small and the shape was not exactly as advertised.  I approve of the product but it could have been much better
3.0,"Nothing spectacular. It's just ok. The fit is a little loose, but I'm a true rectangle body shape, so I could have sized down."
3.0,The fabric is very thin and I don't expect the socks to last. I have wide toe spacing and they feel snug on me.
3.0,"The top fits great! I bought this for Thanksgiving and definitely couldn‚Äôt have an extra piece of pie. The Elastic in the waistband of the pants is not tacked down so,if your stomach pokes out a little bit, it gets all twisted inside the pant."
3.0,"I wanted to love this top.  It's pretty.  I like the material and the design is classy.  It fit great on the arms and chest. Below that, it got weird and looked almost like a maternity top or that it was stretched out. I returned it."
3.0,"Buy a size up! Even in the super cheap Chinese leggings that always run small I wear an XL. I should have gotten an XXL for these. They run a bit small and there's not much stretch to them. That being said, they do seem to be good quality and I could see them being very comfortable in the right size."
3.0,Daniel marlin pelle belt is made of genuine and durable leather and the color of the belt looks like dark gray and it has got antique finish buckle and it strong and clasp fit well in the hole in the belt. Another thing that I noticed is that this belt is short in length. And it comes in a carry bag.
3.0,"I mean, you get a lot in this pack which is nice, but the overall quality isn't great and the rings were pretty big for my nose."
3.0,The quality doesn‚Äôt seem to be the same as in the picture as of now I‚Äôm not overly impressed it seems more like a 3 or 4 dollar thing
3.0,Love the design but the fabric is cheap and not breathable
3.0,Fit OK.
3.0,"Was a little disappointed, but not surprised to find the material is really thin. They‚Äôre very funny pants still. And comfy! But will have to toss them soon as there are holes in mine already."
3.0,"Very good product, but very overpriced."
3.0,Nothing really to rave about here. You get what you pay for. I have used this twice when I traveled. Protcets your glass from scratches but nothing else. I suppose I should have realized that.
3.0,It brake easily .
3.0,This shirt is cute but runs on the smaller size! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 155 lbs and have dds so it‚Äôs a bit tight and rides up my stomach. I got a medium btw.
3.0,The dress was too big. I should have bought a small instead
3.0,I sent the hat back because it was too pink.  The color on my monitor made it look more of a neutral which is not at all.  Would be perfect for a younger person with more pink in their outfit.  Not me though.  It fit well though and was a reasonable price.
3.0,To big for my child. Fits an adult.
3.0,"The sleeves were not nearly as long as the description claimed. I ordered both the green and the purple shirts at the same time, and the green feels like it is much smaller than the purple."
3.0,"Out of the package it looks huge, but once I tried it on it fit pretty snugly, and doesn't have too much stretch. I suggest ordering a size up."
3.0,"These socks are good, but not at all durable. I'd say they last about five to 10 wearings max before the sole goes through. I bought them to replace my underarmour socks, which lasted about three years, so the lack of durability is very obvious. They are comfortable and have a little rubber strip in the back of the heel that keeps them on your foot inside your shoes, but I can't recommend them, sadly. Very disappointing."
3.0,The headbands look great except the army green (the main reason why I bought this set) isn't green at all. It is a chocolate brown. üòí
3.0,"Cute cardigan overall but not as long as it appears in the picture. Definitely order up, especially if you have bigger arms like me."
3.0,I do not like how this swimming suit fits. It would've been perfect if the cups were made bigger and the straps weren't removable. This was definitely not made for ladies with large breasts.
3.0,"SuPer cute! Only problem... One of the chains broke (I bought two of these). Other than that, love them"
3.0,"Decent product, gets the job done but is a bit fragile. 2 of the clasps broke apart within the first day, although they're relatively easy to reattach."
3.0,"missing a prong, but for price, not worth shipping back to china."
3.0,Loved it when it arrived though small it was a stunning peice... why 3 stars? Sadly the two little gems on either side both fell out... I could get them replaced but it is obvious that they are not well secured... It still looks ok with out the gems but still was upsetting to see them so easily fall out.
3.0,The black rings for women fade and jewls sloppy put in
3.0,Nice- but very small- hard to read engraving.
3.0,its a very slim fit I have to return for a size I never wear
3.0,Loved the blouse and it fit great.
3.0,"It‚Äôs Pretty!<br />It is smaller than I anticipated, but cute.<br />The metal for the chain is very low grade which lead to my skin being brunt (had a rash around my neck for a week)."
3.0,"The sizing seems Ok, but the cut is a bit high waisted. The color is accurate and it seems sewn well."
3.0,I love the colors and the material but I have a 4g hole. Wanted to go up to a 2g.. these were smaller than my 4g and fall out of my ears.
3.0,These knee socks could come up just abit higher.......
3.0,"Not what I was hoping for, but can use for another plan.  VERY bright, I thought it might be more muted color, more silky feel.<br />I am creating gift baskets for Scholarship auction."
3.0,It‚Äôs okay. Fabric‚Äôs thinner than I like. Can see the undershirt design and I was looking for a more thicker material but it fits correctly. I‚Äôd wear a blank shirt under it.
3.0,The 9 we got our son was too big while the 8 was too small.
3.0,"I like the shirt.  It fits just like the picture and looks just like the picture everywhere except the arms.  The arms are a good inch shorter than every other shirt I have like this one.  The fabric is nice, as well."
3.0,"Cheesy.. but it does the job for the price. It doesn't look like garbage nor expensive. It was just right, in the middle.. a 3‚òÜ Not a bold statement, just enough to say that's pretty.. not gaudy or cheesy like some I've seen."
3.0,Beautiful worth the price
3.0,fit perfect as expected
3.0,Very good quality. The fit is a little bit tight. I don't like the hood.
3.0,"While the style is super cute, the top is super big. I normally wear a M or L, size 10ish in jeans. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 160 lbs. I don‚Äôt like shirts to be fitted, but the size of this top is just too much. Size down several sizes. Despite sizing down, it is still MUCH bigger than I would like. It is really unflattering, like wearing a bag. BUT, I really want to love it. I‚Äôm going to try a few different things and see if I can make it work. The material is thin but not in a sheer or clingy way, I like it."
3.0,"faded black color, the medium size is snug...not stretchy."
3.0,"Not true to size, my daughter loves them but after a week some of the lights didn't work ‚òπÔ∏è ,which has her frustrated"
3.0,The glasses are OK if you take into account their price.  My major problem is that they are engraved with &#34;Polar Spex&#34; on the right lens.  Not exactly manly.  This lens is conveniently turned away in the picture for the product.
3.0,"I wish I would‚Äôve gotten an XL, normally a large fits big. But this pullover fits snuggly. The arms are cut shorter than normal also. This pullover is so pretty! It‚Äôs not super thick nor thin. The colors and pattern is nice and well distributed. It appears to be well made, haven‚Äôt washed yet. The bottom band fits snug. So it doesn‚Äôt rise up during daily movements. It‚Äôs really comfy too!"
3.0,"I got a medium and it runs tight at the hips and the underbust of the top. I measured the top and bottom with a tape I have at home and it‚Äôs accurate to the sizing image.<br /><br />Body stats: 5‚Äù5, 140lbs, underbust 31‚Äù (medium is at 28‚Äù) and hips at 36‚Äù( medium is at 30‚Äù and you can see that squeeze happening in my photo lol)<br /><br />The suit is NOT flexible. Follow the measurements in the image!"
3.0,"Be ready, nipples will show but we both like that"
3.0,"The company that sent these was very quick.  The shoes arrived in perfect condition.  A friend of mine had said that she wouldn't get this type of shoe because she thought they were dangerous and that children should wear helmets.  After watching my son struggle with them, and taking a pretty bad fall, I realized that helmets must be worn at ALL times while using these shoes. My son is very athletic.  I also thought the wheels would pop back in when not in use, but that is not the case with this particular shoe.  The wheels have to be taken out.  We might end up just using the shoe part of this and throw the wheels away.  An expensive tennis shoe.  If I could go back, I would have just bought my son inline skates."
3.0,"This too is cute and I love the cropped fit and the button detail. However, i have a problem with the book and eye closure across the chest area staying closed and occasionally I have found myself inadvertently flashing people. I am going to try adding a small snap to help keep it closed."
3.0,The fit is good and the size is perfect for my hands. The colors are nice too and they wear well together. The white broke within a few weeks though so I only gave it 3 stars. But I‚Äôm hopeful the others will last longer. Color doesn‚Äôt fade and they don‚Äôt absorb other colors like from fabrics or cleaning products.
3.0,"Should have ordered one size larger. After adding items to pockets, I'm not able to zip it closed."
3.0,"It looks very nice but yes this is a kid size!  It works for me because I bought it for my very small 4 years old and it fits her! So if your an adult, it would probably not fit!"
3.0,I like the shirt but it's tight around the arms and waist a bit. I got a XL and I wear L.
3.0,"I didn‚Äôt like the length, they were too short. I am 5‚Äô7 and they came above my ankles!"
3.0,"Good hat, great for the price. But it was too small for my boyfriend's head, and he's a M. The hat holds it's structure so it doesn't flex much."
3.0,"These are great quality, but seem Little short in length"
3.0,"Just okay.  It is pretty cheap looking, but I guess I'll keep it to wear around the pool.  I wouldn't wear it out."
3.0,"So the pictures don't really show how big they are because they are huge. I wanted smaller chandelier earrings but these literally almost touch my shoulder. I bought 4 pairs! I will probably keep them because not worth sending back. I probably can wear these but its gonna have to be on a special occasion when you are going on a dramatic look. Not something I would wear around town when I just need a little pop with my outfit. :(  (Since I bought 4, you will see the same review on three earrings.)"
3.0,"The male itself is lovely, but there is no &#34;guru&#34; bead, so I just keep going around and around...."
3.0,Seems like a good jacket but definitely runs small- I measured before purchase and still too small.  Had to return. Will prob buy a larger size at a later date
3.0,"This sweater covers just the arms, making it good to wear over short sleeves in the winter. I have a sleeveless black dress that this works well with- now I can wear it year-round.  It's soft and looks nice on.<br /><br /> I typically wear a L to XL in tops, mostly depending on the sleeve length. This XL just fits me- I wish it was just a little bit bigger.  The sleeves are also not loose enough that I could really layer long sleeves under it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item for free in exchange for posting my honest review."
3.0,"These pants are ok, the material is slightly on the thin side. The fit is a little awkward, it might just be on me, I'm 5'7 125lbs and it just doesn't fit quite right"
3.0,"These are really cute, but extremely small. My 8 year old niece found them too tight to wear. If they were bigger I would give them a 5 star!"
3.0,"Ordered a lg, pants fit nice top should have been extra lg"
3.0,"Easily bent to enlarge or make smaller. I used this in my finger, not a toe."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this dress. Fun print for summer. After buttoning the 59 buttons I tried it on. The fit was great. The material was nice and light, perfect for summer. But the shoulders have a slight puff to them. And it killed the whole look. Husband said I looked Amish. No offense to the Amish but not my style. Happy Amazon makes returning things so easy."
3.0,"I bought this thinking it was a standard fit since there wasn‚Äôt any information on it. It arrived and right on the tag it says ‚Äòslim fit‚Äô. If this was in the product description, I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it. I am very hesitant to buy another pair now."
3.0,"Not thrilled with the quality of these PJs. They will do for the price, but the neck hole is ridiculously large."
3.0,"I bought these based a pair sent from stitch fix, same size completely different fit. These pants also stretch a lot during the day.  They start out right and uncomfortable and within a couple hours are constantly falling down without a belt."
3.0,"This is a great idea- cheater bifocals! The problem is, the bifocal lens is only 2/3 of the width at most, so they don't really allow you to read normally. I got these as a bridge for my prescription bifocals to be repaired- they're a great reminder to go pick up my real frames from the eye doctor..."
3.0,"It looks great, it just doesn't fit."
3.0,my arms are too long for it so I have to keep them in the rolled mode at all times. My favorite shirt is same brand with no arm length issues.
3.0,"OK dress, but it was tight in strange places -- like my upper arm -- and loose if others."
3.0,My son loved the jeans.
3.0,"A bit disappointed because upon looking at all the reviews saying it fit like a second skin I got an extra size up. Not a good idea, too big for me. Shld have stuck with my true size and been much happier. Not a bad material and still serves its purpose but was hoping for a more tighter fit. I'm 6'2, 225..tried a 2x..."
3.0,"I'll be fair here. It's very well made so it gets 4-5 stars for manufacturing. It gets 2-3 stars for how it fits. It's floppy and wide. The longer I wore it, the more I didn't like it. It really IS a nice design and I like the orange/brown stitching but the overall fit was not what I liked."
3.0,Blue color ran all over had to wash it twice hope doesn‚Äôt run again<br />I really like style on me so I didn‚Äôt return it
3.0,It runs a little bit big.
3.0,"Nice but kind of cheaply made. But for the price, it is whats to be expected."
3.0,"I wish this fit me, but it didnt, not even a little. I was exploding out if every side of this and I wear am a 34H bra size so it makes sense, and I'm not mad about it, just bummed. why can't busty gals wear bralettes? still, it feels really soft and smooth and silky, so if you can fit yourself in this I think it'll be really nice"
3.0,I like the fact that it has not scent but there has been a couple of times it seems my beard is stiff after using it
3.0,Fits ok pads did not stay spray adhesive fixed .but del time was not good order thru prime
3.0,#3 on ten key works about 60 percent of the time when pressed. Sucks for an accountant.
3.0,"It isn't as heavy as I expected, but still plenty substantial to accomplish the goal  :-)  It's long and doesn't get tangled = WIN!"
3.0,Cute in the front but very thin and makes my bum look sad
3.0,The gold one broke before I even got to wear it UGH. The other two were good but got gross quick.
3.0,"Sadly, this dress was way too small for me. I gave it to a friend who wears a Medium. It fits her perfectly."
3.0,"I love the fabric. I love the design. I love the color. The S/M doesn't meet across the front of my body. The sleeves are perfect. The L/XL has shoulder seams that come halfway down the top of my arms. The sleeves are long, but can be rolled up. On both sizes, the length is fine.<br /><br />I am 5'4"", 108 lbs. Based on the reviews, one of the sizes should have worked. I love this robe, but I need a true Medium size, or a slightly larger Small. I returned the S/M, and am about to return the L/XL."
3.0,"The XL was too big, so don‚Äôt size up. The material is soft and comfortable. I liked the balloon sleeves which made it seem dressier if worn with slacks/heels. The top was all one color which is different than pictured. It would have looked nicer if the accent design was white as shown."
3.0,Bigger on my 6 year old daughter. Purchased a side 6..but fits her comfy so she says. Purchased them for pj day at school unfortunately since they‚Äôre big on her she can‚Äôt wear them for school but definitely at home.
3.0,"Shipping and handling, price was good but it is not one size fits all."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:75753e4c15ff32b5508aef12a39cb813]] I don't find this flattering on my body shape. The material is heavy. I don't think this will do well in humidity and the high heat of the summer.
3.0,"The picture for the product shows a brown squirrel, I got a pink and yellow one üòÑ. My son doesn‚Äôt care  and all but really misleading. It‚Äôs soft but the stitching is funny, the squirrels tooth is all messed up looking üòÇ"
3.0,Great idea but....
3.0,"I love the hat. But was a little disappointed when I put it on and found that it was quite snug. Perhaps it‚Äôs just my head. I will try to stretch it a little and see if that helps. But, again, I love this hat."
3.0,"There was no hole for the waist button... Stitching was there but the hole was never cut. The pocket lining is made from rainjacket like material. Sizing is true to the chart, but the color is a bit darker than pictured, and slightly yellowed. They are very cheap material (and just cheap to buy), but they look great!! Shippment arrived 2 weeks early than expected!"
3.0,Wish the waist part was sewn properly. If you sit down and the waistband rolls a little you can see the band. I'm just going to get it sewn closed. I would recommend that to be changed on future skirts sold. Besides that the color is size were exactly what I expected.
3.0,"Very cute jewelry. Unfortunately, this does not fit. It is extremely big, I thought I accidentally ordered a necklace/choker but it‚Äôs still too big even as a choker. I guess I should‚Äôve read the measurements but I shouldn‚Äôt have to when it clearly says bracelet but literally fits better as a necklace."
3.0,"Not really what I expected,  it has shoulder pads,  but easy to remove.  It was ok."
3.0,Fades after about 5-10 washes. The neck also stretches out around that many washes. Would expect it to hold up better.
3.0,Came as pictured they are flattering however the length was a little on the short side for me. I have a thick thigh area and they didnt make them unflattering surprisingly even with the shorter length. Color was bright and vibrant easy to match. I am an 8 to 10 depends on brands and I bought the L.
3.0,Hhh g
3.0,Smelled weird and was way too big
3.0,"The sizing is a little off, other than that its what‚Äôs I‚Äôm looking for. Can‚Äôt wait to use it soon!"
3.0,"These are so lightweight! But due to that, I feel like they are fragile also, although they haven't broken yet!<br /><br />Update 8/26/19: they are lightweight and somewhat flexible, but do not stay on my face while exercising. They keep sliding down my nose so I end up having to have to stop and take them off. :(. I think if the frames were more rigid, they would stay on my face better."
3.0,glued back together now they are back to normal
3.0,"Thin material in Yellow is too revealing to be worn for work or school. Darker colors tan, dark green bought in May 2020 did not have this problem. Fit (x-small) was perfect for my 5'3"" 115lb body. Did not shrink after 1st washing according to manufacturer's directions. Disappointed in light of good experience with prior purchase. Bought two. Will return unwashed one still unopened."
3.0,"Although the design and quality are great, it is hard to breathe through. It's made out of a silky material. I'm a teacher so I have to wear a mask all day and I couldn't make it through the first hour."
3.0,"It was hard to get used to wearing the band. Initially its not very comfortable, especially while sleeping.<br />I find myself constantly adjusting the band throughout the day.<br />As far as the cosmetics, very nice, stylish band but I am looking to replace this band with a more everyday comfortable wear band."
3.0,"I don't know why II didn't listen to the reviews, the pics make these jeans look good, They do not have the white hems, they're not low rise, they go above my belly button. they just look like thrift store mom jeans"
3.0,"Great concept, but not going to work for me. Had the belt tightened up so much in order to keep my cargo shorts from falling down I thought the belt loops were going to give up the ghost."
3.0,"I'm a size 10 so I rarely have trouble with shoes being too large. However, these were huge. They run really large so you might want to size down. However, the style is nice and they seemed like a decent shoe for the short time I was trying them on."
3.0,Not able to adjust
3.0,"it was fine but order one size up and it needs a seam, but that was easy for me to fix."
3.0,Nice hat but the sizing listed in the description is inaccurate. The XL should be 23.5 to 24 inches yet I measured  22.5 inches. The 1 to 1.5 inches smaller makes it M not an XL. Wish it would fit.
3.0,This is top has a beautiful wine color.  The material is different from other Lysee tops I own which are more stretch and flattering.  This fabric is a bit thick but not stretch at all.  The weakest feature is the fact that the neck is too large and when it is tied in the back looks too loose for my taste
3.0,"Fleece jacket arrived on time.  The fleece is warm though have not worn it since it's summer here now ... I was expecting the fleece fabric to be somewhat thicker ... but it's too thin in my opinion.  It seems to be well made though the zipper is plastic & I'm afraid it may not hold up to wear & tear.  I was expecting the jacket to have an inside pocket of some sort but it doesn't though it has two side zippered pockets.<br />Overall, I'm pleased with the jacket.  It will good for layering on cool days and autumn nights."
3.0,Kind of cheap feeling but cute.
3.0,I do like the color and pattern. It is a lightweight pretty scarf for spring or summer. However it is not as long or wide as pictured. It also did not come with the ring as advertised.
3.0,"The quality was nice, the bottoms fit nicely but the cups for the top were not made for anyone that‚Äôs not a size D ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3.0,Nice but I like the one without the pocket more :( fits better
3.0,love this dress but it was too small for a large size it was a small fit.
3.0,"Didn't look nothing like the picture, but kept anyway. I wear it as house attire, do not wear it in public. okay for lounging"
3.0,Different material than expected. Also says attack on Titans on the left side at the bottom. Has a few buttons to clip together.
3.0,Didn't keep it. While top part was see through. Couldn't even pull it off with a cream bra. Nice fit.
3.0,"This pouch is made well.  It has a sturdy clip and good zipper, so why did they use such weak velcro on the horizontal straps?  I bought this to wear horizontally on my belt, along my waistline.  The straps that are made for this are the two shorter ones, but the velcro is so weak it is constantly falling off.  I use the clip on a belt loop so that it doesn't fall all the way off, but I do not like my glasses just dangling at my side.  I want to reach them easily.  I will continue to use it, will probably eventually sew some very inexpensive, but much stronger velcro on these straps so that they hold."
3.0,"I was looking forward to receiving these.  When I got them, all 4 pieces were thrown together in a 3 x 4 size ziplock bag"
3.0,El logo esta alrevez
3.0,Only three snaps and hood doesn't detach
3.0,"Well I don't have a wide jawline or face so these glasses look to wide on me and I could do without the full frame and they should have a slightly tighter wrap. Don't like the Chrome designs protruding on the very wide arms, it gives the glasses an even wider look. I was able to modify mine slightly with a Dremel to loose the potrusion and a little black color to help the arms and I heated &#34;CAREFULLY&#34; the center bridge and gave the glasses more wrap around look and I like the look much better. But having to modify them annoyed me. I have an average face and everything on a Berkley rack looks fine on me. Just my opinion.<br />  However the lens are nice I like the what they do with color things are more rich and deep.<br />  Now to my rating is a three because looks are as important as the the lenses with Sunglasses. We all can agree there and the fact that I spent 20 minutes modifying them, an just the plain need for modification.<br />I gave them 3 first nice lenses. But I almost took it to two because of the factory look. These would be great if you have a wide face line and less bling on the arms."
3.0,"I do not like leggings that are tight, these are just right, not so tight they squeeze but form-fitting, soft, lightweight. They fit TTS. I wear capris all summer around the house so wanted comfy ones. I put these on as soon as I get home from work or being out.  These are perfect for summer.<br /><br />What I don't like are the comically long pockets.  They really stand out in real life, I didn't notice them in the product photos as being so large.  They give the wearer the appearance of extra weight along the sides of the thighs."
3.0,"The fit is good but after nearly a dozen washings, the dye was still rubbing off onto my legs. The dye issue has stopped and I still do like my jeans."
3.0,Looks beautiful but was a little small and the back came undone a few times
3.0,"They do their job, but dont expect high quality. They might last the summer which is all i hoped to get from these."
3.0,"This gift is okay, but would have expected a little more for the price. I didn't not give it away as a gift for an adult, but will keep it for a younger girl when the time is appropriate."
3.0,Very very small. Order 2 sizes up!!
3.0,Ordered 2 sizes too big and it fits like my actual size
3.0,Loved it !! But being bigger bust and 5 foot 8 was a little too short.  But wore with capri leggings.  The material did stretch....
3.0,"The pockets are great for your phone and water bottle on a shorter hike or dog walk. I bought 2...black and white in Large. I'm 5'7"" 135 Lbs. 38 C. Big discrepancy in sizes! The black fit great. The white was tight across the chest and had some strange big armpit gap on both sides. Wish manufacturers would double check their workmanship before they get sent out!"
3.0,Where are the buttons or snaps that keep this thing on? Am I supposed to expect that the sash keep me from flashing someone? How am I supposed to wear this to work?
3.0,Look greats but cheaper on EBay
3.0,"So on the plus side this fit well and was a great length, just like the picture. I am a size 18 and the 2x fit really well. The garment was packed well and free of stains and odor. Unfortunately it did not drape like it does in the picture and just looks like a housecoat that doesn't wrap. I am definitely sending it back. The lining, although nice, takes away from the coziness of a cardigan."
3.0,Neck line is much tighter and waistband is much shorter than picture shows.  Not good for tall women.  I returned mine.
3.0,"Flimsy and very thin, get the genuine lenses if you can afford them."
3.0,This is such a cute shirt but it fit weird. I really wanted to love it. But it's just OK.
3.0,"Very short, and see-through thin material"
3.0,"Good quality, but runs small."
3.0,"OK, A LITTLE LOOSE BUT GREAT FOR A SECOND PAIR"
3.0,It‚Äôs an ok hat. I‚Äôd say the only down side to this purchase is being a raiders fan
3.0,I really liked it... But one of the chains broke off after 1 week of wear and the heart fail off..
3.0,The color pink is more of a bubble gum pink than a blush pink
3.0,Love the earrings but one is longer than the other
3.0,"I really wanted to like them as they are good quality/ nice color/ fit well.  BUT...they made my son's feet really smelly after wearing them for a day, no matter how I washed them or how my son washed his feet, he always gets smelly feet with these socks.  This doesn't happen with his other socks.  Too bad."
3.0,"These pants are comfy but the waistline is cut too low, they won't fit if you have an ample booty."
3.0,The necklace is quite heavy and much bulkier than i expected so i will gift it for Christmas
3.0,"They look and feel /very/ good, but they make everything painfully green."
3.0,Ok gloves made by a small child... probably.  Not really flexible.
3.0,You can for sure see through this. It is smaller than I thought it would be. I had to return it. Good quality though.
3.0,A bit tight if you have fatter fingers. But a pretty ring
3.0,The color of the stone was not as dark as the picture.
3.0,"Love the strap, nice thick leather that matches my Fossil watch perfectly however, I have large wrists and the strap is pretty short and its very tight on my wrist, so tight I can't use it. If you have average to small wrists it's perfect."
3.0,"En la foto se ve de mejor calidad, pero al final queda muy bonita."
3.0,"The material of the whole bag including the gems is pretty thin. The chunky chain on the front is super lightweight as it is made of plastic. This definitely isn't an everyday bag, I just don't think it would hold up. It's probably not a good idea to carry anything heavy but I can see this being fun for a fancy costume or a night out every once in awhile."
3.0,"This is a very nicely made tank and I love the fabric; however, I ordered an XXL and it was still too small. I passed it on to my son's girlfriend who is very small and it fit her pretty well, although it was a tiny bit snug around her hips. Nice shirt but they need to make it in a normal size if they are going to sell it in America."
3.0,"I'm always on the lookout for long length boxer briefs that aren't super expensive like Jockeys. I got these at walmart, and thought these would be a good test.<br /><br />Length is great, doesn't seem to ride up and prevents friction, but it's little tight in the rear. I keep feeling like the butt is tight and the waistband is too low. They may loosen up after a few washes and wears but brand new these are a bit snugger than others in the 32-34 and long length boxer briefs"
3.0,Cute dress to big in the top area
3.0,"The cut is really flattering and it‚Äôs made really well, but unfortunately it runs about 1-2 sizes too small. It‚Äôs a total bummer, because the jacket is perfect in every other category :("
3.0,"Shoes were beautiful but super narrow on my normally average feet.<br /><br />Also, removing a star because when they didn‚Äôt fit, I had to pay my own shipping costs to return - $23 - beware that return shipping isn‚Äôt free if it doesn‚Äôt fit."
3.0,This is a basic white cotton camisole made from regular quality cotton. The camisole was comfortable but I had  problem with the cut of the clothing--the darting along the bust seemed very high for an XXL size.  I think the manufacturer should review the pattern design.
3.0,Im not sure why but I kept getting confused what the front was and the back was. They both look the same and mine didnt have  tag to help me. But it looked good. Just wasnt my style.
3.0,"As an avid fisherman, Winter in southern New England can be pretty challenging. The greatest enemy is THE WIND! Cold is cold but wind is brutal! Fingertips freeze and cause agonizing burn. Most gloves I‚Äôve tried don‚Äôt help in wind, these have. Haven‚Äôt seen any major wind but they‚Äôve worked thus far. They‚Äôre certainly not sporting gloves made for outdoor sports involving water, but my tips are warm."
3.0,If you only tried these on you'd say they're good. They have some stretch & good quality and fit well (unsure how they wash) but I bought 2 other brands and tried on 3 same day and the 2 other brands had 25% spandex and have so much more give when moving and sitting which make the other 2 pairs better for travel and exercise so I returned these. They did look nice on.
3.0,Cute hat but is too small. Doesn‚Äôt fit my 5 year old grandson!<br />So disappointed.
3.0,"It's cute and comfortable, but snags so easily and probably won't last very long."
3.0,"The watch band is very comfortable and I do appreciate not having a magnet like other metal bands. However, you can see the material does not look great on the band. It is clearly crooked if you look close. Obviously most people won‚Äôt notice but it does bother me as I think it makes it look cheap."
3.0,"The dress is nice. Material isn't quite what I was expecting, I was hoping for something a little softer. Also, the flowers are more of an off-white/cream than a white. Not quite what I wanted. The length is good for me(size S). I'm 5'2 and can wear it with flats."
3.0,Color fades after a while and hard to clasp
3.0,very small. toddler size
3.0,a little too tight to fix on tie without a good deal of effort
3.0,Such a comfy and cute dress. I‚Äôd give it five stars but I ordered burgundy and they sent me a red one and it‚Äôs way short and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10
3.0,"Not bad. No leaking, fit snug.<br /><br />Oddly distorted vision under water.... though fine out of water. Maybe because the lens are curved?"
3.0,"Arrived dirty, like it had be worn :("
3.0,Its very small and tight on my head. I don't usually have any problems with hats fitting.
3.0,"I wanted so badly to like this bra. I like the design, the extra strap on the bottom and the adjustable hooks. I fluctuate between DD and DDD and even though I could squeeze the girls in this bra, I tried some light jogging and my everyday bra has better support. I would recommend this bra if you are a C or below, but I just don't feel like it supports the larger cups well enough. It is well made though and packaged nicely. Just didn't work for me."
3.0,Very nice but Received damaged
3.0,this coat size runs smaller than expected
3.0,"The multi card feature is great, but it is too bulky for me (too much pressure on the derriere).  Makes a great storage container for my most frequently used cards."
3.0,These are lovely soft pajamas but... the sizes are not accurate. If you are normally a Large then order 2XL as they run very small. Also the material is so light that nipples are front and center. A little embarrassing.
3.0,I found them hard to use.
3.0,Just fashion
3.0,I ordered according to the size chart. L/XL  couldnt even get them on my feet.  reordered a 3XL  lets hope they fit.  How to return is a question. No papers inside at all.
3.0,Not exactly like the image but it‚Äôll do.
3.0,"The pockets make you look larger. Never wore it and just ended up donating it.  Cute dress, but pocket make your hips look big. Good price and would probably work, if I could have pockets removed."
3.0,Bag is nice size. Coolee attached was the bad part.. it leaks! Doesn't keep things.cool
3.0,"The sizing/material info is inaccurate:<br />These are NOT pre-shrunk cotton tees. They are Gildan 100% heavy cotton. Those things shrink A LOT. If I knew this was a Gildan heavy cotton, I would have ordered a larger size. Instead, I will have a shirt that will show my bellybutton after the first time I wash it.<br />Anybody who is making their shirts with Gildan heavy cotton, you need to disclose that information right up front."
3.0,Nice looking.  Too tight and not much warmth.  A lot of catchy end threads inside.
3.0,"I bought this guy to replace my original NATO Band, and was slightly disappointed by the limpness of the band, as well as the lack of a few metal loops the oringal had. Otherwise, it looks great and is comfortable."
3.0,Very basic fit and super sheer
3.0,"Love the material and its well made, but the length is a little short short for a long dreess, im 5""4 the length is about between my ankle and calves"
3.0,I wasn't able to use this. Not true to size. I would recommend ordering a size up.
3.0,"Not what I expected,  it's worth the price but don't expect anymore than that. Not as nice as it looks online."
3.0,"They are a little heavier than I expected.  One earring has a bit more difficulties clasping, and once it is, it's a little tricky to actually remove.  Overall, they are a really good product."
3.0,Very cute but after two washes they are already looking faded and a bit worn üòï
3.0,"I LOVE how this bra looks. It's also comfortable. Thick enough to offer coverage without being stiff or bulky. However, it is not very good at wicking sweat from your body. The material that extends down beyond the elastic band around the ribcage is flattering but also tucks in under my chest when working out and obviously turns darker when wet. Not too much of an issue under a shirt (though it was a bit uncomfortable and I got cold after my workout) but it may not be the look you want if only wearing the bra. The support is also on the lighter side in my opinion. I'm planning to use just for light pilates/yoga/stretching and not running or cycling as intended."
3.0,"Isnt built very well, has decent sound quality but no isolation. Overall, you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Very cute and looks like the picture. But if you are over a c cup, expect nip slips with any type of movement. This is a ""take photos then change into something else"" swimsuit."
3.0,"I went with my normal size large, but I should have sized up. It looks awkward and the space between the third and fourth buttons gaps open. The material is thin, so I'd want to wear something under it for that reason, too. Otherwise, it's comfortable. It just doesn't work for me."
3.0,"Decent watch added to my collection, Costco 39.99."
3.0,Beautiful but the zipper is very poor quality. I was unable to wear it because of the zipper and didn‚Äôt have the time to take it to a tailor. Great price and worth it if your are okay with investing in a tailor and a new zipper.
3.0,Some of them dont have a tight latch and fall out ive lost 3 this way... like the designs... You get what u pay for and these are cheap and Cheaply made
3.0,Maybe dry fit but not compression.  Works ok as undershirt
3.0,"Product runs small, tight in the arms. No stretch to fabric"
3.0,If you're tall this runs short. Otherwise nice color very affordable and good quality.
3.0,Nice and soft but I ordered an XL and it doesn't even cover my entire belly
3.0,"I ordered the green, but the color isn't like in the pic. It's more of an Army/olive drab green that isn't terribly flattering."
3.0,"The design and quality are great for the prize, but one of the two I ordered was a kids size!"
3.0,"The design it lovely, however the material should have not been the stretchy type.  To me the material does not fit well with the design."
3.0,"Cute dress, and loved the color, just wish it was a little lower cut."
3.0,"Loved how this watch looked with it's clear insides so you can see the workings. Too bad this watch had some mechanical problems that caused the internal gears to lose grip and spin mindlessly, never actually spinning the hands of the watch. Maybe it was just mine but the lack of quality made me regret buying this watch, even if it looks unique."
3.0,For the price product isn't the best quality.
3.0,Top is not as long as it looks in picture. Material is thin and it looks cheap. Color is vibrant and size is true to fit.
3.0,Medium was skin tight and large was huge on top.
3.0,They look very pretty but i cant wear them they cause me allergies i wich is odd the barbells i have on are also made out of surgical steel and are fine
3.0,"After having used a less expensive pair, we purchased these safety glasses. Of importance to us was the non fogging feature. Fact is, that this goggles fog just like the inexpensive pair. Very disappointed. The benefit is that they‚Äôre very clear and do not obstruct vision."
3.0,"I love these hats. The quality of the hat fantastic. However, the picture does not represent the beanie I received. I encourage Amazon to update the picture of the deep navy to accurately depict the color. I‚Äôm currently debating whether I will return."
3.0,"These are well made, but they are not for the well endowed. Without being graphic, there was just no way that sleeve was going to accommodate myself."
3.0,"SO CUTE! Just highly disappointed in how untrue to size they truly are! Bought my typically size bc most reviews said they were true to size, and they are far from it!"
3.0,The size said large. I'm a size 10 and it was waaaay too small for me.<br />Good fabric and design.
3.0,The photo gray properties are less than I expected. Other self darkening lens that I have became darker when outside.
3.0,"These are useless to me, way to small. They are sized wrong, that being said I still gave them a 3 because they do seem to be made well and I think I would have liked the versatility of the shorts. But with a no return policy i got screwed so I will not buy again."
3.0,they will work.
3.0,"The color was as I wanted, but I ordered a medium assuming it would be fine but it was bigger than I wanted. The sleeves were looser in my arms where they should've been right, and the length is longer than I thought."
3.0,"It is VERY SHEER!!! It is basically see through, I had planned wearing it out for a date but instead using it as a cover up. The elastic around shoulders is really tight."
3.0,Cute but very see thru
3.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful blouse but it just runs a bit smaller than shown! But it‚Äôs very beautiful good material!
3.0,Very cute and soft  but FRUSTRATED that buying things on amazon one must buy at least 2 sizes bigger.  Sizes are not accurate at all.
3.0,"Fits close to whats expected, still a little small. Material feels thin and cheap. kind of concerned its going to fall apart on me sooner then later"
3.0,"These were not a success. Rather than looking arty and unusual, they were just thin, shiny, and a bit cheap-looking - which shouldn‚Äôt really have come as a surprise at $10 :-)"
3.0,"I like the size of the capes and that fact that they have ties so you can adjust according to client's size, but some of the capes were taped shut so I didn't get my full 20 capes"
3.0,I know it's stainless but it just feels to light and alittle cheap but it's really nice and a good price
3.0,"The saying that ""You get what you paid for"" is true.. I received the bracelets but was disappointed when both has a chip on the stones. I did not bother to  for the hustIe. I gave it 3 stars as they look pretty if you ignore the chip."
3.0,Very well made it will be better if does have the option to take the strap off and have molle compatibility
3.0,"-ve first - the neck of the back is too narrow and the inside pockets, whilst a good size, interfere with access to the main body of the bag as a result.  This has been a real nuisance hence 3*s<br /><br />+ve's - it is durable - I am very hard on my bags and this is standing up to the pressure excellently and after 2 months of moving house and being thrown all over the place, it still looks brand new.  AWESOME.<br />The outer pockets don't look like they will hold much but they are PERFECT - literally!  Any smaller and I'd have been in trouble.  I put 2 passports in one, (one with a cover), and my keys and other keys and and and.<br />I have short shoulders so straps fall off so I have no choice but to go across the body.  If I was thinner the length would be perfect, as it is, it is a tiny bit too short for my liking but my irritation is just for a tiny second as I'm using it as incentive to get back on a diet when life calms down."
3.0,The pearl cages were beautiful the downfall to this product was the purpose of these cages are for the pearls. The cages were either to small and the pearls didn‚Äôt fit or the necklace wouldn‚Äôt fit through the cage loop. We made the best out of it.
3.0,"I love the polka dot black one and the white cherry green one. I normally wear L or 14. These two fit perfectly, however, the red one which is my most favorite color is nowhere near a size L. The tag is L, but it's small. So apparently some of the colors are true to size but some aren't. It's so sad, but I have to return my most favorite color :("
3.0,"The crystals look really cheap.  I I knew, I would have not bought it."
3.0,I got them for my two children being the age of 3 and 6 and they were extremely large They looked so tiny in the image .
3.0,I liked how they look but the loops for the glasses don‚Äôt tighten enough. My glasses kept slipping out.
3.0,"I ordered according to the size chart, but it still came in a size or two too large for me. I'm going to try to exchange it and will update with results."
3.0,"I normally wear a 1-X in a Walmart plus size shirt. So, I ordered a 2-X in this one to be sure. It was for a 70's themed party, so the tie dye was perfect. it fit very tightly and was not flattering. I returned it. The color(blue) was very pretty and material nice. The shipping was very fast, and I would have had it in time for the party if it had fit better. Return was very simple thank you"
3.0,Its clear these are defective pieces. Some of my charms were missing pieces. Not very noticeable but when taking them out the pack and comparing to others in the pack its apparent. I spent 3 bucks for 25 charms. No complaints
3.0,"You can't see through them very well. I wouldn't not drive with them on! They're good for the beach or river, something like that."
3.0,Cute but the bow should be secured to the bathing suit and not all weird and falling out
3.0,"This is almost cute. I have two main issues with it - the neckline was HUGE. The dress itself was a bit big for me, but I think even a smaller size would've had the same issue. Second, it's pretty short at a few inches above the knee (and I have really short legs). I would've basically needed to wear it with tights to make it work-able. The Peter Pan collar is cute, but much larger than it looks in photos."
3.0,"Perfect graduation gift. Great price, I was expecting it to be bigger"
3.0,"Not the absolute best quality and looks a bit cheap up close, but overall, it does look elegent in the rose gold and I do love the style. I wear it a few times since I've bought it and have had complements each time."
3.0,I liked the dress; waistline not as expected
3.0,Not the size I expected.  Probably one size larger.  Sent them back.  Could have worn them either socks but not what I wanted to do.
3.0,Nice compression and we'll made.  Some of them come up over my knee and some not even to the knee.  Not sure what happened there.
3.0,"After a couple of uses of these lens I thought they have been great. I have noticed lately that the lens has some blemishes that don't appear to be washable. They appear to be in the craftsmanship of the lens that makes them that way, I don't see it affect my field of vision, but it does concern in regard to longevity of the lenses."
3.0,"Great shoes, incredibly narrow. I had many pairs of these when I was younger and they fit fine, but these were such a squeeze that I could not wear them for more than an hour or two and less if I was walking any significant amount. The provide absolutely no arch support whatsoever, but that really is to be expected with a canvas shoe like this. If they were available in a wide at a reasonable price, I would buy them in a heartbeat but I could not find that, despite great effort."
3.0,"size charts are totally off.  returned and ordered a replacement at the biggest size available, I'm  6'1&#34;, 185 w/ a 42 chest - XL didn't even come close.  But the material and reflective tape are cool.  I'll post on the replacement's fit, form & function."
3.0,"I ordered this dress for a wedding I'm in. I sized up two sizes just in case and I'm glad I did however the dress needs some work. The neck is tight so I'm glad I ordered up. The top is too big, the waist is right and the bottom is about 5 inches too long. The color is pretty and you don't need a bra and you won't see any underwear lines. My biggest advice is order a size or two up then get it altered to bring in the areas that are loose."
3.0,The details are has defined as the one in the picture
3.0,"Product recieved was not as pictured.  The size and color were correct. But the pjs pictured were long sleeved and scoop neck. The pjs received were 3/4 length sleeves, V-neck, and has lace on the end of the sleeves and in the V-neck. I wouldn't have ordered them if I had seen lace in pictures. Lace is itchy to me. They are going to be birthday present for my mom, so we will see if she minds the lace or if I need to return them."
3.0,"This mask is well-made and had all the features I've been looking for. I'm a teacher and wear a mask for a good bit of the day. However, it's a very SHORT mask. If I pull it down to my chin, it doesn't completely cover my nose. I gave it to my 14 YO daughter--it fits her. So, in essence, this mask fits teens. Or a small adult face. Wish they had sizes."
3.0,Size ran smaller than expected but I do like the fabric
3.0,Order up like 2 sizes on this
3.0,"Son bonitos pero Env√≠an mal la talla, compr√© U.S. 9 y me enviaron US 7... pienso que env√≠an la talla que corresponde a EU :("
3.0,The ones I received ran smaller than any of the other nurse mates socks that I own.  Don‚Äôt know if a fluke or maybe you should size up...
3.0,"For a so called premium brush the bristles keeps falling out as your using it. It will leave bristles all over the shoe, microfiber cloth and table. Cleaning solution  works okay but felt like it was half full so maybe I got a dud. It cleans maybe 70% of the shoe. BUT  I ENJOY THE SMELL AND LIKE THE TRAVELING CASE. The microfiber cloth works as it should."
3.0,"Dress fit tighter on top, more than I liked."
3.0,"I ordered it the first time in a small. They sent an XL. Has an amazon rep do a replacement order and to make sure it‚Äôs a small. Got it and once again, an XL. Had to return both. Cute shirt, decent quality but just can‚Äôt get the right size sent, so returned and not reordering. Good luck on trying to get the size you want!"
3.0,"Ordered this pin with expectations of wearing to a holiday party. However , the pin is smaller than I expected, too small for my need, will give to my granddaughter."
3.0,"The outfit is cute.  However the skirt is strips of tulle tied onto a piece of elastic.  It's annoying to keep them all going in the same direction. However, she won't be wearing it more than once. I thought we could pair the skirt with other tops, but it's too cheaply made. Still, it made for cute birthday pictures."
3.0,Great for gifts but honestly not my style.
3.0,"I got the 4x 6 pk. For my husband and he loves them alot but only 2 out of the 6 pairs had a pee hole which is a bummer, he wears knee braces on both knees & brace goes over  underwater on legs so her can't pull them up. Why no hole to pee ?"
3.0,"Shoes fit as expected, but the look to wide, not really satisfied with them"
3.0,"Runs very small, order 2 sizes up. If you have big arms, this is not for you."
3.0,The bag looked nice but didn‚Äôt have a top zipper to close the contents in the bag.  I returned the item.
3.0,"The hat is nice and soft, but the chin strap leaves a lot to be desired. My daughter is 2.5 years old, and the strap hangs a couple inches below her chin. It never stays Velcro'd together and it seems like her ears are always exposed when playing outside. The mittens are thick and warm, but she has no dexterity in them and complains when she has to wear them. This set is great just to head out, but they don't work well for playing in."
3.0,Fits great. A little disappointed when I hand washed and the buttons came off. Needed to reattach the buttons anyway since they weren't aline properly.
3.0,Really thin and easily broken
3.0,The material isn‚Äôt moisture wicking and it is very complicated to figure out to put on. It‚Äôs okay but I wouldn‚Äôt buy another one.
3.0,"Not exactly was I was expecting, but looks great with a thin belt!"
3.0,Very pretty. Nice big stone. Color is prettying
3.0,The top part doesn't fit right. Too small everything from waist down is perfect.
3.0,This is a really cute headband but it is tiny! It barely fits on my 5 year olds head I had to stretch it just to get the button to close. I would love this if it fit me!
3.0,"The shirt is so cute that‚Äôs why I am keeping it. Not very stretchy tho, need toned arms. As far as the skirt maybe because I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô0 it is very long for me, though most skirts on amazon fit me well.  I am going to get it tailored. If you have long legs this outfit is for you."
3.0,"Kinda cute, but got it wet and it fell apart."
3.0,My son loves them but they're way too big. I bought the same size he wears in all his other shoes and they are at least a size or two too big.
3.0,I felt like the top pushed my boobs apart but the top fit well. The bottoms fit as expected but still a bit small. I was hoping they were truer to size.
3.0,"I've been trying to find a hat that looks decent on me for awhile. I'm 61 & just about totally bald on top. There are 2 issues I wanted to address:<br />1. Sunburn in the summer<br />2. Appearance; my forehead really looks better covered up (I used to use bangs, but now I have no hair!)<br /><br />I've tried & reviewed 4 hats & several beanies through Vine. My #1 favorite is the ""Cotton Flat Cap Ivy Gatsby Newsboy"" from this same manufacturer & also available on Amazon. While this one is #2 out of the bunch, it's a pretty distant #2.<br /><br />The appearance is a bit too ""good old boy""/""Nascar"", etc for my liking, & while I've never measured my head, the hat is too small on me (the other hat from the same manufacturer fits fine). The listing I selected this hat from to review stated ""M/L"".  From the product page, I think the buyer is supposed to be given a choice. I don't know what size I received. I would GUESS medium.<br /><br />If you like this look & have a small head, it's ok, but just ok imo."
3.0,"This review is specifically for the ""coffee"" version. Differences in monitors and lighting is one thing, a completely different color is something else!  Actual color was more of a yellow ""mustard"".  Very frustrating because otherwise it seems like a good product, but it does run somewhat small.  The page said to size down if you're between sizes...don't do it! Order your normal size or size up if you're between sizes.  I ordered two, one coffee, one dk. gray but both L which was tight, returning both. Might try an XL in the gray."
3.0,"5'8&#34; 160 lb male. I normally wear an A1 gi but decided to go with the A2 and shrink down, fits pretty well but the kimono and pants are extremely stiff and made with a scratchy material unlike another more well known gi that I have which is much softer, even with the rip stop material. For an extra $20 or so, I would recommend saving your money and buying a more well known brand."
3.0,"I like the charm bracelet, but hate the clasp, it keeps undoing other than that its very pretty and inspirational. It makes a simple and cheap gift with a message! comes with a gift box decorated and all, with satin touch inside. Good for teachers and nurses and co-workers (there are several other charms to pick from)"
3.0,"This sock isn‚Äôt great at all. When you put it on, the Boston terriers stretch out and are not nearly as noticeable. All you see is the white fabric throughout the puppies. Not cool at all. There‚Äôs also a white line where the sock was folded in packaging which shows while wearing it. For the price, I could have had 3 pairs of dress socks I‚Äôd wear for a long time. I am sorry, but wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
3.0,"Style and looks are okay, but the hat seems too small for may head. This one size fits all is on the tight side.<br />Sides are a bit shorter than i would like."
3.0,"I'm 5'4' and 127 and ordered a medium and I usually wear a medium.  I really liked the fabric weight, color (charcoal gray) and softness. However, the cut was too slim fitting in the hips and too long in the torso for my shape.  I considered keeping it and wearing it up at my hips but then the pockets fold open, plus...there was a hole in one pocket - which was disappointing for $99!  I do wonder if a large wound hang better around my hips but then it would probably be too big everywhere else.  I may order a large to try.  I sent the medium with the hole in the pocket back."
3.0,Cheap material. Didn‚Äôt last long.
3.0,Order the next size bigger than you usually do
3.0,Nice fabric but a little to small
3.0,Charms are nice overall except the ones with the part to attach to the shoe came off during shipping.
3.0,Nice purse. A little small
3.0,"Comfy, great fit, but see through"
3.0,I love the colors but still big for me. I will have to take them up so it won't roll around my arm.
3.0,Our nanny loved it. It has very small writing but she was able to read. Nice wording
3.0,"thin material and cheaply made, somewhat large and loose in areas."
3.0,"Looked ok. Some of the stitching is not correct.  Filling is lose.  Just appears to not be up to North Face's quality, even though the price was right.  Guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,My wife loved the style and material but unfortunately it was too small for her.
3.0,Shirt is nice but the color is not the same as what‚Äôs shown.
3.0,"This isn't really a slim wallet. It can actually get pretty bulky. I found it useful because it has a lot of space for cards, but that only encourages bulkiness."
3.0,Pearls are plastic and not fresh water. Looks good tho.
3.0,"Feels cheap, but they are cute."
3.0,"It is soft and i think it looks nice, but it's not extra long and it curls at the edges which can be annoying. I think it's overpriced for what you get, but i'm going to keep it."
3.0,Thin material didn't like it was a crop top
3.0,It‚Äôs okay I guess
3.0,One of them came a little wonky but they serve their purpose. If you have small lips like me they won't look as realistic. I went a whole few hours with them in and it wasn't so bad but I wouldn't recommend wearing them for so long since they do hurt after awhile.
3.0,cute top but it does fit somewhat small
3.0,It‚Äôs a good price but it‚Äôs heavy and you have difficulty to put together and take off
3.0,Truly not really comfortable plastic like shoes but nonslip when there wet they r not comfortable I hate the sound it makes to and makes when I am out of the shower makes this  squeezy noises that I can't really handle but other than that the shoes a perfectly good and fine.
3.0,"These ran smaller than they should, did not fit who I bought them for, so gave to someone who could use them, not the best quality."
3.0,Its big.
3.0,What is disappointed in some of the character earrings - and those were the ones my daughter really wanted to wear :(
3.0,"A little on the small, should have ordered the next larger size. Like the design though."
3.0,"Cute, but definitely way too sheer. Make sure to get matching color tank."
3.0,"I ordered up a size due to having more of a pear shape figure and bigger breasts.  The bottoms fit  a little large but not too bad, although not as tummy controlling as I would of liked.  The top is way too large, and does not have any support at all. That is the reason that I will be returning this!<br /><br />I probably could of sized down 1 size, but  I had read the previous reviews and got a little scared.  It's  a beautiful suit, but it is very cheap and very thin."
3.0,"It's bigger & pinker than I expected, but it is ok."
3.0,I ordered two of these bracelets.  The first one looked exactly like the picture.  I have worn it for a month now.  I am not exactly what it is suppose to do exactly but I know I have not gotten as tired this last couple of weeks.  I ordered the second one for my grand daughter.  It does not have the white bead nor does it have the spacers between the beads and the beads are much larger.  It did not come with any papers telling about the beads.  Very disappointed in the 2 order.
3.0,Purchased for a Kentucky Derby party and I was envied by other attendees.
3.0,Fairly good quality overall. i will admit the chain is fairly weak such as you were to get it caught on something it would break fairly easily.<br />the eye itself seems to be just flat out a piece of paper. but for the price it is an amazing buy!
3.0,"The color is fine, fits perfect. Just don't care for the feel of jersey. Glings to body when sweating... uncomfortable."
3.0,Fabric is too thin not quality material so shirt looks cheep on .
3.0,"This is a really attractive ombre in a very lightweight material.  I like the offset in the dark color; it's in style and very flattering.  Unfortunately, it's too small for me."
3.0,I usually wear an XL because I'm a size 16 but when I tried it on it was a little too tight so I'm actually ordering the next size up. I'd rather have it loose than too tight.
3.0,"sizing is good. Really pretty stone, but, gold comes off and it turns silver. No green skin/ ugly color, but all my other rings r gold so it looks weird. If they could fix that I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. I‚Äôd still buy again honestly bc of price"
3.0,Very cute but runs small. Had to return it.
3.0,Not the material I expected.  Reminiscent of a nightie. I kept it but it's much more casual than I thought.  Appears quite worn after a couple washes.
3.0,I bought the boot size 9 but the boots are way bigger than a 9 for sure. It says 9 on them but they aren't size 9 lol.  Other than that their nice waders.
3.0,With so much hair in the back of your head its heavy
3.0,"Good lasting material, stretch waist for comfort and looks nice too."
3.0,Nice coat but was too small through my shoulders so I had to return it
3.0,Like it but expected it to be bigger.. you know pocket watch sized.. it was the size of a quarter.
3.0,It's super cute but the band is SO tight.... I wish the maker would read the reviews and adjust as needed. I've read it was too tight since 2018
3.0,"its a bit short, works as a good headband, but not anything else"
3.0,"I'm on the fence. I ordered an XXL based upon the sizing chart. It would've fit much better had I purchased an XL or even a L. I like the dress, I do, but...I don't like the fact that there are no belt loops to hold the fabric belt in place. I typically wear it with a black belt that has a buckle, just because it stays in place a little better. I like this dress, but...I wouldn't order it again in any other color. Since I'm in the process of losing weight, I will likely end up giving it away since it will probably be even bigger than it is now."
3.0,"The jersey came with original tags, ok packing, everything was goo until I turn it over to see the name ""Rodgers"" and the letter ""E"" has somo residual green glue or something from the marking or I don't know really what happened but it's not dirt and doesn't come off."
3.0,The size runs smaller than expected.  Order one size larger then normal
3.0,Fits my daughter well but stitching is flawed on the right side under her arm. Sending it back in hopes of getting one that goes through quality.
3.0,"The coat is very nice but it runs smaller than Medium. The snaps don't stay fastened without the zipper being zipped! I would return it for an exchange, but I am hesitant because I don't know how the Large may fit. I washed the coat before I wore it once and it dried very quickly. The faux fur collar was removed at once and will probably never be used."
3.0,"It was a nice set, we used it for Flower Girl ( wedding) gifts. But one set was missing the earrings, so had to re-order a replacement."
3.0,Not bad depending on how you are shaped. Bought an xl thinking that it would fit my 34ddd breasts. The top was to small and the bottom was huge . I  sold it to my coworker  who is a B cup with a larger behind and she loves it.
3.0,I really love this shirt but it is sewn in a way that makes the Hem roll and makes it look kind of messy
3.0,This one looks very nice but is super tight. Be aware and buy a size up.
3.0,"These were not mint green, they were turquoise, still pretty, but not what I wanted. Wore them anyway and the back fell off one on the first day. Disappointed."
3.0,"These straps do not fit the Omega Seamaster without modifications. I am experienced watch collector and had extreme difficulty installing the buckle side of strap and had to modify the long side with toe nail clippers to fit. I returned first set to see if it was a flaw. Second set was identical hence modifying to fit. Might fit a Submariner, I don‚Äôt know"
3.0,It‚Äôs just a little loose when tightened the whole way.
3.0,"This shrunk at the first wash, can no longer wear"
3.0,"Me quedo bonita, pero la tela no es buena calidad."
3.0,I purchased this for the CMA Fest but the strap was fraying by the end of the week. I'm now afraid to use it for thinking it will break next time.
3.0,"Luckily I am able to sew so I was able to put the petticoat back together, but in many places the tulle was pulling off of the underskirt and there were many loose threads. This is still an okay petticoat though once I fixed it. The volume works really nicely."
3.0,"The shirt was described as a sweatshirt, but it was not. It was a long sleeve light weight shirt. The colts were pretty, but not as bright as they appear."
3.0,They fit okay but not as well as the women‚Äôs reggae sandal that I usually buy. Definitely NOT worth 40 extra bucks üòè
3.0,"Fits very small. The rubber over the nose can be uncomfortable and squish the skin around the eyes. Even after removing the chin strap and adding some size to the eye holes, it was still a very tight fitting mask. Fun accessory to have, less fun to wear."
3.0,Good product.  Shipping was quick and on time. The only thing that I had an issue with was that one of the lenses were popped out and I had to have my boyfriend fix them. Luckily he could and now they are working good for me. Just a little disappointed that they needed to be fixed before I could wear them.
3.0,"This is a beautiful and flattering full coverage hat. I love the colors and floral print. It has a couple of issues. The drawstring clasps on the hat itself are only on one side, since the hat is big on me I cannot wear the hat with the floral side up because there are no clasps to attach the drawstring :( I have not worn to beach yet, so Im unsure how it will fare on a windy day. But the flap itself has some sort of wire in it that allows you to shape and bend as you wish. A great feature. I have a smaller head so it's big but very wearable and stays in place with the drawstring."
3.0,"My daughter wore these for a competition dance and they didn‚Äôt last through the whole season before we started having issues. The location of the button is difficult because it rubs on the ankle and it is easy to bump while they are wearing them. We put corn pads around the button and that helped. Some of the lights would light up the wrong color and one shoe stopped working all together. We had to buy a second pair just so we could finish the season. They looked great and were really fun, I just wish they would have lasted longer."
3.0,"I believe price point should play a role in reviewing a product. This is definitely at the low end of the price spectrum so my expectations weren‚Äôt very high.<br /><br />The pros: cute and the red really pops. Large capacity with quite a few pockets to organize items. Many of the pockets are either clear plastic or mesh so you can see contents at a glance. Zipper seems that it will last.<br /><br />The cons: I purchased this for a cosmetic organizer but this is definitely better suited to larger items. Smaller scale (pencils, lipstick, mascara) get easily jumbled and hard to find.  There is little structure to this bag. When full, it pooches and sags in the middle. There is only a small handle on top sewn to the outside fabric of the zippered cover, I‚Äôm sure this would quickly fail if picked up and carried often (while loaded) by this handle.<br /><br />I would say this is best for short term travel or for lighter weight but large scale items. Maybe hair and wig care products? It is sort of working for me but I‚Äôm still looking for a longer term solution."
3.0,Martial feels like a costume. Fit fine though.
3.0,The robe is so pretty and fun to wear! It‚Äôs by far my favorite part of the set. The robe doesn‚Äôt have loops for the sash to hang onto but it‚Äôs easy enough to attach with some thread. The tie on the shorts is just for decoration it doesn‚Äôt actually tighten the shorts. The straps on the top are a little bit itchy but bearable.
3.0,I think the description says this could fit an infant up to a three year old. My son is 9 months and these were way too big for him. So my 3 year old will be getting them. Cute socks though.
3.0,"Love the material & fit of these tanks.  However, I have ordered 3xs & once did I get the style I wanted.  When you get the right size & fit order as many as you want right away!!  They are great!!!!<br />Wish I had more of the style that fit me as wanted..."
3.0,"The shorts fit....oddly. And the shirt also. They're comfy, I'll still wear them but yeah, wouldn't recommend or buy again."
3.0,It hugs the curves well! but poor quality.
3.0,Was like photo
3.0,"They're cute, but they scratched easily. Pretty small."
3.0,Runs small. Order a larger size.
3.0,"I was disappointed in the quality of the product. Bought it as a gift but only ended up giving him the cuff links. The image on the tie pin looked cloudy and cheap, so I did not include with the gift, which is a shame. Loved the image. Would even be willing to pay more if it was better quality."
3.0,"I am a very average large, ordered a large and it is much more like a medium.  Order one size up."
3.0,Not at all what I expected. It's nylon and runs small. Doesn't look like the picture of it.
3.0,Nothing negative to say. I ordered multiples of this ring until I know what finger I want to wear it on and what size is THAT finger.
3.0,The design is very nice. Much lighter than I expected considering it is stainless steel.  I think the women watch is much better than the males. I truly believe the males watch should be heavier and larger.
3.0,the fabric felt cheap and was not comfortable
3.0,"It runs big, and once it gets wet its almost see thru"
3.0,Make sure that you get the size you need because you can‚Äôt return this it cost $300 just to return it because it comes from overseas
3.0,"This belt is very cute. I got it for my junior bridesmaids to wear with their rompers. However, I wanted the darker brown that shows in the picture...and just as other reviews stated, the color is more of a light brown. We can make it work but I was disappointed that the product we received was not the same color as the product pictured."
3.0,The dress fits great but the material reminds me of a table cloth. I didn't return it in the time needed because I was moving but I donated the dress to a local career service for someone who needs interviewing clothes because the material was just not my style and I hope someone else will use it
3.0,Bad size... and paid X2 custom for that...i was not responsible and not commercial gesture.<br /><br />No good :<br />Not made in USA<br />Too small size<br />No commercial gesture<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />Shirt and pant are correct... just too small size
3.0,The dress is cute but super loose below the chest so it looks like maternity dress. I might actually use it as one when I am pregnant.
3.0,It's very light so feels a little cheap (which it was).
3.0,"I have a bigger wrist. So they are a lil snug. But, I like them. I really bought for my kids, since they like to wear stuff like this..."
3.0,"Beautiful colors, hasn't bled yet. My main complaint is the sloppy sewing in the shoulders/chest. It is sewn in such a way that the shoulders drop towards the collar bone instead of the other way around, causing it to fluff out by the chest/armpit, which is a concern since this is for a preteen! I managed to pinch it back with a quick fix of a ribbon tying the shoulder straps in the back, racer back style.  Mine might have been the odd one out but please be aware of it!"
3.0,Returned. Way smaller than expected
3.0,They are about an inch to short to comfortable reach from one ear to the other.
3.0,The earrings are nice but they are a bit smaller than expected.
3.0,Cute shirt but is short on me.
3.0,Works great but doesn't last.  Wore out too fast.
3.0,Needed a quality jacket to change up outfits. Fabric thin. Disappointed.
3.0,"Order your size. Or if you usually size a half size up, don't."
3.0,A little snug for the size.
3.0,No a√≠slan del frio
3.0,"I love the way these look but they are a bit too small for size. According to the size chart a 36B is a medium. Oddly my 3 pack had 2 medium & 1 XL. I tried on all 3, the mediums are a bit too small & the XL is a bit too big. So for a 36B I'm sure a large would be perfect. I didn't return them because after a few wears I'm hoping the mediums will stretch a little."
3.0,I like it except the pearl came out of its setting within a week. Luckily I found it in my bra and I reglued it in the setting
3.0,This dress fits a bit loose and is very see through
3.0,"Love the fit and look, but the fabric makes me sweat and itch."
3.0,"First of all, I like the hat. Its cool and feels well made. The ribbon on the side was hot glued on, and so out of the box was already coming off. Speaking of the box, mine was smashed. That resulted in the dome of the hat being caved in and a crease was formed on the side of the hat. Also, the hat is not as tall as it seems. Its really only about 3 1/2 inches deep, so its not going to stay on your head in a slight breeze. Im just really disappointed in the condition I received it in, definitely not 55$ dollar treatment. I personally plan on trying to replace the one I got because its really just sad the way it creases to one side now."
3.0,"I really like the shirt, little wider than I expected but it does fit"
3.0,baggier and shorter than I expected. Will most likely return for XXL Tall. Vert comfortable though.
3.0,"So I bought this on a whim with a Amazon recommendation. It was super affordable and I like the fabric. But the waist hits me at empire which I didnt like. Although it fits, I'm not thrilled with how it looks on my chest because the neckline is super high. But I love the fabric and think it would be cute on a smaller person. I'm gonna alter it to a skirt so I can keep the nice fabric and cute pattern."
3.0,"These were bought as Xmsa gifts bc of teh novelty effect and how cute they were.THey are made of a nylon material, like a spandex on the outside, so yes, staining is inevitable.  My initial realction was this little &#34; breather&#34; insert near the foot arch, that thing is sharp as sh*T, I think when your foot in in there, it pushes the buckle out so you don't get cut but that should never be part of the design.  I can't  feedback on wearing them since it's not Xmas yet, but the packaging is so cute, it comes in a milk carton.... so unique, I would buy it as a Bday gift for others just out of novelty."
3.0,"You have to put them in backwards, not like the picture, these earrings are ok"
3.0,"Was originally sent an insert with the incorrect amount of windows. I was then sent a replacement with the correct number of windows, but with the plastic insert piece located on the wrong side, however, I was able to make it work. Customer service was very helpful (all problems were manufacturer related.)"
3.0,"Not for small frame glasses. These are more for medium-sized frames. These are OK. They do a great job of cutting the glare (yay polarization). I tend to prefer a darker lens, but these work good enough. I do like the look of the frame a LOT. Overall, if you have very small-framed glasses, you might want a different pair."
3.0,cant tell if this is a men or women's shoe and you wont know till you get it sent mine back shoe to big
3.0,"Great material and durable for the price. Ordered for my husbands Halloween costume. He‚Äôs not a large man slim hands and gloves fit good. We ordered mask & gloves as a set so sent both back since mask was toooo small.<br />Other than that, great value!"
3.0,"The face on the mask is larger than a regular face. I wanted something to look like a normal size face. Unfortunately, the face is large and makes you look cartoonish."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, would have liked it to fit, perhaps a few darts from bust to waist.  Otherwise, I am very pleased."
3.0,"Really happy with the overall quality of this dress. But when the reviews say it runs small, believe it! On the bright side, it fit my 11 year old daughter beautifully! üòÅ"
3.0,"You‚Äôll definitely need to wear a strapless bra for he top and a half slip for the bottom; the dress‚Äôs lining is too sheer. Also, the lining is easily a foot shorter than the flower overlay...much different than shown in the picture. I bought a size 6, as another customer indicated the dress top runs small. Problem is, the top‚Äôs okay but then the waist is too large, and buying a size 4 would have meant the waist was fine but then the top would‚Äôve been too small. I‚Äôll have to get this tailored to make it look right."
3.0,When i received the keychain it already had little bumps of rust on it. I like it though.
3.0,Back comes off easily
3.0,not too
3.0,Runs smalls even got the largest they had would gave 5stars had it been bigger
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, but I have to wear a tank top underneath. Shirt is see through."
3.0,"The earings are pretty.....but the backs don‚Äôt fit, the holes are too small. Luckily, I had some spare backs from old earrings, but this is just a poor product having to pay for something you need to augment with an addition before you can use it. Disappointed."
3.0,"Good quality pants but way way way too large. I know i‚Äôm small, usually a size XS so i purchased a Small and they fit me like a M or even a Large"
3.0,Ok shoe tight fit in the bend part
3.0,beautiful but too smallit fits as if it was a small. i asked for ex large....
3.0,"I think due to the holidays it arrived much later than anticipated. When received, the stones don‚Äôt really align, the top one protrudes further out than the rest and another stone looks tilted. Looks a little cheap but I guess for the price it would."
3.0,More blue green than pink purple green
3.0,So I returned it. But it was good quality!
3.0,"I love the dress but, it‚Äôs too small the sleeves are a bit snug even though the dress is lovely."
3.0,Material little cheap.<br /><br />Too tight in the sleeves. But it's okay if I lose weight.
3.0,"This dress is great, however, in the middle where the wire is, there is some fabric hangover and it pops out and looks a little funny. As long as that is tucked, everything is great! Length and material are both great!"
3.0,"It's pretty, however it's much bigger in person and looks weird on small ears."
3.0,"This mask fits tight but seems a little small for my face. The ear loop is elastic, but not enough to fit comfortably over my ears without bending them forward, which makes the mask prone to come off. It is a one size fits all product, which might be great for those with smaller faces than mines. For mr, it is an uncomfortable fit and do not represent good value. The craftsmanship is good and the mask is lightweight and durable. Comes with 3 in a pack."
3.0,Its super thin - so be ready to wear a cami under it
3.0,Did not like the material for the shirt
3.0,It's really pretty and look just luke it does on the model but it run 2 sizes too small.
3.0,good compression but leaves impressions in your legs where the decorative  weave is.
3.0,"Construction is ok.Design is interesting. Material very soft, comfy, but very thin what is kinda disappointing, I afraid it will be pulling easy. Sleeves are perfect for me, not tight and I am size 14/16 and I am 5'7&quot;..I bought black in XL and the look is tight, form fiting in front, loose in the back.So nothing even close to the loose fit on model..I will keep it and ware it with leggings, but it will not be my favorite tunic. Took forever until I receive it, so don't want to go through the return hassle. Will use it somehow, but in the end of the day it's cheap made tunic from China . It's too expensive for the quality presented."
3.0,"First of all they stay on my head well because they have good grip and are comfortable so I can wear them for long periods of time. I like the look and the case and bag that it comes with is also well made and looks great. The performance is also good, I use these a lot when driving around and they do a great job at making sure there is nothing distracting me while driving. The main problem I have with these is that they fit pretty tight and while that does not take away from the comfort it does leave some clear marks on my nose when I have them on for long periods of time which really pushes me away from this product."
3.0,"Runs big, is loose fitting and short. Don't dry it, it makes it shorter."
3.0,Nice quality but the sizing is way off. My 7 year old is a solid 6x so that‚Äôs what I ordered. They are only a little big on my 4 year old who wears a 4 T.
3.0,They're okay. After a month and a half already badly scratched up on lenses. Brown lenses are also very very dark to see through. Good price.
3.0,Works well in wet conditions but the weave is too loose to the wind blow right through it.  My 6 dollar one works just as well.
3.0,"Just okay, stones lose their luster after 2 days in"
3.0,This bra was okay.  Was not quite as I expected.
3.0,"Initially I loved this dress. It's so comfortable, very flattering, and the brown color goes nicely with everything. Unfortunately, after 2-3 wears, the material is already pilling. I'm so disappointed, because I was definitely ready to buy the dress in many more colors. But if I can't wear it more than a few times without it looking worn, I don't think I'll be buying it again."
3.0,The material if this shirt makes me think of a nighty or the CuddleDuds long johns. Not something I feel comfortable wearing to work. If it were a different material I would love it
3.0,"It doesn‚Äôt work for me. It looks very fake and hard to wear. The length is kind of problematic too, too short to appear like party jewelry."
3.0,Great quality but too wide for my pocket.
3.0,"When I ordered this, I ordered a womens slipper. At the time of ordering it, that was what the product said and in my order history, it says WOMENS slipper. I clicked the link to show my dad what I had ordered my mom for christmas and saw the headline said mens. Confused, I double checked my order and the order said womens. I contacted support and Amazon told me that sometimes when a product goes out of stock, sellers will shift products.<br /><br />So men, first, be warned that some of the reviews might be for a WOMENS slipper and women, be warned that some might be for a mens. This is just confusing and should not be a thing.<br /><br />That being said, the amazon seller assured me that the product I was delivered would be a womans slipper and so I tried to relax, as the slippers in question were already wrapped and under the tree.<br /><br />Come christmas day, my mother opens the box and sure enough, they are mens slippers. Luckily, they fit, but they rub at the side of her toe and caused quite a blister. She doesn't want to send them back, but I wanted to leave this review, as I'm very unhappy with this whole ordeal."
3.0,This definitely works for the new regulations at stadiums (NFL and college football) BUT it's a tad snug for an iPhone 6s plus and some of the rivets have disappeared/fallen off during the two times I have used it.
3.0,It doesn't fit well and is kinda itchy
3.0,Disappointed in the color. They are about four to five times lighter than shown in the picture.
3.0,I am conflicted about this dress. I bought it in hopes of using it for a Halloween outfit and still be able to use it as a normal dress for any other day. I ordered my size based on measurements and it was a bit loose in the chest and shoulder area. The color was as I expected and it did work well for my costume for work. However. The material feels just like a costume fabric so I am unsure how long I can make this dress last as just a daily type of outfit.
3.0,They are most definitely not for men size 9. Can‚Äôt even fit women size 7.5
3.0,To small to purchase
3.0,Cute but not good quality. One of the straps broke while I was putting it on. I didn't have difficulty donning it so it shouldn't have broke. I'm 5'4 and 135lbs. I got the 4/6 which is my normal size and it was too big.
3.0,"Runs very large.  Like the green color, but sizing is way off.  It's huge on me.  I will sew the bottom do it's more tailored. As of now, it hangs on me.  Material is nice but thin. Not see through, but basically a light fabric"
3.0,For an xxl it was really too short. It would fit someone 5‚Äô 10‚Äù
3.0,"ok, so here's my review of this super cheap costume jewelry. If you pay this price and expect something amazing, you really need to adjust your expectations. :)<br /><br />It's costume jewelry- so it's not perfect. Up close you can see the &#34;stones&#34; don't line up with the &#34;settings&#34;, but from afar it looks great, and this will work perfectly for formal pictures with my niece. :)"
3.0,Much smaller than I exoected.
3.0,The product fits as expected but the material used feels very hot on your skin. I wore it running errands and it felt like my skin could not breathe. I love how it looks but I couldn't wait to take it off once I got home.
3.0,"The cup inserts are pretty much a joke, but the material is good quality. However it fits so tight I was in pain after wearing it for 8 hours.  Had to get my husband to help me take it off, which is now a joke for the rest of our lives.  3 stars because the material is good and the back is cute, but I won‚Äôt ever wear this again."
3.0,Looks great only bad thing is the lion head paint comes off within hours/days and leaves  green/black marks on your wrist.
3.0,another of my daughters orders. She loved it. the Clasp did brake. So she made one from sturdier clasp.
3.0,"Well made, very pretty material, and better quality than expected. Just wasn‚Äôt the right cut or fit for my body type, but would recommend for others to try it."
3.0,"UPDATE:<br />The original product listing was confusing, leading many to think these were the heated version.  I informed the seller and requested they update their listings, which they did quite promptly.  So, kudos to them.  I docked 1 star for that issue, and since they've fixed it I will give it the full 3 stars I rate these particular socks.<br /><br />ORIGINAL:<br />Product title reads:<br />""Heated Socks, Thermal Socks for Men Women, with APP Remote Control Electric Socks Rechargeable Battery 5000mAh Extra Thick Winter Warming Socks Fit for Outdoor Working Skiing Fishing""<br /><br />Item received is neither heated nor remote controlled electric socks.  These are just socks.  So, this review is limited to plain old socks.  I am not a fan of these socks, for their design, materials, or length.  Failing to be clear in their product description also costs them some stars.<br /><br />Bottom line: for the price and construction of the black&white&grey one size selection, they're fine and I would give it 3 stars - neither horrible nor great.  But I dock it 1 star for the confusing and incorrect product description.<br /><br />Personally, I would not recommend this to anyone I know, but if you're into these type of socks then they're okay.  They're certainly cheap enough.<br /><br />So, I will give it 2 stars"
3.0,How do you take out links. No info with watch.
3.0,"These socks are cute and the lace makes my feet feel pretty. I like the no-slip padding on the balls of the feet and around the lining of the sock. That being said, these are NOT no show-- they come up past even my flats with more covering, like my TOMS. I have also noticed that the socks are not uniformly made-- one almost always shows less than the other, and I've tried 3 pairs so far. That's really weird and annoying to me, but for how cheap these are it's not worth returning. Will keep them and make do, but wouldn't buy these again."
3.0,They are not the fit I expected because of cut. I prefer the knit type from last year
3.0,to long for a little woman
3.0,I liked the fabric the fit just wasn‚Äôt for me.
3.0,They are A LOT smaller then I expected. And they bend easy. But they are cute. I am still going to give it to my daughter and her best friend.
3.0,"It definitely looks cuter in the pictures than in real life. I haven't yet tested it out for its sun-blocking functions, and that's all that really matters, but if you're thinking about this versus a more mundane looking sun hat, I might just go with the latter. The brim doesn't really fold up as nicely in the pictures."
3.0,"I will say I like the color, but I was very much looking forward to a long robe. It‚Äôs nowhere NEAR as long as pictured. It barely goes to my knees. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù. It‚Äôs standard or average length.<br />I do prefer this style of pocket. Nice color. Material feels soft but other than collar and cuffs- is very thin. Also- the robe belt keeps slipping. Never had that happen before. Also the sleeves are short. This is made for short and petite builds.<br /><br />I am 7 months pregnant, but have my original robe to compare with. I am fairly tall and long for a usually very thin (almost petite) build. This Robe is very short sleeved and no longer than average.<br /><br />Customer service was kind. They sent me an extra large which was about 6 inches longer. Still a good 12 inches above my ankles.  They said they worked with the manufacturer to ensure the ropes are now fixed or longer. So at least the customer service was very good. I upgraded my initial review to show the customer service .<br /><br /> Overall the robe is soft, slippery, pretty, good pockets, but you get what you pay for.  That said, I would say it‚Äôs worth the cheaper than average robe price."
3.0,Cute black cat necklace with a long chain so detailed thanks for great price and delivery
3.0,"Its okay..  the silicone slips over time so you have to readjust the hook so it's somewhat pointless..  However, I gave it a 3 star because I placed it on a toddler's eyeglasses and the temple tip could have been smaller than normal adult glasses.  Who know...3 star.."
3.0,Fit very large. The fingers were much too long for my 4.5 year old.
3.0,"The shape and fabric were okay, but the red bled into the white the first time I washed it and now it's red and pink..."
3.0,This bracelet is very pretty very tiny broke it and one day.
3.0,"Seems a bit cheap, but my daughter loves it."
3.0,"but we're using this as a Halloween costume. The lace detail is nice, but the tulle on the skirt is very stiff. This appears to be a one-time use quality, and the material is definitely not nice enough to be used for anything formal."
3.0,"Was a nice sweater, loved the material, but fits much larger than expected. I usually wear a medium and could have easily worn a small."
3.0,"I did not realize this shirt was made of rayon which reduces natural softness, absorbency, and looks cheaper than cotton. The quality of the cut is on the order of hospital scrubs and it looks like an old lady's shirt.  It is true to size and the colors are just as pictured so I will keep it but it is not as attractive as or comfortable as other cotton ombre shirts that I wear."
3.0,"Is not true to size at all, but nice material"
3.0,It runs a little small.  Is very soft and not heavy. Seam isn‚Äôt straight between pattern and solid fabrics.
3.0,Great quality and design. I wanted to wear it high waisted but it was still a bit too long even for that. It was tea length so I returned it easily for a refund. I'm petite 5ft tall so this may be a better item for someone taller.
3.0,I get lots of compliments Everytime I wear them and for the price don't expect your skin not to turn green because it will. I just wear them for a couple hours and take them off. They're cute enough to keep wearing but only for short periods of time.
3.0,The stone looks real. Not very interesting or pretty.
3.0,"I‚Äôm probably going to keep them, but dissatisfied with extremely tight they are."
3.0,Run small in size- waist adjustable instead of a belt would be better for kids
3.0,"These shoes are really cute but they run very narrow. I bought a size up to compensate for the width. Now that they have stretched out to fit the front of my foot they are too long. If I wear insoles with them though things improve, so that is what I plan to do. The sole also does not have any padding in it."
3.0,"Med TOO big--get small, It stretches and rubs brushes into your wrist. They should warn you!"
3.0,These pants are very well made and attractive but the XL are gigantic and<br />do not fit me like other XL pants I order online.
3.0,They're comfortable and adjustable. Keepers if your not worried about being sexy. They give arch support!
3.0,Nice boots for my son with the exception that they are coming apart where the boot and the sole meet already
3.0,I love these glasses but this is the second time I‚Äôve ordered yellow and gotten orange üòÇü§£ü•¥
3.0,I went to use one of them and it fell apart. I was so disappointed. I will send it back.
3.0,"I liked the size and design of the pack. I carried water, lunch, jackets, and other small things for myself and my daughter on day hikes on our Glacier National Park vacation.I found it convenient to have several compartments, and there aren't many other packs of this size and price range with a hip belt, which I consider essential. The frame does eat into the internal volume, but what was left was enough for my use. I am 6'' tall, weigh about 200 lbs, and was able to adjust the backpack so that it was comfortable to wear. When my 11 y.o. daughter tried it on, she complained that the shoulder pad mesh was too rough and was hurting her neck when rubbed against; she refused to carry it again afterwards.<br />The poor quality of the material used to separate the internal compartments is the downfall of this backpack.  After less than two weeks of use it started disintegrating at the seams. The threads just separated without any effort on user's part."
3.0,they okay for the price
3.0,"I really wanted to love these slippers but they are just too large. I wear and 8, and I'm swimming in the size 7-8 slippers."
3.0,"Nice colors. This fabric (unlike others I purchased from them) is quite stiff - like it's been starched. I just washed it hoping it would wash out and get softer, but it doesn't appear to have done so. Yet. I haven't tried ironing it. Pocket matches the background and blends into shirt. As the picture shows, it is cut straight up & down rather than flaring slightly for people with extra weight around the middle, but it looks nice."
3.0,"Its a great piece of clothing, warm, only if it fit me right. Beware this is for seriously overweight people. Please listen to me and size down if you are healthy"
3.0,"Took two months to receive. Quality is just ok.  There are large snaps on the shoulders that bug me, because you can see them when the sweater is not closed. You cannot see the snaps in the pictures. My hair also gets stuck on the snaps."
3.0,A bit scratchy and the wire poked out of the black one the second time I wore it ... really? They are very cute but not very comfortable...
3.0,"Not sure if these are the real thing, but nice quality.  The reason is because they were not shipped in a box, but a clear thick plastic bag that sealed.  They are a bit big, but we will shelve them until he can fit in them."
3.0,A bit to long on the ear. Good price and fast shipping though
3.0,"In the picture provided it gives the illusion that the hat is more structured and fitted. That is not the case. The hat is very flimsy and does not fit that great. The material is not bad, its just not what I was looking for."
3.0,"The strap was well made, but as I am on the larger side, the length of the strap was smaller than the one I was replacing. I missed the return window but I would say if your wrist in under 8 inches it is a solid buy."
3.0,i just want to try it because i got something similar but it is made of hard plastic and bigger but thinner so i always carry it in my pocket.i keep the se-loupe at home when i am doing something
3.0,Runs very small !!!
3.0,I loved the pants and thought they were super cute but they were much too small. It was more like a child's size than adult.
3.0,I received this watch but I think that you should have put it in a box. Even though it did not cost a lot I love money to buy it I still think you should look like it cost a lot.
3.0,"Pic shows it as oversized, IS NOT! Tiny and super short. Tig bitty ladies beware!!!"
3.0,"An ok pair of sunglasses.  Compare to those you would get at a gas station.  Mine didn't come with the reflective tint as in the photo, they came in just black."
3.0,The shoes are nice and comfy for my son but I did not get them in time for our vacation in Colorado. I ended up buying him shoes from Academy that served the purpose just fine. I was going to return these shoes but they don't offer free return shipping and shipping to China is same price as the shoes. I should have checked the shipping and return carefully.<br />Now I decided to keep them and pass them on to my nephews. These will not fit my son next year and our weather in Houston is too warm to even wear these in winter.
3.0,"Glasses are very cheaply made, but fashionable"
3.0,Very nice and gorgeous but.names not readable.
3.0,Very silky but the small was way too big for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 115lbs and I‚Äôm basically swimming in it. Would exchange for a smaller size but returning/exchanging takes more time than it‚Äôs worth. Probably will just add elastic myself and take in the sides several inches
3.0,Cute and looks like the pictures but didn't last long before they started ripping and tearing.
3.0,Be sure to read all of the details about it. It is a little heavy. Makes a great scarf pin and hat pin.
3.0,Is nice but it changed the color second day on my neck ...
3.0,"When i received  the package, I had order two pair, one pink and one purple pair,  the top in the middle of the pink pair was bent down, so had to use something to push it up for a couple days for it to go back into the right shape and it is still bent a little bit! The shoes fit good and are cute, but the only thing we didn't like that I didn't see in the pictures or wouldn't have bought them, was the word Fashion in black bold across the strap, and since this is a toddler shoe I would think that a lot of people would put the strap down and use it to keep them on there child's feet, but when you do fashion is upside down! Not saying this is an actual problem some people may be ok with it and wanted to give a heads up, because it's black and bold and just is tacky if you have them in casual dress especially! They also attract dirt, my oldest has had a pair of white crocs brand and are easy to clean but she never really has an issue with dirt but for some reason my youngest normally doesn't have an issue with her other shoes like this with dirt attracting to them but these ones i have cleaned everytimeshe has worn them! It May just be the rubber decorations on them but not sure! Hope this helps someone make the decision rather or not to buy them! I know buying online can be tricky and just wanted to let anyone know the whole version of what they are getting! It may not bother some people the way it bothers me though! They are true to size, and we ordered the size bigger hoping they would last longer, and they don't run big like other brands of this style of shoe! I would have maybe returned them if we weren't going on vacation in a week of realizing her shoes from last year had a rip in them! But for the money they aren't a bad quality of shoe, I refuse to buy croc brand and pay that much for shoes for a 3 year old growing child, so I buy the off brands til they are old enough and slow down growing! We did notice that croc brand is upside down on the strap as well but it is printed in the same color of the croc not bold black on a light pink and light purple shoe and upside down when you put the strap down!"
3.0,I received my shipment promptly. The heel lights are not as bright as the ones I had before (another brand). Snug fit which is nice because when I run I hit my heels together and usually knock one off.
3.0,The stitching on the card pockets started to come apart after a year. Other than that I loved this wallet.
3.0,These look nice but I received what look like 2 different versions of this shoe. One is light with smooth leather and the other is darker with brushed leather. I know they are just for babies but they should still match. My baby is almost 8 months old and not a tiny baby and these are still quite large on her feet. She needs them now but won‚Äôt be able to stand in them without tripping for at least another month.
3.0,Size large runs a little bit small. I can use a x large .
3.0,I liked the color but it was not soft at all.
3.0,I have to be honest aviator glasses don‚Äôt always look great on my face shape. These are classic aviator style glasses and are lightweight and comfortable. Even though they didn‚Äôt flatter my face I did find them comfortable to wear. What I didn‚Äôt like are the lenses which have a weird 3-D glasses affect. I think that this caused me to have a slight headache after wearing them for an hour.  Many less expensive polarized glasses do you have the weird red 3-D effect. I am Magine this is why I found these glasses difficult to wear for a long time. I think these would be good for driving if there is a lot of sunlight and glare from the road. The nose pieces also left red marks on the side of my nose but all aviator glasses do that to me. I think that these are nice lightweight basic glasses but nothing super special.
3.0,Looks a little more pink or coral than red due to the white stitching.
3.0,"Not ""easy on"" - for a senior, nearly impossible to put on without help."
3.0,Bad Fit - Tight in the top & way too long.<br /><br />Disappointed. Lovely dress but it needed to be returned.
3.0,Value for the money was great. Looks great. Fits great. Just the battery pack fell apart when my son took it out of his backpack.
3.0,These pants are see through
3.0,Great glasses aside from leaving a mark on your nose if you wear extended amount of time
3.0,I'm normally a size XL on the bottom. These pants ran very tight thus hips and butt!
3.0,The shirt/dress is super cute but a bit even after drying. I've had to add a belt to make it look as if it fits properly.
3.0,"It‚Äôs a nice bracelet and it‚Äôs very easy to get on and off by yourself. It seems to be high quality in general, but my only complaint is the gold is starting to wear off after only having it for a few months."
3.0,I purchased this style because well.. they are comfortable. But this brand seems to made of thinner fabric than other brands I have purchased in past.
3.0,Th product itself is good quality.  However they need more than one size or the hardware needs to be modified.  These cannot be adjusted small enough for ladies riding boots.
3.0,Fit was not as loose as what appeared in pic.<br />Probably should‚Äôve ordered a larger size.
3.0,Pretty good except the wires are not in the correct sequence so I had to connect the green wire to the blue on my LED strip and the blue wire to the green on the LED strip in order to make it work...Make sure before you solder anything that the strip works correctly.
3.0,"These are very comfortable...I'm mean VERY...but, they get very dirty (I have the red). They tell you that they are machine washable, so I put in the machine...but they didn't come clean. I even washed by hand and nothing! So, I don't wear them much at all, which is a shame, because like I stated, they are VERY comfortable."
3.0,"Looks nice, but ran a little small. Also get super smelly after a few wears."
3.0,"Very easy to break when tightening on. Your ear, but it comes with what you see."
3.0,"Hat is super cute, but from the reviews I was hoping it would run small and fit my tiny pinhead.  It's too big, though, which makes it uncomfortable since it pushes my ears down and shifts around on my head. Only buy this if your head is average sized!"
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter. She likes the way it fits but the shirt smelled of smoke! Not sure why but I‚Äôm hoping just a wash will get it out. If not, I‚Äôll be returning the shirt."
3.0,"While the outside of the bag is very cute and worth the under $10 price tag, the inside is an unfortunate thin, gray, plasticy, smells-like-rubber fabric meant for keeping drinks & food cool, not as a purse. And I will have to iron the handles bc they are so creased. I will use it but wouldn‚Äôt gift it. The felt & canvas outside is pretty though! Hoping it gets me thru 4th of July ;)"
3.0,"Way too small for an adult face, it's about as thick as the typical halloween mask, uncomfortable, the color is dull and over a few lines, just not very good quality. Got what I paid for I guess."
3.0,Pants are see through. Not what I was expecting.
3.0,"These are exactly as pictured in black. Incredibly cute and stylish and very affordable. Why did I not give it 5 stars? Two reasons, the first one being that I felt like the sole of the wedge is slightly narrow and I had to pay attention to how I was walking so as not to tip over and the second reason is that the toe straps dig into my skin and hurt a lot after an hour or so of wear. I'm thinking that the placement of the thong is off and actually should be a little further forward. This is a shoe I would sit around to look cute in, it's definitely not suitable for all day wear. I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased honest review."
3.0,"The size said ""One Size Fits Most"".  I think it should say ""One Size Fits Most 5 Year Olds!""  It was way too small for my adult head.  I passed it on to my almost 3 year old granddaughter.  We have to clip the back for now to make it fit.  It is very cute.  But very small."
3.0,Difficult to put
3.0,"The quality of the items is very low for the price being charged, so I found that to be frustrating. My three-year-old son received this as a gift and he loves it. Unfortunately, the sizing on the vests and hats are probably more for seven to nine year old kids, so everything is enormous on my son. He has room to grow into it, of course, but I'm not sure the quality will last long enough for that to happen.<br /><br />Ultimately, it does get played with. I would've been happier with the purchase at a lower price point because it feels like a rip off.  Also, be sure to have a basket or two ready for all of the plastic junk that comes with each dress-up set. There are way too many of the small items and no system of organization for them. The company should scale back onnthe junk and increase the overall quality for the price."
3.0,"So, I think this romper would be cute on people who are very tall and slim, but it is not for short people.  It was huge and way too long.  If only I was six inches taller."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this sweater, however it was pretty different than the picture. Definitely runs a bit big and the color is very different than the color shown. With that said, I think the quality is pretty nice and it is very comfortable."
3.0,"Worn once, already pilling with runs"
3.0,Looking at all the reviews everyone was saying it runs large but in my case it was to big i wish i would have went down a size or got my size so a little disappointed and the fabric i wasnt to much a friend of but ig its ok its stretchy so im ok with that
3.0,"This is not 1 pair of earrings.....it is half a pair.  The pictures showing two led me to believe it was 1 pair.  The description says 1 piece, but I thought it meant 1 pair....wish I had bought  6 instead of 5."
3.0,"Sizes are off on the pips. They're too big. Google what the regulation sizes should be, 8mm, these are approx 13mm."
3.0,Super cute but too small for my suitcase.
3.0,This is an attractive bracelet but was disappointed in the lack of twinkle and bling. Comfortable to wear. The price was not comparable to its value in my opinion.
3.0,Not as thick as I wanted it to be
3.0,Loved the style but order up size
3.0,It is an okay necklace but really nothing special like some of the other necklaces I have purchased I gave it to my child
3.0,It's super cute but super tiny.
3.0,The eyes and mustache of the character had adhered to the plastic zipup bag .
3.0,Because the back of this earring is a ball rather than a piece you push in the stick should be much shorter. The stick is just as long as it is on any other earrings so these earrings constantly twist around my cartilage piercing. I‚Äôm likely going to stop using the ball and find a clear back piece I can use instead so that I‚Äôm able to push and tighten it on my ear.
3.0,Materials irritates my nieces ears which was bought as a gift.
3.0,"Cute dress, but the bust area is awkwardly shaped, so it makes my chest look wonky. Still worth the price & will look great under a cardigan, but I can't make it work with a strapless bra."
3.0,"I don't like to give anything less than 4 stars. But, here I am with three stars. They look flimsy, but not a bad product. One came scratched, the blueish one - the one for which I ordered the pack. Moreover, there was no option for replacement, that is pretty frustrating. Anyways, I guess, I should stop complaining as they were cheap.<br />To the seller: please make sure you pack the good products only. I do not want others to get scratched ones like mine."
3.0,Looks better in picture.
3.0,"The snowflake pendent is very pretty, but I thought it came with a chain, it did not...I had to purchase a separate chain, so I felt misled by the ad."
3.0,I like this shirt because it has a collar and no buttons. The cons are the white side panels will start to turn gray after a while and not wash white.
3.0,"I‚Äôve been using this bag a couple months now. I love the leather look of the outside and it fits my laptop, Wacom tablet and cords great. Was exactly what I needed because it fit into my backpack duffle bag for travel. However, the inside lining of the bag is made up of a fiber that sheds something awful. If you don‚Äôt mind that sort of thing, you will be satisfied. It has shed on all my gear."
3.0,It‚Äôs was cute but the material was not that soft!
3.0,It's too short for a dress. I'm 5'5 and it fits everywhere perfectly but is made too short.
3.0,Runs small and not as long as pictured.  Not what I expected.
3.0,Love them but I only received 11 of 12 of them.
3.0,"this dress is ok only things I would like to see it come in a bigger size instead of just 1x how about 2x or 3x, it fit nice on the top the only problem I has with it was it did not close at the bottom to good for a wipe dress to be. that why the next sixe would be better for people that have hip."
3.0,It's cheapy but if you're driving then other drivers won't be able to tell the quality of it. If anyone sees it on you in person though beware you will look ridiculously cheap
3.0,"Shoulders and sleeves great, body is very fitted, not like the picture"
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt look as nice as expected but good for the price
3.0,No strings to adjust a little weird on the butt part . It's kind of bunched up
3.0,Pants wripped right down the middle.
3.0,Cute and fit well but very low cut...shows bra easily
3.0,"These are pretty cool looking glasses. Fairly LARGE lenses that cover your eyes in rose-ish hue. However, when wearing contacts, these glasses seem to alter the vision slightly where anything one is looking at is slightly off in a refractive kind of way; just enough to be noticeable and annoying. Would these work with those who don't need corrective lenses? Probably."
3.0,"The glitter band separated from the rubber band only after a few wears. I recommend getting it if you only wear it on special occasions. Very pretty, not so durable."
3.0,"OK, but the thumb covers don't stay on. the mitten cover works well and gives easy access for the fingers, but the velcro and position of the thumb cover is not very functional.  OK for mild (around freezing) winters, will not work for extreme cold."
3.0,"It's more a mutated color of Plum and Brown mixed together, not Plum as pictured. One side of the interior lining was not stitched down, I can pull out half of the lining. I can deal with the lining but the color was misrepresented. Sure it was only $12.00, but still..."
3.0,"They're shorter than ankle socks, more like low-cuts, which is OK but not what I prefer. After one wash the nubs on the bottoms are already starting to crack. But I only wanted these for around-the-house wear, not for actual yoga, so they work well for me."
3.0,I ordered up one size and it fit perfectly.  The material is a bit sheer so you‚Äôd have to wear a slip underneath unless you don‚Äôt mind.
3.0,Its good. About the same as the last one i had only a little thicker.
3.0,Very thin material.  Pretty short as well.  The coloring of the tie dye was nice though.
3.0,"This shirt was made out of nice thick fabric, but it was not at all flattering on me. No matter which way I adjusted it I still looked like I was wearing teal burlap sack.<br /><br />I'm 5'2"" and have a chubby hourglass figure. I have a big bust, narrow shoulders, a bit of a tum and ""bingo wings"" that I'm trying to hide. So if you're built like me this might not be the most flattering look for you either."
3.0,"It is very useful while at home, but doesn't just look like a beanie because you can see the speakers bulge out a little on the sides. Very useful at home but somewhat awkward in public."
3.0,"The watch was as shown, but there were a couple of things that weren't obvious. As a disclaimer, this is a REALLY inexpensive watch. When you pay a cheap price, you need to expect a cheap a watch. I didn't have any illusions about this, but I still had a couple of unpleasant surprises. 1. The &#34;glass&#34; over the face of the watch was actually a piece of cheap plastic. This surprised me because a glass watch-face is extremely inexpensive. I just wasn't expecting it. 2. The number face of the watch is a sticker. This was obvious on my watch because they did a poor job of placing/smoothing out the sticker and there was a crease/air bubble.<br />With all that said, I bought a cheap costume pocket watch, and that's what I got. If you want a nice watch, then you'll want to shop in the appropriate price range (generally $70+)."
3.0,"First things first, sorry for the lack of better photos. They were taken not for reviewing purposes in mind. Some are screenshots of a video my friend sent to a bridesmaid who lives long distance. I sadly don't have an option to upload the video via mobile app. Okay, now onto the review!<br /><br />Shipment: It got to me in the two day mark (Amazon Prime). Warning! The package will be a lot smaller and lighter than you would think. It came with a jeweled belt/sash and some sort of bag. (I won't be using the bag included as a garment bag. It's way too small.)<br /><br />Sizing: I am normally a size 6-8 in dresses depending on the store and cut of the dress. After reading someone's suggestion to order a size up, I did, and I am so glad that I did. I got a size 10 and it barely fit me. If it was any smaller, my butt wouldn't have slipped in the dress comfortably. Also, I am 5'7 in height without shoes. You will need to wear heels to make up for the extra length at the bottom. I suggesting maybe 2-3 inches if you're my height.<br /><br />Putting this on: If you have a more curvaceous bottom, step into the dress versus putting this over you. The bottom is made more slim (the mermaid style), and putting it over your head  would cause the dress to suffocate you. (Lesson learned first hand, lol!)<br /><br />How it looks: Let me say this first, there are two visible seams running down the front. If I was a more financially blessed individual, I would have immediately returned this. Due to the price, I can't say that I'm surprised. Items made in China tend to look different than what's modeled in the stock photo. It's a huge problem and that's very sad. On a positive note, this fits my body perfectly. Anything smaller, anything bigger, and I would have been doomed.<br /><br />Material: This is a very cheap material. It's super light and thin. You would need to be careful of what kind of spanx and dress slip you would wear underneath. The seams may show through.<br /><br />Suggestions to buyers: Buy this if you're on a budget. It doesn't look bad and it'll do for the one hour wedding ceremony. Buy those sticky bras to help you lift your &#34;girls&#34; if you're a B cup like myself. Moreover, your thighs will be together while you walk. Wear spanx that has shorts at the bottom to prevent chaffing.<br /><br />Message to the Seller: Please provide your own photos when selling something. Therefore it leaves little room for misleading the customer. The two visible seams in the front are not acceptable. Unfortunately (or fortunately), you caught someone like myself in a conundrum because of how well it fits and how inexpensive it is."
3.0,I ordered a 7 (my normal ring size) and it was a bit snug. It‚Äôs still a very cute and affordable ring :)
3.0,"Not TV-accurate, but it's close enough that other Supernatural fans will recognize it as the &#34;Samulet.&#34;"
3.0,"I like the earrings a lot, but sadly one of the sticks that goes through the earring came broken."
3.0,It‚Äôs cute when you have it on and I like the different way you can tie it. But after ONE wash the straps weren‚Äôt looking so great. I just thought for $26+ tax the straps would hold up a little longer/more than one wash.
3.0,Thin pjs just like I wanted but they have no waste elastic at all and are REALLY flimsy.  Run short as well.
3.0,For a handmade item the quality of the fabric wasn‚Äôt great. There was a stain which looked like food on the bodice
3.0,Love this cover up.... It's cute with a bathing suit or with a tank and skinnies. My one complaint is that it started to fray somewhat quickly and it seems to stay kinda wrinkly.
3.0,the mags fall out of the straps so only use when using a non-mag fed blaster
3.0,"Got this for my girlfriend. She didn't like it, and doesn't use it."
3.0,"These are nowhere near knee length as shown, on my 13 year old they barely reach mid-calf. They are cute though and she likes them."
3.0,"Too small for daily use. Okay for a night out. I could not fit my key fob, glasses, lipstick, and tampon in and have it zip. I hate large handbags and was looking for something that had easy access to my phone. I'll keep it for a quick trip or use it as a wallet inside a larger bag."
3.0,"These look much cheaper in person than online,  but I only paid 7 bucks for them so I'm not mad. The will work for winter slip on boots"
3.0,Like the short..snug around the waist
3.0,Dress could of fitted better than I expected but a beautiful comfortable dress
3.0,"The fit is a bit small, or rather, the proportion seems small. The dress fits me, no doubt, but the sleeves are a bit too short, the waist is a bit too high ..... basically it looks like I‚Äôm wearing a dress that I‚Äôve borrowed from a friend who‚Äôs shorter than I am. It fits, it‚Äôs just not flattering. I think perhaps it was not designed with a tall Western body in mind.<br /><br />Sewing at the waist (where stripes meet solid black) is messy - some of the stitching is visible and I think after a few times wearing it the stitching might start to pull out completely.<br /><br />Bought this for a holiday trip, and at the price I paid I‚Äôm not going to bother returning it. I‚Äôll wear it for evening meals on the beach etc, but I wouldn‚Äôt honestly recommend it if you‚Äôre tall."
3.0,These came the same color pairs over and over in the set. The quality was fine for the price. They are comfortable to wear. I prolly could give some to my friends since I have so many of the same color in pairs.
3.0,"Material is very &#34; see through &#34;  Had to wear a cami underneath it, which took away from the appearance shown in the picture.  Would not order again"
3.0,"Cute, but very wide"
3.0,The arms are too small bit other than that it is wonderful.
3.0,"It‚Äôs good for ballin on a budget but straight up if you‚Äôre looking to impress spend the extra money to get the $120 helmet. I was very impressed with the stiffness of the helmet, if you wear a black ski mask under it it will fit nicely to your head."
3.0,"Really cute on, but the fabric is really thin."
3.0,"I've worked with leather (making leather items and owning & maintaining $$$harness and riding leather goods) over my many years, and some how, this 'stuff' feels very plastic. nice look, but unconvinced belt is 100% leather (excluding buckle). Poke me for my opinion Amazon, you'll get it."
3.0,They‚Äôre where to lose
3.0,I bought 3 necklaces. The clasp on one does not work. I can not open it. The other 2 are good.
3.0,they are thin and run on the small side.
3.0,"These took a very loooong time to get here. Let me tell you they are definitely oversized. Even the ears of the glasses look unusually large.  If you have a small face, don't order these. You will be lost behind them.  I have an average sized face frame and they are strangely large for ME. However the quality of the glasses and the UV protection level appear to be good (haven't worn them in bright sun yet)."
3.0,nice shirt but sizing is hard to figure out. Was a bit snug on our kiddo
3.0,Wish bottom covered a little more - but that could be my prob!
3.0,I bought these for my husband and they are more pink than red.
3.0,"The ""pink"" is much more a salmon color and so did not match my pink out fits.  It is a cute style however."
3.0,It‚Äôs very pretty and light weight.  I had hoped to use it for my pickleball gear but it is too small.  I will use it for something else.
3.0,"Love the puffy bell sleeves, very elegant. But I think it could have come down to hips. Shedded all over my black slacks. It looks like it may pill."
3.0,There cheap but cheap
3.0,"(I‚Äôm a woman 5‚Äô8, 200lbs) comfortable fitting bag!<br /><br />So far only time will tell. I bought this to upgrade from my 45L Bug out Bag.I don‚Äôt see double stitching and I‚Äôm not sure of the polyester number (600, 900 etc.)<br /><br />I did have a split zipper on the front middle pocket. It resolved with unzipping and rezipping. Also the bottom pocket where most people would put a pair of shoes has a difficult zipper! As a matter of fact I took the stuff out of that pocket and put it in the top compartment instead. It‚Äôs a lot of hassle for quick access. And there was a loose thread In The compartment as well. Two to be exact.<br /><br />I have this bag packed now! As I said before it‚Äôs a Bug out Bag so it‚Äôs going to sit in the corner for the most part until I use it. I just hope it holds up.<br /><br />The straps on this thing are incredibly padded! I love it! And the thick back air breathable pads and I love the pockets on the waist support!!"
3.0,"Not even close on the sizing, even with the automatic size up for Spanx.  Luxurious sausage casings, indeed."
3.0,Colors are not the best
3.0,"Loved the style of dress and it looked really good on me, but had to return it because the top of the dress has this weird seam by the sides of the underarms by the breast that is unflattering and unattractive."
3.0,Updated review: I took off another star because I have washed the dress twice and the smell is still so strong.<br /><br />I deducted 1 star because the smell of the dress is quite strong. I wonder if it was previously worn as it smells like a strong perfume and body odor. I can easily wash it but shouldn't have to for a supposedly new item. Other than the odor I am quite happy with the dress. It will look better with a petticoat because the fabric is thin.<br />I ordered size Large as it was suggested to go up a size. It fits with a bit of ease which is nice because it is for a Halloween costume so it will be more comfortable to wear. I am 5ft 1 inch and normally wear a size M shirt and size 6-8 pants. Ordered size Large. Hopefully that will help others ordering.
3.0,The hubby did not like the lack of support due to the loose fit in the hips.
3.0,Partly my fault but these are made of card board and the strings are to small for 6 year old heads. Probably better used decorating. The strings were small and painful for the kids.
3.0,"It‚Äôs pretty, good quality. But it doesn‚Äôt drape at the bottom like this one, grabs the hips. Makes me look bunchy, but it‚Äôs pretty to wear anyway"
3.0,The actual watch is big and seems to be of good quality. The band itself is total garbage. I‚Äôve worn this watch MAYBE 5 times and the band just simply tore apart. I have a ‚Äúgraveyard‚Äù of Invicta watches with torn bands. I don‚Äôt recommend rubber strap watches from Invicta.
3.0,They were a little tight on the sides of my feet.
3.0,"This backpack is well made, but nothing keeps it truly closed.  The latches on the side clasp it down, but if it's more than half full - the top opens up a bit."
3.0,Product was small but cute for my granddaughter
3.0,Great toy I just didn't read the description properly and thought it was bigger
3.0,Its a good watch (smaller then what i expected) but it took more then 30 days so just make note of that.
3.0,"These gloves are very comfortable and they will keep your hands warm in temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit.  I live in Northern Vermont.  I wore these gloves while plowing snow with 10-15 MPH wind at 15 degrees Fahrenheit.  They kept my fingers warm for about 15-20 minutes.  To think that they would work at 40 below zero is a fairy tale.  As for durability, too soon to tell.  I would purchase these gloves again at a $12-$15 price point, but at $30, never again."
3.0,"The evil eye palm piece  keeps falling off of the string. You could try to tighten it, but it still breaks relatively easily"
3.0,"Very comfortable and nice fit for me. Only one big problem. It stopped working for and hour or so the third day after it arrived. I tried to reset it by pulling the stem out, but that appears to be for looks only. So now it is useless.."
3.0,"It is very cute & good length just above knee (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù).  However, very cheaply made & runs small across the chest.  The top was tight and the zipper was very cheap so I didn‚Äôt even chance zipping it up.  It is thin see through material with the white but maybe would be ok in a darker color.  If this dress was on sale and you sized up it would still be a ok snag.  Just be aware this isn‚Äôt quality."
3.0,Don't go up enough on my legs
3.0,"Earrings do not hang correctly.  One hangs facing front, one faces back.  No way to correct without breaking the wires.  Also much smaller than I anticipated."
3.0,"It has aired out for over a month and still smells. The quality is good, but I wouldn't buy another."
3.0,"I have lost well over 60 lbs in under a year and switching out my wardrobe for things that flatter and fit. These were ordered in a size XL, from prior experience... I don't want to have to put the weight back on to fit into these... My neighbor thanks you...‚≠ê"
3.0,Large on waist. Its an ok dress but not worth the price
3.0,"The fit was great for my 7 year old who is an average size (I bought the 7-8 yo size).  Very cute and comfortable.  However, have your child try it on first and check the view of her private areas with her in different positions, as the fabric is very thin.  My daughter was (of course) wearing underwear as a 2nd layer of protection when I had her try it on,, but it still didn't leave much to the imagination down there.  I think she will have to wear shorts over this if we keep it, which kinda defeats the purpose of a leotard with built in shorts."
3.0,This is a picture of a stain glass window under glass. Not real stain glass.
3.0,i gave 5 stars for the brown belt I bought and love it so I ordered the black one and was disappointed with the quality. Wasn't near the belt the first one was .
3.0,Love the look. Wish it was shorter or came in a short version. The reason it is 3 stars is one of the buttons popped off on second use.
3.0,"The first day I wore these, I had an accident. Tripped and fell on a rough road. My knees and the tights were torn up. :( I did like the tights. They were true to what was advertised. But maybe I'll just go back to leggings that are thicker and more durable."
3.0,"This was not hemmed, but it's a fun print!"
3.0,Okay expected a better quality in the material
3.0,The pajamas were cute for our pictures and the top was super comfy but sleeves ran short and the bottoms had an inseam that was WAY too long as they all ripped after wearing only once.
3.0,"These are kind of cute... but they are a bit big, and they are uncomfortable to wear. They are a bit tacky looking unfortunately"
3.0,I liked them fine they were to small
3.0,Cute but these were too big for me. I‚Äôm 114 size 0 and I was swimming in these. Better if I was a size 2
3.0,I couldn't even tell that the design was owls.
3.0,Returned this as it was not what I was looking for. Although it was a very nice wallet. Just not my style. Return was easy!
3.0,"This fits like a shirt.  I am 5'9 and average to athletic build.  It gets 3 stars for color and fabric.  However, it is cut very small."
3.0,If you are curvy...don‚Äôt buy this dress. It‚Äôs going to be a great blouse though.
3.0,I really expected these to be thicker. They‚Äôre just a notch above being sheer. It‚Äôs so hard to find a good hair wrap
3.0,"A lot larger then I expected and wider, leaves a lot of space for glasses to move about"
3.0,Looked kinda cheap. Returned it.
3.0,I like the color and case overall but unless I attach a tether between top and bottom I Will loose the top.  There is to much ‚Äúplay‚Äù in the connection.  I have an older ‚Äúcigar‚Äù style case that included a tether (as seen in photo) for 20% less (unavailable now).
3.0,"Cheap, in consistently sized .Well you get what you pay. Cheap is Cheap Donated this one."
3.0,"Workmanship and fabric was great. But the size is way off. Very short waisted.  I am 5 ft 6 in and 132 lbs normally wear a small, 6-8 in a dress, I had to wear the large."
3.0,"El talle es peque√±o, mi pie mide 23 cms y apenas me calza el zapato."
3.0,"I really liked this dress. The material is light and comfortable for summer. I bought the green polkadot dress and the color is exactly as pictured here. I am really happy I bought this dress!<br />For reference I am 5'10"" and ~155lbs.<br />Update: I LOVED this dress but the seam ripped after a few wears making it unwearable:( Otherwise it was great."
3.0,I didn't read closely enough and was surprised by the lifts.  They're okay but when I wear them I worry that people can tell I'm wearing lifts.<br />The shoe itself is beautiful.
3.0,They are the ones I looking for .But I wish they can hold more money  !!! I still keep them !
3.0,This product definitely ran on the larger side. The material was extremely thick and I felt it made it awkward to walk or do yoga in. It was also very long in the legs. I was disappointed because I really wanted to love it.
3.0,"I usually wear a size 8. I ordered a 8 1/2 to be safe, and it still runs a little small I can barely fit them and I have narrow feet.  Wish I would have ordered a 9.  The color is good.  They are a true White like I wanted, and not a cream color."
3.0,Bigger than I expected but good quality
3.0,"It runs really big, but I didn't have time to order another dress."
3.0,"They fit well and looked pretty similar to the official picture, but I find the elastic on the top and bottom pretty uncomfortable."
3.0,Bonito pero ser√≠a mejor en una tela de algod√≥n m√°s fresca. Est√° acorde con el precio.
3.0,"I was gifted this watch on August 16th, 2017. It's a gorgeous watch, simple, clean, elegant. BUT the battery has ALREADY died and it no longer works. A little ridiculous, no?"
3.0,"Ok, but doesn't actually look like the show"
3.0,"I wanted to wait a couple of weeks to write this review as a runner, I wanted to give an accurate review on my experience with this item. As a broke college student this is as close to the nike free runs I am going to get.<br />Pros:<br />The color is beautiful, the picture does it no justice. They look a lot better in person. Also, they look great and dainty on my feet even though I wear a size 8.<br />They are super light weight. Generally, I run in my five finger shoes so I am all about comfortability and these babies were that.<br />They are affordable. As a college student, this is a big concern of mine.<br />Cons:<br />You can tell that the foam part at the bottom of the shoe will not last. The stitching is weak.<br />I ran twice in these and the bottom is already showing wear and tear. I decided to stop running in them and just wear them to yoga or out for running errands.<br />They are affordable. Therefore, the material used are not the best and it probably won't last forever but for now it will do.<br /><br />Overall: I wouldn't say they are terrible shoes just not running shoes. If you are an avid runner, you'll probably get 10 runs out of them. However, they are very cute and affordable and can easily become your go to shoes when you're rushing to a workout class or rushing to run some errands."
3.0,Very cute and soft material but it shrunk about two sizes when I accidentally put it in the dryer. Still cute though
3.0,This product is okay. Fits as expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù 200lbs. I‚Äôm a boxer and like my tanks a little loose.  The material is fine but nothing special.  The cut at the bottom of the tank is weird.  Not a straight cut almost like a dress shirt. I‚Äôll keep them but they are nothing to write home about.
3.0,These stud earrings are pretty but a little to large.  I was hoping for a smaller and dainty.  They do sparkle.
3.0,I ordered black to match all the cousins and it‚Äôs navy blue. Definitely not black.
3.0,Item runs MUCH smaller than indicated.
3.0,"They describe the robe as being ""thick"". Actually, it's not thick, but rather thin. More important - I ordered a size Medium as I'm 5'3 and 125 pounds. The ""medium"" robe was extremely small and does NOT go to the floor, or even close to the floor. The sleeves are also about 6 inches too short. The robe is NOT roomy because it's too small. Their idea of ""medium"" is what we would call a size small... Other than not fitting, the robe is as expected - soft and practical."
3.0,It‚Äôs cool. I paid $6 for the shirt with the understanding that it would take a thousand years to receive. It is polyester. That was a shocker. So let‚Äôs how this breathes. It was worth a shot.
3.0,"I am 5'5, 220, 38DDD<br />Dress does not fit as pictured, I will try to upload...it is shorter, and the little elt will not look like that.  But, I still like the dress.  I pulled it out and was thinking i dont like the material, but, it is not bad.  I think with some spanks, this dress will garner lots of compliments.  I maybe could have gone up a size because I dont really like for my clothes to hug my body."
3.0,Nice quality. Got the scarfs for my hair. They are very small. I didn‚Äôt think I had a big head but apparently I do. I‚Äôm unable to use the the way I intended.
3.0,Definitely could have ordered a size smaller. I‚Äôm chesty and about 5‚Äô3 190lbs. Wine red looks more burnt orange to me. Very sheer. Comfortable but definitely won‚Äôt wear for what I needed it for. Still cute if you can pull off slinky stuff but I prefer my dresses to be snug up top. Came super fast as well.
3.0,"Product look great , just too small at the waist recommend putting better sizes on website"
3.0,Needs Longer shorts area
3.0,Pattern was last than desirable with how its printed on the surface of the fabric. Any stretch and it's nearly sheer or white.
3.0,"It's ugly, but it will get the job done."
3.0,The only thing I didn't like was the material. Polyester itch
3.0,VeryCute but the ear fell off in 1st wash...
3.0,Cute for the price but earrings broke
3.0,"These jeans were nice but I found them to be way to long. Nice stretchy fabric, perfect hit just below the navel and great fit in the butt and hips. If you are a bit taller than 5‚Äô1 you‚Äôll love these jeans!"
3.0,Much larger than I expected.  They are also hard to get through your earing holes. They are fairly heavy.  Overall they are okay though.
3.0,I wasn't as happy as I thought I would be.  Used these for a youth conference so didn't have a lot of money to spend.  Price was right but they didn't glow like I thought they would when we were in the dark center.
3.0,ok- quick delivery- not what I expected- very small
3.0,This pin was much smaller in size than I thought the picture showed  - could be my fault - I should have looked more closely at the measurements
3.0,pRETTY BUT LOOK A LITTLE CHEAP;.
3.0,I ORDERED BY CORRECT SIZE  AND THE SIZE ON THIS DRESS RUNS REALLY SMALL
3.0,Fit well<br />Not as tight on midsection as id of liked it to have been. But overall ok
3.0,"These looked very cute and costs more than others, but were cute enough to be worth it, but I never received them and don't have a real way to rate them, but I'm being asked to rate them so this is the best I can do."
3.0,They are very soft and comfortable as advertised  although after only 3 weeks the seams started coming apart in the wash and they started doing a weird balling up bunching of the fabric all over them. The blue pair had a huge hole in the crotch when it arrived so never got to wear that pair.
3.0,"It's not wat I expected, was looking for a real Coreset but turned out alright at the end. The bad part about it is putting it on..u will need help!, or do wat I do; turn the hooks to the front and then spin the shirt around once fasten."
3.0,"I love the Lularoe TC leggings fit. These don't quite fit the same.<br />The print is good as you do not lose the picture if they get stretched out, but the fit is just not quite there.<br />Not high waisted like Lularoe.<br />I'm 5'10, 210lbs."
3.0,"The idea is a good one. Maybe instead of using velcro a button with different slots would work better. Also, the velcro trim is very hard so that is the scratching culprit. I tried folding it so my LO wouldn't be scratched but because it's so short she still got it off."
3.0,It wasn't very flattering to me. Felt like a big sheet.
3.0,"Really simple and elegant. The face of the watch looks really nice. The only real negative is the strap, it feels cheap and is difficult to claspe.<br /><br />The watch also arrives with an extra battery, wrist pin removers, and some other small items.<br /><br />Great gift."
3.0,It's a beautiful coat but the sizes are off
3.0,"I Love the size an weight, but the light was too dim to see anything at night"
3.0,Nice shirt but the print quality is poor. Definitely not as shown on line. The tree is pink!
3.0,"I bought them because they were reasonable. But the quality was not good, so I returned it."
3.0,"Not what I expected, but too late for return"
3.0,Very soft and comfortable to wear. But can't verify stretchiness because I have super small wrists. Even tightening it as much as I can it's still loose enough that the watch won't read my steps. Would be better for people with bigger wrists.
3.0,They are cheap in price and the product quality matches.  The threads are all bend and tangled when the product arrives and they dont hang right when worn.
3.0,Very soft and would be comfortable but fits rather snug.
3.0,"Looks nice, very light. Was trying to readjust it on my wrist and with that 1 good flick a pin came right out.  I was able to pop it back in and haven't had any issues with it yet, but I'm a little worried to wear it. Pulls on arm hairs too. Other than that it's a good looking piece."
3.0,I love the color and the design but the material seems too cheap
3.0,Very nice but tooo expensive for wire!!!
3.0,"This dress is very comfy, love the pockets. The color/pattern is nice and can be worn at many casual events. My only complaint is the fit. It seems to run a bit large. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, weigh 126 pounds, and am busty.  I ordered a medium because I am in my 60‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt like clothes that are tight in the chest or super short. This dress fits very loose and is just barely above my knee (frumpy fit). Again, very cute but be careful when selecting your size."
3.0,Doesn't stay  'unrolled' well.  Looked messy as it wanted to roll.  Great idea if it were a bit smaller.  I have an average size head.
3.0,Exactly as described. Took awhile to receive.
3.0,Was smaller than expected and had a small tear in the mesh top. Will be returning.
3.0,"If you're pair-shaped, this might fit weird no matter what you do. I'm 5'3"" 123lbs, went with a large so it would be roomy when I sleep. The top is too big, but that's my fault. However the bottoms are STILL too tight with the elastic, so I really never wear them. Should have returned, but it's cute, so I wanted to find a way to make them fit. If you can sew, go for it. Needs adjustments in my experience."
3.0,The bracelet fell apart right after I got it I wanted this so bad too
3.0,I feel these should be marked as compression gloves; they are very tight.
3.0,"There was only 1 insert in the pack. Everybody I asked, responded that there were 2, 3, or more inserts in the regular pack. The description of this item says 5 windows, as everyone else has stated, each insert has only 4 windows. This is an okay insert, but it is terribly overpriced. . . ."
3.0,It is a very cool watch. The only problem I found is that when you're outside at day it is very hard to see the time.
3.0,"Haven't tried it on yet. Don't know how it will fit, however I like the design."
3.0,"The socks were soft and thick, but each pair of sock is a different size- see picture for reference‚Ä¶. good thing I have different aged children in my home, or else I would have returned this order!"
3.0,One touch of a finger and you will have to clean. For the money its expected will use as backup glasses.
3.0,Very soft and comfortable but got holes within three months. So disappointing.
3.0,Much darker than expected.
3.0,"The fabric is VERY thin, and the stitching isn‚Äôt straight."
3.0,Nice bit looks better in the picture
3.0,"I wanted to use this collar for taking my English Bull Terrier on walks/to the park/etc. for that extra 'bling' factor. I was slightly disappointed when I received this as it is on the cheap side. The collar is extremely lightweight but not sturdy. With the description stating it was stainless steel, I was hoping it was like other choke chains that I have, just gold. It is definitely not. It does look great and works very well for pictures. However, I would not trust this for leash purposes, especially if you have a large dog that pulls."
3.0,Nice looking leggings for a good price.  Unfortunately these kept sliding off my backside which was very annoying.  The fitting was 'off'.
3.0,"Cute pattern, but not the right style for me.  The shirt is a shimmery style fabric, and although I typically wear a size medium in clothes (5'6&#34;, 145lbs, average frame), this was a bit large.  The armpit holes were a little big as well.  Shipped fast though!"
3.0,"It supports perfectly w no jiggle, but the cups are thin, and the seams in back are itchy and it run Tight around the ribs for sure."
3.0,Decent watch band but didn't include the prongs that connect the band to the watch.  I've ordered other bands and those included the prongs.
3.0,"I ordered a 2X and they ended up sending me a 3X. (I verified my order before writing this to see if I messed up, it says 2X). It was still slightly too small. It took me 3 minutes just to zip it up. Once it was on it was fine but I don‚Äôt want to spend 3 minutes trying to zip it up every day."
3.0,"Very tiny bag!  It only holds the laptop and a notebook, no more room."
3.0,"The Grid-It organizer is exactly what I ordered and is a great product. I ordered this one, because I bought a smaller one for myself. I ordered this larger one as a gift- but on the back is some advertising from a Las Vegas Dental convention in 2011= OBIVIOUSLY a giveaway at the convention.  AS I ordered this as a birthday gift I am little peeved.  I have to give it due to time restraints - but I might have to order another one if the person I ordered it for doesn't like Dentistry!! ARGHHHHHHHHHHH"
3.0,This is a low quality sweatshirt. It definitely does not look as good as it does in the picture. It‚Äôs cute enough to hang around the house in but that‚Äôs about it.
3.0,Absolutely loved it but the sizing is way too small. please order atleast 1 size up or 2 size up if you prefer a little loose fit.
3.0,"Cute and was excited when I got them, they fit perfect. I ran them through the wash and now they are too small, they shrank by quite a bit in the wash."
3.0,Pretty bag but don‚Äôt expect them to arrive folded in the little pocket. Takes 10 minutes just to figure out how to fold properly without just stuffing them in!!
3.0,Color wasn‚Äôt exactly as it looks in image. Kore of a yellow green.
3.0,Belt stretches eventually
3.0,"It‚Äôs a nice modest dress but not my style. The material is definitely not for casual wear. Also, I got it in an extra small but it was too big, felt like I was wearing a small or medium."
3.0,"They were good except they broke very easily other than that they were great,"
3.0,It looks cheaper than I thought it would.  The neckless is molded to the shape of the box it came it so it looks a bit awkward on.
3.0,Cute design and soft material but the toe seam is right across the front and the style is basically a short tube sock. Not having a heel is irritating (to me) when wearing boots. I won‚Äôt be wearing them as often as I had hoped.
3.0,I did not like the fabric as well as I thought I would.  It did not have much body and at the bottom seemed to hold wrinkles.
3.0,These are not tube socks. They have standard toe/heel. I‚Äôm somewhat disappointed as I have small feet and they‚Äôre a bit too big in the foot.
3.0,"I really liked the size of this, not too flashy. Needed a ring to sub in for my wedding ring when I was pregnant and this did the job. Gave three stars because I dropped on tile once and tiny diamond came out."
3.0,The glass has broken after one year usage.
3.0,These run large but are super cute. My toddler who is 3 is able to wear the headbands not my 6 week old.
3.0,Made for small men.
3.0,The beige is a dark tan. Wish I would have ordered cream. The picture does not match the color.
3.0,Well I guess a cheap purse is a cheap purse. The design is cool and the design is good. But it‚Äôs NOISY. The inside is some sort of crunchy material that sounds like I‚Äôm wadding up cellophane. It‚Äôd kinda be embarrassing at the grocery store. Maybe if I wad it up a little it won‚Äôt be so crunchy.
3.0,Looks much better in person. Stitching quality is not great. The inside slip is shorter but for the price its fine.
3.0,"It's very dark, the silver and the stone is almost orange. Looks fake.  The darkness comes from the silver, hardly any silver showing through. An over-worked process."
3.0,Screen printing wasn't as nice as I had hoped but still happy over all.  My husband loved the shirt.
3.0,It didn't cut the glare as much as I had hoped.
3.0,"Okay quality, but it's 100% see through. As another reviewer said, only some of the products come with lining. I'm 5'5 size 6 and the XL fit fine. It might be nice as a beach cover up. It's probably a great fit for women with shorter torsos."
3.0,came flat but opened up after they sat out of the bag for a week
3.0,Looks nice but that‚Äôs all. Doesn‚Äôt stay on well and water gathers in the bottom of it.
3.0,thin in both width and bulk. Expected more but they're not too bad.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt like the waistline.
3.0,"Good selection, very thin"
3.0,Fit well<br />Warm enough<br />Wore without washing.<br />Broke out in huge red itchy patches. BEWARE
3.0,I was so excited to get this coat.  Winter white color was perfect and it's well made.  I'm returning it for a an XL. I wear a 10/12 and ordered a M. It is so tight in the arms and shoulders I couldn't even get it on all the way.  If the XL fits it'll be 5 stars.
3.0,"Beautiful, but somewhat fragile."
3.0,"Nice smooth material. It's not Spanx-level slimming but you can definitely feel your butt and tummy being hugged. Ordered a S based on other reviews. Length was great (I'm 5'1) and still felt like it had stretch to fit someone a few inches taller. The only drawback was the panty line effect. I liked the slimming feeling on my butt, however it did dig in enough to wear the likes were noticeable under my dress. If I ordered M it would have been too big everywhere else."
3.0,"you get what you pay for, its cheap, it looks ok for costume jewelry, up close obviously very fake, its pretty thick and not flexible..."
3.0,Definitely for adults. It was still pretty big on me
3.0,"Chain broke very easily, paint on the actual key chipped quickly but I don‚Äôt mind"
3.0,Too huge! I was not expecting them to be this large
3.0,The snaps are way harder to unhook then they look! It takes so long that I end up not using it!
3.0,"The material is great, but the seam fitting seems off based on my height/weight 6'0/175lbs.  I would be comfortable going down in these pants, however the fit is not as comfortable as I had hoped for (noticeably the crotch area). Seems that the seam is too short or something."
3.0,"This product is easy to use. After using the long shoe horn for a few weeks it bent. It still functions, but it‚Äôs no longer comfortable to use."
3.0,"These get the job done for the price, but the lenses are extremely prone to scratches. Yeah yeah, I know, I could just keep track of them better, but that's what cheap sunglasses are for! I have to argue that my 4 dollar pair from the local fleamarket have been through substantially worse things than this pair, but look relatively new in comparison. If you dig the style then go for it, otherwise consider my review."
3.0,I have ordered several raglan shirts in this size. This is the first one that is not true to size.<br />  Gave it away after trying it one. I wanted something loose to wear with jeans or leggings.  Didn't work for either as it is made smaller through the chest and arm area.
3.0,Very cute but the lace part is delicate and rips easily.
3.0,They fit a little snug but I love the color of them !
3.0,"Decent quality. Good ( not great)buy. Purchased these for a 7yo girl, as a ‚Äúneutral‚Äù color shoe. I‚Äôm only not returning them is because She LOVES THESE SHOES!! They are not what was pictured. Great for a girls first heals. Suede bottom and lots of cushion and support. However, They are bright orange. Not same color as pictured. They fit great. Wearer has quite a narrow foot and she required looser holes. The strap isn‚Äôt long enough to create additional holes. I would not recommend these if you are shopping for a girl w a normal-wide/wide foot.  Shoes arrived damp w dye on the tissue paper and foam shape holder. Even after being air dried the Dye comes off on tights and or socks. Bottom of shoe has a suede type material that feels soft- but will stain. I‚Äôm not expecting them to last 20 wears before they look gross, hence why they aren‚Äôt a great buy"
3.0,"I love the way this dress looks on me.  Very cute, very breezy in the heat, and I got a lot of compliments HOWEVER, on the fourth or fifth wear, the dress ripped at the butt due to the cheapness of the fabric.  I'm fairly certain I can sew it back up, but it was a very stressful thing to happen at a corporate party.  5'3&#34;, 140 lbs and small bust.  Medium fit well."
3.0,Fun but seem to stretch out easily
3.0,For the price is okay but mine came with a lot of scratches and stain.
3.0,I ordered this in a XXL because I usually wear a XL but because of my chest I need much bigger in Asian sizes. The bottoms sort of fit but the top didn't fit around my breasts at all. It's cute but I don't like the feel of the fabric and didn't fit as I expected it to. It also came with this weird ponytail thing.
3.0,"No instructions! Once I read reviews it confirmed my assumption that a plastic layer was on the suface. Remove the thin layer of plastic before sublimating. I didn't like the facet that the are so small and the plastic part to attach the metal ring is cheaply made. If you're planning to charge someone for this, look for a more sturdy quality."
3.0,Lanyard is nice just wish it was stronger broke the first day I had it right on the clip
3.0,this top is made really well. I will say that the material is thick and it would be hot to wear in the heat of the smmer. I Think that this top would be great to wear under a cardigan in the fall.<br /><br />In my opinion however the top runs a little big so It did not fit me like I was wanting it to.
3.0,"Great sunglasses! Long time love for the brand, just this style wasn't for me. The lenses are to small for my taste. I had to return."
3.0,I'm a size 10-12 and a L fits like a tight M. And the pants are very see through. Ice silk like  the mask I have is what I thought I was getting. Cool I the touch and all. It's not really but its gridded and being so see through on top of gridded will keep you cool to a point.
3.0,"It's NOT 3/4 sleeve (it's long sleeve), it's NOT off the shoulder (it's V-neck, cross-bodice) and there are NO POCKETS.<br />Still, it's a nice dress, runs a wee bit small, but it's flattering."
3.0,"At first I was very please with these boxers. After wearing them I started to feel uncomfortable. I think the problem is there is no ""Crotch Pocket"" no buldge room, so things shift, making it uncomfortable."
3.0,"Nice looking fabric and construction, but cup size is small in correlation to bottoms size.  The XXXL cups cover D cup at best.  Not a great suit for large bust."
3.0,I sized up and it was still too small.
3.0,OK for a smaller  person
3.0,"Cute and my daughter loved it.  But it lasted a whole 2 months.  As other reviews stated, it runs SMALL. I sized up, but then accidentally dried it and it shrank about half a size.  The skirt tears/runs easily as well."
3.0,"Beautiful crown, but as an adult with a very normal sized head, I can say that this is for children. It did not fit my head."
3.0,Size up. The arm ‚Äúsleeves‚Äù have zero stretch and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going back. Impossible to move my arms and it left marks after trying it on for a few minutes. I don‚Äôt have fat arms at all btw. It‚Äôs a cute dress but def size up to accommodate chest and arms.
3.0,"It fits and compresses well, used them during a trip, mostly during the flight.<br /><br />CON: Sims in the inside dig in to your skin."
3.0,"Got this for my 10 year old son for Christmas. It looks really nice. However the packaging wasn‚Äôt great I was really hoping that it would have come in a box or tin. Just something nice looking and easy to wrap and put under the tree. We‚Äôll see how it holds up after Christmas. Over all it looks nice, I love that it has the time in digital as well as the hands! The colors are great and my son Will be over the moon that the watch is black and redüòç"
3.0,"I have a few pair of Starfish pants purchased via Amazon from LE, but these are not the same as the others. The material looks faded or burnt shiny as if pressed to long on an iron, and they are discolored as if bleach was splattered on them all over the outside in different places.<br />I called LE to see if they were legit and the serial number matched the authentic<br />LE manufacturer. PROBLEM IS...no one wants to exchange these defective for good pants for FREE. Not my fault I received a defective product. Sad indeed. Stuck with them and they remain in the packaging..."
3.0,"The green is not the same shade as in the picture. It's more neon, so it doesn't match well with the bronze. There also isn't a heart charm one end of the necklace. Other than these details, the necklace looks nice overall."
3.0,"3 stars because I‚Äôm missing 16 sticks. These are party favors for my sons party, now I‚Äôm going to have 16 kids with no sticks to scratch off their masks.<br />Other than that the masks are all as described"
3.0,These are great to wear with a sweater dress or if not with a dress a long shirt as they are see through. Very warm and soft on the inside. I like them especially since they come in different colors.
3.0,4th or 5th time I have bought this pants.  They ran little small this time.  But still quality.
3.0,"Had to put a few pieces back on when I got it because it had come apart. It's pretty cheaply made, but looks cute"
3.0,It's comfortable but a bit long in my opinion.
3.0,"Amazing quality for the price. I ordered a L, I'm 5'9"", athletic build. It squished my chest and wasn't long enough for my torso making it a little too cheeky and uncomfortable. Sad to return and hope to find the same print in a different style."
3.0,Broke after almost 2 months
3.0,Was expecting the side to be a little bit larger than what it is.
3.0,"Very comfortable, and actually very thick, I thought they were going to be like tights but they are actually socks. My only downfall is the sticky tape inside doesn‚Äôt work that well, they kept falling all day."
3.0,Love the shirt in the print it just if it‚Äôs way too small if you‚Äôre a big chested I would suggest go on a bigger size up
3.0,It tapers too much from the bottom of the bag to the zipper making it difficult for me to use. Otherwise it would have been perfect. The only other thing is that it is not returnable.
3.0,maybe good for larger cam film video or carry luggage
3.0,"A little too big for me. I received a large, dont remember ordering a large. And I wasnt quite sure what to do with the ties on the side. The quality was decent for the price. I just needed a smaller size. And the color in the pictures is definitely misleading because the product looks nothing like that. I would have preferred the lime color, but oh well..."
3.0,Strating to rust already
3.0,"Unfortunately,  the backpack I received was defective. One of the front straps was missing. Of course, I returned it without a problem."
3.0,"Very nice jars, but one of the sprayers broke within a week."
3.0,It does say in the description that it is a sapphire crystal but it is NOT it is mineral crystal. I had to send mine back because the crown was very hard to screw back down and the winding was not smooth at all. Hopefully the replacement they send me will be better. But they do need to change the description if they are not going give you sapphire crystal. Its sapphire coated instead which is Not the same at all.
3.0,I was torn between ordering a small or a medium... I ordered a medium just to be safe and it was way too tight on me! Order 1-2 sizes up for sure.
3.0,Love the way it feels and fits at the top but this should never be worn as a dress lol.
3.0,Liner ripped after a couple months and the shoulder strap never stays where you adjust it to stay. But besides those fairly big issues I really like the bag.
3.0,there is no way they used the same tshirt style as pictured. This tshirt is the square boxy kind that is always too short and wide under the pits. Not a long skinny women's cut as pictured here.
3.0,They‚Äôre super cute but it lasted maybe a month after I put them on my sons shoes‚Ä¶.
3.0,"It‚Äôs just ok.....  I bought the mustard color and it‚Äôs VERY yellow and bright, not at all like the picture.  I will be returning it."
3.0,"I just recieved these and although they are a great feel and quality they do tend to run small. I am 5'9&quot; 185lbs, muscular, and they felt tight around the chest arear. I would recommend going up atLEAST  1-2 sizes."
3.0,"This is tight af in my arms. I bought it to wear for a powerlifting meet mostly, with intentions for future gym sessions. Would be better sleeveless. I'm about 5'7"" have been lifting for years and am not huge but broad shoulders/lats/shoulders. Not my face but I can get away with if I stretch out the sleeves a bit."
3.0,Just too large around the stomach area
3.0,difficult to screw on
3.0,"the stones from the bottom were no longer glued in, and they aren‚Äôt clip on earrings"
3.0,one eye is off yet ok. was going to return gave to my friend who loves it.
3.0,The material feel was nice but it was waaaaaay smaller than normal sizing. I returned it. 3 stars for feel and look even though it doesn‚Äôt fit me like it should.
3.0,The fit is narrow yet big
3.0,Cute slipper but I wish it had a flat sole. It has a slight platform which made it a little difficult to walk in. My granddaughters foot seemed to roll off the platform and I was afraid that she was going to hurt her ankle.
3.0,"I got these for my mother in law who is a diabetic. She wears a lot of house shoes due to the pain in her feet. She wears a size 8. However, when they came in they were so small I kept them for myself as I wear a size 6. They fit me perfectly. They‚Äôre super soft and we‚Äôre tight to my feet for the most part for the first week of wear. After that they began to lose quality. The bottoms are like a foam type of bottom instead of rubber so they wear out really easily. Also the furry part stretches out and I caught myself curling my toes up to keep them on when I walked. As for comfort they‚Äôre extremely soft and warm and comfortable to wear. But they run very small and lose quality quickly."
3.0,"These are fun bracelets, great for everyday use.  I ordered blue, but bracelets received were turquoise/teal.  Not what I wanted.  Too much trouble to return.  Still, I'm wearing them."
3.0,"Fit well,  but was thin and see through.  Worked for what I needed it for, but wont be able to wear it regularly.  I liked that it didnt add extra bulk so I guess that is the trade off. Wear nude shorts underneath and you'll be golden."
3.0,An X-large is too small. Order a size larger. Fast shipping.
3.0,"These are nice looking wood and brass bracelets. When opening the bag they came in, they had a very strong odor to them I didn't like much. But they do look elegant. Unfortunately, these are too big for me. They slide on my hands and wrist easily and in turn, slide off easily too. I have very small wrists and have trouble finding bracelets that fit me, so I'm not surprised. But these should fit standard sized  wrists. If they were more fitted I would happily wear them."
3.0,It's pretty but should just be used for decoration since mine started leaking almost immediately.
3.0,This sock monkey outfit is so cute was big for a new born weighing 7.12 oz I love this made very well be aware of size when ordering
3.0,Cheesy feeling but for the price it's a cute maxi dress
3.0,"Only 3 weeks after Christmas and they already have holes and tears.  My granddaughter has worn them every day per Mom, hard to say how hard she was on them, but since it is a children's slipper, I feel it should hold up better. She loves them so much I will try to glue and fix.  Bah"
3.0,"Don‚Äôt be confused by the word ‚Äúpack‚Äù in the description. It is a single pin, NOT a pack as depicted in description and main photo."
3.0,Good basic costume piece but mine arrived missing an earring ;(
3.0,No where near as purple as shown and I may be wrong but these are definitely not polarized
3.0,"This blouse is pretty.  It runs a little large.  Its shear at the bottom and dips down along the sides, which shows any sort of bra.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the khaki color is more of a peach color.  This was disappointing, as I needed a true khaki color for our pictures."
3.0,The leggings are worth $10 but not really more. Rough fabric and it the legs is printed on the leggings so will not likely stand up to many washings.
3.0,It is over priced
3.0,The earrings arrived earlier than expected and are beautiful. However I made the mistake of wearing them to the beach and once the salt water hit them the shine left and the rose gold plating started to wear. For the price they are worth it. I am ordering another pair and keeping these as a back ups (I have a habit of loosing studs) Just make sure you take them off around water!
3.0,Gift for a friend...
3.0,"This top is pretty nice. I love the green color and the quality isn‚Äôt too bad (not awesome, but not bad). I would definitely size up because it is very small across the chest/shoulders."
3.0,It's not bad. But not great.  I will still wear. The shipping was super fast!
3.0,I only ordered three bonnets.  I received two of the same and one different.  I can't believe there are only two designs.  Is it that difficult to send 3 different styles?  Very disappointed.
3.0,Super cute but really big
3.0,The flare is too much for my ears.
3.0,Irregular left-shoulder strap was longer than the right shoulder strap-  too late to exchange.
3.0,"Food stains/crust, ripped seem. Came without any tags.<br />I like how they fit, so I ordered replacement."
3.0,It looks like it's part of a dance costume.
3.0,"Things I loved:<br /><br />1. Lightweight<br />2. Stretch: thought I would not like this because I've only known jeans and leather belts<br />3. The narrower profile allows for easier looping and more subtle.  Doesn't look out of proportion if you aren't wearing ""outdoor"" style clothes.<br />4. Leave on pant and machine wash.<br /><br />Things I didn't:<br /><br />1. The buckle pinches my fingers when clasping.  Yes, it's been a few months to get my motor skills adapted to this new skill.  Yes, I still get pinched.<br />2. Not good for heavier weight pants like jeans.  To hold up heavier pants you have to make the waist tighter than comfortable to keep pants up.  But it is perfect for synthetic pants, lighter weights pants, adventure hiking pants, etc...<br />3. No taper to the male and female ends of the buckle -- this means you have to guide all four corners of the buckle with your fingers to close -- leading to the pinched skin....<br />4. Adjusting size is a taking it off, guessing and then checking it again for sizing affair.  Losing weight, different size pants, different weight pants all determine the optimal belt length and is slightly different enough to require adjusting (because of the elastic nature.) This means you can fine tune it and be super comfortable but it also means that doing this for each time you wear the belt on a different pant gets real old real fast.  I wind up just keeping it sized for the one pair of light pair of pants; then I keep this belt on that said pants and it just never comes off.  This makes it kind of wasteful / expensive for how I'm using it.<br /><br />On these particular pair of pants, this belt is a 5 star.<br />I would rate it 2.5 stars as just a belt, maybe less if it had to be my only belt"
3.0,Very delicate. I snagged it a bit when it got caught on the sticky part of the wrapping in came in. It is still a lovely addition to my themed collection.
3.0,"These are good sunglasses for $20. They fit a bit large on my face. The rubber on the ends of the temple, where it sets behind my ear, has started to peel back. When folded, the temple tip has begun to rub a line on the inside of the lenses."
3.0,"Good looking shoe..definitely get what you pay for..as others have written, the smell can be quite harsh when un-boxing the shoes. Smells very harsh of strong chemical dyes used on the shoe.<br /><br />(I left the shoe outside for 3 days and they still smell pretty strong üëéüèº)"
3.0,"Its a great design, the chrome is falling off after a couple months.  Didnt know it was copper."
3.0,"It's ok, thin material, does the job. In my opinion it does not run small. I got a medium and it's swimming on me. Will prob buy a small"
3.0,Fits small. I'm 5'4 130 and it felt tight and restricting and I got a medium for it to fit loose. But fabric is nice.
3.0,"Its difficult to see in the photos, but the back of this dress has no lining. So your child's bare skin will be showing through the eyelet holes. As I was purchasing this dress for my child to wear to church, this wouldn't be appropriate."
3.0,It's nice but I  keep getting  stack  in everything  that  has magnet  it's funny  and it kind of hard to  put it on  because  it keeps getting rolled  up  and the magnet part keeps getting  stuck  everywhere in  the magnet and ot looks like ots dirty  just by  warning it a few weeks  but I  kind like it
3.0,Fit not good. But Actualky I don‚Äôt like Grey.
3.0,"Getting them into my ears was a long, unbearable issue.<br />(6g)"
3.0,It is like a full pant and not like Caprie.im of height 5.2
3.0,love bracelet clasps hard to use!
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d829f8190ec0ae2be353f1d1ac619c94]] The style is in now. It makes the outfit. Piece in the pic came a part prior to train stop pic but reassembled it. Overall, happy with the product."
3.0,Gets loose on its own when I bend down or it feels pressure
3.0,Ran smaller then expected.
3.0,"Kinda thin cotton, not a sweater dickie.  Runs a bit small."
3.0,They're beautiful and I love how they look in my ears however they are not true to standard sizing and my ears have shrunk because of this.
3.0,"They are great shoes! But, unfortunately too small. I purchased a 12 and my son is exactly a 12. I should have gone a size up."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this romper. As a tall woman with a long torso it is hard for me to find rompers that are long enough in the legs, but still fit my upper body. This romper was definitely long enough, but the top half of it fit like a bag until it got up to my chest where it was pulling across. If the chest had been just a little bit looser and the waist/torso a little more fitted I definitely would have kept this. The sizing was just odd for me. I am 5'8 and ordered a small for reference."
3.0,Fit fine and I really like how the sleeves are tighter than my other jerseys.  But I've found that both of the Fox Jerseys I've owned snag really badly.  Both I've owned snag way worse than my TLD or Fly Racing jerseys.
3.0,Not stretchy enough
3.0,"I ordered a set of these a year ago and love the fit. This  order they are different, it is too bad. they do not fit as well, and I have not changed, because the older ones still fit great. I do love the silk!"
3.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet, but it will only fit a small wrist. I ordered it based on the representation that it would fit an 8 inch wrist and I couldn‚Äôt even get it on. Sadly, I had to return it and am still waiting for my refund. If you have a small (6-3/4 inch) wrist, you will love the design. Stars are for the design."
3.0,"Although the pendant is pretty, it does not look exactly like it does in the photo.  The legs don't have the same curvature as a wishbone IMO.  It looks more like an arch.  It also did not come with the chain featured in the photo.  It was a silver snake chain that was too much of a contrast with the pendant.  I got a gold chain to match the metal of the pendant."
3.0,"It fits on the shin as expected, though overall I think the product maybe is just of iffy design. Something like this would serve better on the thigh, and it did not fit comfortably on mine, although I am pretty small. So, I mean, yes, the item is what it's supposed to be and will fit a small to medium sized adult as it should, but there are just better options out there, especially if you're planning to travel in the summer."
3.0,"Overpriced, quality not good."
3.0,My shoe size is 8 but I was afraid the smaller size would be too small so ordered 8-10. Just washed them but haven‚Äôt worn them yet. May try putting them in the dryer. I like the weight and weave.
3.0,I tried on this necklace as soon as I got and I accidentally pulled on it and it snapped and broke. The necklace seemed pretty thick. I didn't think it would break but now I can't put it back together unless I buy another necklace to replace it.
3.0,I was really happy when I received the package and i was in love with the earrings..i thought best for the price but later when i started using them one the earring is doesnt fit in the post.. Not for long use..
3.0,it looks like it should. quality is not impressive but you do get what you pay for.  Its ok.  I'm not unhappy with the product nor was I overly impressed.
3.0,The quality of the product was five stars the idea and concept five stars. I just decided that I am not a fan of Spanx or any type of undergarments that restrict my movement.
3.0,Great shirt but if u have a big chest or back they ride up constantly. Really good quality.
3.0,hard to read low light
3.0,Quality is good. Color is good. Fit isn‚Äôt that great Bt manageable. I ordered xl
3.0,Hole in knee already. She wore it once. Bought for Valentine's Day.
3.0,"Great color, fits larger than expected."
3.0,The fit was not as expected.  It fit a lot tighter than a normal XL.  Particularly tight in the shoulder area.
3.0,"I rarely have a problem with hats being too small.  This fits really snug around my head, almost to the point of being uncomfortable, and there's no way to adjust it.  It's okay looking but not amazing.  I was hoping to use it for an upcoming vacation, but it's not going to work for me."
3.0,"I thought that this would be a plain white button up shirt dress. However, it has a slight crushed pattern. I got an XL and it was still fitting. Not ideal for shapely women. It is a nice shirt dress though."
3.0,This is very cute and the perfect size but unfortunately its not two sided so when it flips over its just flat.
3.0,"*UPDATED after lots of wearing & washing. Changing from 4 to 3 stars because this continues to get looser, even after washing and now slips off my head easily. I still like the material, absorbency, the dots on the inside that make this no slip, but its just too loose now.<br />________<br />I do yoga and sweat my butt off with sweat running all over my face and chest. This headband packs the sweat in and soaks it up. By the end of class its a different color and soaked, but does absorb throughout the class. Its nice and thin / not too thick and doesn't make you warm like some others. The width is great - most are really wide, but this one isn't tiny or overly wide. The inside of this has two rows of little sticky dots to make it not slip all around - but they aren't overwhelming either, so doesn't grab on hair or feel uncomfortable on the head.<br /><br />The reason for 4 vs. 5 stars is the size. This is a tad loose overall - I was hopeful after a few washings it would shrink, but no. If only about a 1/2 -1 inch less it would be perfect. Still its my favorite headband - after buying about 7 different ones and never being fully happy.''"
3.0,"I thought I was getting black! This was BROWN, I double checked with every member of my household just to make sure. Not like the picture. The fit was very boxy and wide and LONG (definitely a dress, not a tunic). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 155 pounds, and although very fit and muscular I would have needed a small for it to work."
3.0,I'm unimpressed by these. Although they are effective for the most part.. they are dollar store quality. The frames are smaller than I expected and the glare on these is probably the worst I've ever had. I'm not sure why that is because I generally dont get anti glare lenses and of course these aren't anti glare but this would be the first time I ever had a real issue with when not looking at a device at all but an actual paper book. I give 3 stars mostly because they are cute but that's about it. They just don't work effectively for me personally.
3.0,"These are actually really comfy and my s/o really likes them, only downside is that they shrink. Noticeably. I'd say size up- usually a large, should've gotten XL. Never even ran them hot in the dryer."
3.0,"Beautiful dress, simply doesn't fit my body type well. I'm 5'5 and this only goes to right above my ankles. Plus, I'm small up top a d this has an extra 1.5 inches hanging off each side extra. The material isn't stretchy so u need to stuff it somehow. Too bad."
3.0,These things are tiny!! Don't fit
3.0,"I wanted the sun protection from the long sleeves, but I returned it bc the bottoms looked ridiculous on me. Haha"
3.0,"I'm start by saying, this is a great quality, comfortable, soft smooth feel, nice design, however, for the size, it runs small at least on the waist. Got an XL and could barely close it, never had an issue with xl, sometimes when a large will work for me. Length wise was fine."
3.0,"The cup is ordinary, seems overpriced.  It took a long time but the cup arrived in good condition."
3.0,"Cute skirt, but made for someone with a tiny Asian body. The skirt is quite thin; it is basically see-through. Returned."
3.0,"It was really pretty, but I'm allergic to the bracelet"
3.0,Did not last very long before they started to come apart
3.0,"Thought this had a pocket like others of similar style. My error, it did not. Would add another star if had pocket. Think all pants and skirts should have pockets. Design on fabric a subtle red, blue, almost apoears like a solid color. runs slightly large. This line designed for straighter figure. larger waist or narrower hips."
3.0,"UPDATE: The seller contacted me and offered to send a new band at no extra cost.  While the new band is having the same issue (The clips for the band do not lock into the sockets for the watch - So the band eventually falls off while wearing it) I have upgraded my score to 3 stars for the effort by the company to resolve the issue.  I cannot say if it is the band or possibly my watch, although I haven't had any issues with Samsung made bands, but other people that have purchased the band have said it works.  So I will chalk up my experience as some anomaly and wish the seller the best of luck.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST: The connector doesn't stay connected to the watch very well.  My watch fell off the band a couple of times (Didn't break thankfully) before I finally stopped using it."
3.0,light and simple
3.0,"As bags go it's OK.  The photo isn't accurate as to color.  It's not burgundy.  It's more of a painted dark red with BRIGHT brass fittings.  The center zipper compartment is hard brittle plastic.  The photo makes the bag look more expensive and well made.  When you receive it, it's obviously not high end, but for the price it's OK, although the inside mini-pockets aren't large enough to hold a cell phone or keys.  Love the leather smell!"
3.0,"Love the dress - great color, material and style, but it fit smaller than similar dresses so I will return it."
3.0,"Colors are a little off from the rest of my Texas burnt orange. Also, the product is not in a bag, or otherwise covered. There was some contamination (dirty marks) on some of the pieces."
3.0,I don't like the size options. I feel like combining small and medium isnt a good idea.
3.0,Received them 2 days after ordering. The packaging was super cute! Bracelets are adorable but from a distance. Very cheap made. And lettering is faded.<br />Not good quality.
3.0,done the job
3.0,"A little on the small side, should have sized up. Quality was okay, but still super cute!"
3.0,Nice suit however I was disappointed in the quality of the workmanship.  For example the zipper was not sewn in the garment straight... the lining in the boy shirt was not complete only half lined.  The side seams are not sewn straight... making the suit fit uncomfortable.
3.0,"This is compression wear, very form fitting and not flattering. Would be good under something or if you like a tight fit."
3.0,Came on time fit fine but...was ripped at the seam on the right arm. Design is awesome though.
3.0,"Not well made. You can get a few slaps in, but they start looking bent up after that. Perfect for a kids party or class party where you need to buy in bulk, but don‚Äôt expect it to last a long time"
3.0,"Nice and tight on my floppy belly,  but that also means it flattens my boobs."
3.0,Cute dress but the color is not the same as the picture
3.0,Super long! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and the dress drags on the floor. I had to knot it at the bottom to prevent from stepping on it. It‚Äôs a bit cheap looking. I washed it a few times and it‚Äôs already faded but for the price it‚Äôs okay.
3.0,"I loved the picture, but I am a size xl. So I ordered a xl and it falls off of me. It's made big. And I didn't know it was going to be so White, I thought it was off white.so much cuter in the picture than it is in real life."
3.0,I loved the watch but the band is getting frayed and it can't be replaced according to my watch guy.  Its to unusual a size.
3.0,"I spent the first day wearing it repairing the bodice.  The boning came out in the front, and I had to stitch it back in while manning my renaissance booth.  Overall, nice looking.  The skirt is very sheer, so make sure you wear something underneath.  Also make sure you bring a needle in thread in case you need to make repairs."
3.0,"I bought this for a Halloween costume for my husband. He found it to be too tight and uncomfortable. He ended up only wearing it for photos. The next day my daughter wanted to wear it as part of her costume. She's 4 with a small head. She too complained that it was too tight and hurt her head. She was also only able to wear it for photos. I tried to stretch it out, I heard some seems rip... it was still to tight to be enjoyed. I didn't want to risk ruining it as I hadn't taken photos yet so I left it as is. I wouldn't buy this again. It wasn't comfortable for my toddler or husband. I understand one size fits most but if it's not even large enough to fit a toddler comfortably I'm not sure who it would fit.<br /><br />It was otherwise well made. There were no lose threads or other damage. The item received matched the item in the listing photos."
3.0,"I bought 3 pairs of red and 1 pair of green and returned 2 pairs of the red.  Why you ask?  It's because all the  boots came with pretty bad, black scuff marks around the red (or green) areas.  I was able to easily rub off the black marks off the green pair, but 2 of the red pairs looked too tacky to keep when the stains did not come off with all my attempts.  My 3rd pair of red boots had scuff marks but it was only in one place and I decided I could live with it.  I tried rubbing it off too, but no success.  I wish the boots weren't poorly made or poorly handled to have scuff marks on ALL their boots. :(<br /><br />Now to the actual review of the shoes:<br /><br />These are very cute and fashionable Bottega Veneta duplicates, except they're not $1500 like the originals.  I got these at only $50.  Also, the boots seem like they won't last that long (especially with really rough wear, so be gentle!), but they're so cute that I had to keep them.<br /><br />I'm 5'3"" and 113 lbs (small frame) and got the size 6.5.  These boots are very comfy for me.  They're also very chunky, but that's the style and I need to balance it out with wider leg jeans and/or a larger sweater.  The shoes do squeak when I walk on the tile floors of my house.  I can imagine them squeaking even more at my job where the floors are waxed.<br /><br />To sum it up, these are cute and comfy, but slightly on the poorly-made side.  I still suggest getting them if you want to be fashionable and like that chunky style."
3.0,"Cute shirt but fits small, and in weird spots."
3.0,subpar construction (bulky seems) and shorter than expected length
3.0,Not the quality I expected. Fabric is a bit too shiny for my taste. The sheen makes the skirt appear quite cheap in appearance. The waist was also a bit bulky. The design needs a little more atreamlining for a smoother transition from top to skirt.
3.0,Lite broke on one shoe right away. They were a gift to a friend's daughter so never knew they stopped lighting up until it was too late to return
3.0,"I'm kind of wishing I returned them for the price they are but missed the window. The description says gray mirrored lenses... They are not mirrored at all. There's white glue or paint near the hinges on the plastic. And you'd expect at this price point that it would be spring hinges but they are not. Overall, I love the style of them and they feel pretty solid, but it's the type of plastic that with the right impact, seems like it would break easily. I have to drop a star for the inaccurate description saying mirrored because that's what I really wanted. And drop another star for the quality defects. Lens quality does seem decent and a darker one, which can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. I feel these are more worth a $20 price point, not $50."
3.0,"Sizing is completely off. Ordered an XL, which is my usual size, and couldn't even get it over my head. However, the sweater is super cute and nice soft material! Will be exchanging for two sizes up."
3.0,"Let's get the cons out of the way first:<br />- Metal around the edges of the band is fraying - the sharp metal frays can snag on sheets, clothing, and can snag/stab, but doesn't affect wearer. i took a crimping tool to pinch the metal wiring and flatten it but it doesn't seem to work...<br />- the magnet that holds the watch band can loosen during physical activity that involves high vibration (such as mountain biking or gravel biking)<br />- due to the above reasons, it seems overpriced.<br /><br />the pros:<br /><br />- design is sleek and nice<br />- feels good to wear<br />- material overall is sturdy<br /><br />I would tell all of these above things (pros AND cons) to someone looking at watch straps, and tell them to make an informed decision. I would NOT tell to them to buy this, but I also would NOT tell them not to buy it. Neutral stance. In the coming weeks, I will be looking at other watch straps."
3.0,"The first time it was used the back of the seat bent. I bought 2 of them the other one is fine, so not sure what bent on the first one have not look to see that happened to it."
3.0,"These shoes are really pretty looking out of the box.  However, they run wide (I have a wide foot so this was a plus for me), as well as long in length.  I‚Äôd say order at least a half a size down.  If you have narrow feet, these shoes might not work at all for you, unfortunately.  My biggest issue with these sandals is that when you step, they make a weird ‚Äúburping‚Äù sound.  I‚Äôm guessing this is the air releasing between the foam and elastic banding.  Because you can‚Äôt adjust the elastic strap to make it tighter, there‚Äôs no way to stop this noise from happening.  At least not for me and the way I walk!  So, these great looking and extremely comfortable sandals had to be returned.  Perhaps others have better luck!"
3.0,"Cute top. Cheap quality, but looks more expensive from a distance. Only planning on wearing it for going out, and I only expect to get a few wears out of it. Fabric is really itchy, and the scalloping around the hem I awkward and not aligned very well. Took some time to trim the access mesh fabric around the lace and I'm planning on switching out the weird noodle-like neck string with a gold ribbon. Not exactly as pictured, I was pretty disappointed with the quality unfortunately. One of the instances where you get what you pay for!"
3.0,Not a huge fan of the black and the dark purple but overall ok in quality. I wish you had the option to pick the colors of the stone plugs when bought multiple like this.
3.0,This is not a dress. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and the item would work better with leggings.
3.0,It's pretty but it's still in my closet; I cannot figure out how to fasten it.  HELP?
3.0,Nice design looks good. Wallet space for cash too small :(
3.0,You get what you pay for. Some of them came with the battery already dead. The picture is true how they look. I would be hesi
3.0,"Size wise it fits , however in the photo it showed a longer length and that‚Äôs not what I have !! Deliver was very fast a little disappointed üòû"
3.0,On the design and style ‚Äì these definitely get five stars. The problem is with the sizing. They are either way too big or way too small it's very hard to find a good fit. I have bought and returned these shoes now for the fourth time ‚Äì trying to find a good fit for my niece and daughter. Honestly don't have great advice to give you about ordering shoes except order two sizes from the beginning and return the one that doesn't fit.
3.0,Cute design and decent material! My issue is I got a medium and for whatever reason my nipple continues to fall out and slip out.
3.0,"Does the job, but I expected the YELLOW lenses. These aren't much different than the ones I use during bright daylight hours. Not quite what i expected. Personally, I do not think they are accurately advertised as night glasses."
3.0,"Cheap Material,  But for the price I should not have expected more ."
3.0,"Very small, not breathable fabric but it is very cute"
3.0,Comfy but runs big.
3.0,Very cute. Very heavy! They hurt my ears and I have to take them out after an hour or so.
3.0,"Nice quality shirt.  Worth the money.  They run extremely small.  I wear a large and I ordered a xxx, and it just fits.  Jut remember that when you order.  I would buy again."
3.0,The dress is pretty see-through. But if I wear a camisole under it's just fine.
3.0,Bought this to replace and old Totes umbrella. The quality is not nearly as good. Guess I should have bought a more expensive one.
3.0,"Too large and cumbersome plus my phone won't fit. Disappointed, I was only looking for wristlet."
3.0,One pair of earrings has properly drilled holes making it so that the earring will not latch at all. Other pairs close properly and fit well.
3.0,It's a pretty cute dress and seems to be of decent quality (white doesn't show through). Runs true to size. My only complaint is that the fabric in the under arm comes up very high! I would think it was too small except the dress fits everywhere else perfectly.
3.0,"Cute, but the zipper malfunctioned and I couldn‚Äôt move it. Returned the costume."
3.0,"Cute and comfy tank top, fits a little small. It's not loose like the picture shown."
3.0,Too long for small ears and do not stay in place unless you bend them.
3.0,"I ordered this is a gift for my wife. This necklace is very pretty, if a bit fragile, but I‚Äôm a little creeped out that I paid $98 for it, and when I opened the box, it had a $50 price tag on it."
3.0,"Inexpensively made coveralls, that are fine for a costume or light duty wear.  Not for working in!  I think they are overpriced for the quality you receive."
3.0,I will be able to wear these - but they seem not to be designed for North American men.
3.0,"Run small, very small"
3.0,"I went off the measurements and it still didn't fit me well. I'm 5'1 with a chest of 36 D, 140. The fit was ok except in the chest, just felt too tight for me. Length was too long for my liking. If I was taller, it may of fit a lot better. Maroon color is gorgeous though."
3.0,Item was thinner/Smaller than I needed. Cant put much in it.
3.0,Too small and I ordered an extra large.
3.0,"Tight fit,  kinda looks like boats on my feet.  Also thought the straps were velcro.  They snap awkwardly with multiple holes.  Kind of a pain in the butt , feel as if I could definitely just tie them faster... defeats purpose of being a slip on. They look kool tho"
3.0,"Super adorable and we got compliments on them every time our daughter wore them out.  Unfortunately, the little bow tie things that came on them ripped off of both shoes almost immediately.  A 2 year old should not be able to pull them off that easily."
3.0,Nice sunglasses. Just not the right fit for me.
3.0,"It fits kinda funny fitting. Kind of larger than expected. I got a small and it seems like a large. I'm 5'4 and at about 120lbs.<br />I figured I'd keep it for the days I feel bloated. I didn't realize but the back of the shirt is long so covers the fanny. The front is at a normal length but real roomy---maybe too roomy. Like I said, its okay for days you still want to look a little put together but feel bloated---for your &#34;blah days or nothing fits days&#34;"
3.0,"The fitment is a little weird on this, but still comfy and looks good."
3.0,kind of a weird ft IMO
3.0,Smaller than I thought. Bought these for my septum piercing and the balls just show outside of my nose. I have a pretty small nose too. So probably wouldn't recommend these for a septum. They do seem good quality though.
3.0,I did not receive the micro fiber bags for the sunglasses. I bought 3 pair and no micro fiber bags with any of them!
3.0,"Had em for two weeks and stepped on rebar, it went right thru!<br />Couldn't believe how easily it popped right thru at the ball of my foot. Hopped around trying to get un-impaled for 20 seconds then got it off. This was a 12"" piece of rebar used as a stake, only half way into the dirt!<br />This is not a work duty sole!"
3.0,A bit more frustrating to use than what was pictured. But I'll still give them a try for my two week trip!
3.0,"The bag looks nice. That‚Äôs what drew me to this product. However, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with the amount of slack the laptop pouch has. The velcro on the front of the flap sits unusually high and is limited to a square instead of a strip, which defeats the purpose of the elastic strap. The flap itself has a lot of slack as well."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:24d47da5e8e5296443bdb40edd5567ad]] Update:  The replacement costume also came damaged. If you want the hoop to flare out the dress, this is not for you. At this point we are going to cut it out and just use a petticoat.  I love the look of this dress just not the hoop.<br /><br />I had been sent a damaged product and the company reached out to me to make it right. The costume looks GREAT."
3.0,I got the mens 3x and it's not even a mens L could bearly get it on ler alone over my boobs looking great feels nice but its going to end up all my wall of jack stuff ..
3.0,"Keep your expectations low- the dress is wearable but it's not as pictured. The lace is bigger patterned and kind of netted/plastic feeling and the skirt is made of that super light thin material like bad Walmart sheets. It's cut ok if you are small in the chest. At 5&#34;7, it sits a little awkwardly high and pulls on the buttons for a c cup (I irdered XL for that purpose even though I'm a m-l in most things but it still pulls in the chest only). For a dinner that's not a big deal occasion, I wouldn't throw this dress away but it should have cost a lot less and is not going to make you happy for any important dress event."
3.0,The pendant is a little crooked and the necklace is not what I expected.
3.0,Cute but I wish I would have bought it a little bigger.
3.0,"My only annoyance: there were no descriptions stating whether these could be torn off or not. The buttons seen at the waist in the pic are not functional. However, they fit just fine and look great (5' 3"", 100 lbs)."
3.0,Okay blouse but too much work to bother with on a regular basis. Wrinkles easily and needs ironing no matter how gingerly you launder.
3.0,The absolute best lenses for computers and tv
3.0,I LOVED this band but the silver clatch fell off after only 2 weeks so that was a real bummer. Thought about ordering another one but probably not smart.
3.0,"Great hoodie, but runs small."
3.0,There ok but I found a pair of slip-ons at Walmart for $14 that were more comfortable. So I ware those instead.
3.0,I think for the price is what you get. The mask bends half way down the face revealing your eyes and nose due to the material is not sturdy but it‚Äôs just while the child has fun playing with it .
3.0,Needs side pockets
3.0,"These shorts are only flattering on women who gain weight in their lower half. For women like me who gain more  in belly, arms, back  etc.... these shorts will make you look lumpy because of where the elastic is at."
3.0,"The bands are slightly smaller than  the original, the fit on the watch is good but would have rather it to be bigger as closer to the original."
3.0,Cute not all the same size and a little big for my 5yr old.
3.0,Love the look but not very comfortable. Husband says they wore blisters on his feet
3.0,Cute but fits too small so I returned it.
3.0,"Probably too thin to wear for bike shorts, but great for under things."
3.0,"My 7 month daughter wears 6 month clothing, so i purchased this in 3-6 months. it was wayyy to big on her, I recommend going a size or two down"
3.0,"It was okay... it served my purpose, but I had feathers dropping off all day.  I sprayed it with hairspray and it was still a mess."
3.0,Runs a little small and material is kind of thin
3.0,"The fit is great.  It's not too loose, not too snug and the material is nice and thick. Only issue, even before washing it, threads started to come loose in certain areas.  Since it's knit, that's not an easy fix, but since it's black, it's not completely noticeable."
3.0,Must be aware that garment is made in China and it is sized for small Asian people
3.0,The headband functions as described without any big plusses or minuses. The footage I get when using the headband is sometimes a little jittery&mdash;any vibrations or shaking in the body while recording seems to extend through the head and into the camera more than I expected. Not much else to say.
3.0,Beautiful but let's just say you pay for what you get.
3.0,It's a typical print tee but perfect for Schitts lovers
3.0,"Not as nice as pictures look,  very thin material,  it fit right except under the arms it bunches out,  tried on and never wore because there is no way to fix it,"
3.0,"Top fit, bottoms were GRANNY PANIES.  ew."
3.0,Ends pulled off easily could hold  very little weight
3.0,"All were what I expected. Generic belly rings.  Unfortunately the one long, dangly one was missing stones."
3.0,"Liked the carved stone, didn't much care for the neck cord."
3.0,"Very comfortable on 3 hour+ rides, fits as Castelli chart says. Logo on right leg started coming off after first wash (warm water, hang to dry indoors). Now 10 wears/washings in the scorpion logo is off completely and the right leg logo is half gone.<br /><br />Perfect for those who like comfort but not looking like you just bought new bibs."
3.0,"Very nice  , delicate . Difficult to Stay in the ear."
3.0,It was a gift for my son and he wont wear it. Its too plasticky
3.0,"Fit was a little big, sleeves were baggie."
3.0,Costs too much for what it is listed for. The crystal isn't even weighty plastic.
3.0,"a bit of my heel hangs over the back of the soul, its kinda of annoying"
3.0,Very cheaply made: you get what you pay for.<br />I had to get me son to help me open the clasp.
3.0,"If you are of ethnic background, you will need to order 1 but preferably 2 sizes larger. My child is a healthier 5 yo that uses size 7-8 clothing, so i bought the comparable size and it was too small! She will never be able to use again...waisted money and time."
3.0,"Pretty, but much larger and longer than expected.  It is NOT a choker necklace."
3.0,pockets need to be deeper.  Tilts and spills.  Too heavy.
3.0,The hearts were Bigger than I expected but very pretty n came on time.
3.0,The black color came out fairly quickly. The chain broke after the first year. Guess that's not TOO bad for a cheaply made necklace. But... Just expect it.
3.0,Not what I expected. On the flimsy side. Had a time figuring out if it was a shawl or poncho. It was a gift for someone and I wasn't too pleased with it.
3.0,"Okay so these are really nice gloves, thick enough but also thin enough and not made out of cheep material BUT when I got them they smelled incredibly badly of ROTTING FISH. Legitimately that was the smell, it was incredibly distinct and disgusting. I had to run them through the wash and dryer TWICE to get out the smell. All I have to say is WHY????"
3.0,"Got a 12 for my 10 year old and it doesn‚Äôt fit. It looks like it‚Äôs for an 8 year old instead. My daughter is on the taller side why I got a 12, but it was still way too small. It‚Äôs a nice looking swimsuit otherwise."
3.0,"Nice comfortable shirt. The only problem is it‚Äôs really short in the front. If you raise your arms slightly, it shows your belly. There aren‚Äôt any tags sewn inside the shirt, so to fix the issue, I wear it backwards. You can‚Äôt tell the difference except backwards, if you raise your arms, your belly doesn‚Äôt show since the back is much longer."
3.0,Very thin material.<br />Ordered bigger in case shirt was smaller... and it was.
3.0,The fit was perfect.  The material wasn't as expected.  I felt like I was wearing a choral gown. Sent it back.
3.0,Purse looked lighter color on line.  It is heavy even when empty.
3.0,Watch is nice quality. Face is large as advertised. Not great for poor eyesight. I got it because of the large numbers but the hands are not large. I can see the numbers perfect but I can't tell the time because the hands get lost in all the other lines on the face. Gave it to my nephew and he loves it because he has great eyesight. Great fashion watch...not good for bad eyes.
3.0,"The gloves that I received came in two separate colors. The color difference is not drastic so I don't mind that much. They're also a little big so I have to pull the fabric down in order for the touch screen part to work. Overall they're okay and keep my hands fairly warm,"
3.0,okay for a teenage kid
3.0,"Bought these in purple.  Love the color and materials.  For me these fit a little weird.  They are narrow in the toe, but wide in the back.  My toes are pinched, but they slip off the back.  I'm hoping the toes will stretch.  I do have wide feet, so the width in the front would be fine for many, but I can't imagine these not slipping off everybody in the back.  Length seems pretty standard.  One other thing I'm not so crazy about is that the bottom is suede with individual ""grippies"" sewn in.  There is not one solid sole.  This would be a problem if you occasionally wear them outside to get the mail, etc.  They are not outside shoes at all.  I will try to wear them, but I would not buy again, just because of the back slipping off."
3.0,The skirt is not bad at all compair to it's price but runs very small. I purchased 3 skirts in 2 different size for my students and all is so tight in waist and short.. my girls are average 11 years ols and I am not happy..
3.0,Love it but a bit small
3.0,Cute dress but runs tight. If you purchase you will need to go up a size. Great material. I have to my daughter because it was too tight.
3.0,"They hurt like hell, the edges are so rough. They bend easily to open but I can't even wear them because they hurt when you try to close em on your nose."
3.0,looks more like a training bib or penny for sports teams.  It's pretty thin and you can see through it.  Plus it's not soft on your skin.  It's not like they cost a lot.  Now I know why.
3.0,The teardrops are nothing like what is in the picture. I purchased the Christmas choice. The red teardrops are missing the layering silver and gold pieces. One had already broke and they don‚Äôt hang the correct way on my ear.
3.0,I love the socks but they are a bit small in the toes. The problem is that it constricts blood flow at the base of the toes. There is not enough ease there and I don't have fat feet or toes either. But I love the bottoms that have skid proofing so you don't slide around in flip flops or regular shoes. I am currently making expansions for the toe parts so I can wear them in comfort. Maybe I missed something about the size that should be ordered. I will have to go back and look.
3.0,It's really heavy and the bracelet tarnished after wearing it twice
3.0,"This worked for its intended purpose, however when I used it, it was an extremely hot day and I had on a white tank top- which was completely ruined with black streaks by the end of the day. I don‚Äôt wear recommending light colors -probably only black. It was comfortable to wear so I don‚Äôt have complaints about that. Price was good. Just watch out for the color to bleed all over"
3.0,"Beautiful tooled leather but way, way too small for a Droid Turbo smart phone. Returned it within hours of receiving."
3.0,"I ordered these in a Xl and XXL. The XXL ran small so had to return. I liked the waist band, but the fabric was AWFUL. Like thick tissue paper (if you can imagine). Not at all soft."
3.0,A little bigger than I had expected (it's pretty wide) but the quality is good
3.0,"Material is good, bit oversized for me. The elbow patch should have been thicker material."
3.0,Really small for the price. I thought it was going to be a little bigger like a heavy key chain of good quality. It still looks cool! The metal is a cheaper lighter metal. I hung it on my backpack but if you wanted to add it to actual keys at least they won't weight a ton.
3.0,"While the pendant was gorgeous, this was a birthday gift for my friend.  I loved it for the card that was supposed to go with the pendant.  The card with the poem was not with the pendant.  I was bummed that the card wasn't with the pendant and my friend missed out on it."
3.0,Quality is excellent!  I had to return it because the fit is extraordinarily small. I usually would wear an extra small and ordered a medium. I couldn‚Äôt hardly get it on. I think I would‚Äôve had to order an extra large.. But they get very very high scores for quality. It is beautiful fabric. If you‚Äôre a very small woman. I would give this a 10 star.
3.0,"Omg! Short! Really really short. Like, 'don't you dare bend down in this' short."
3.0,I was not a fan of the material thought. I didn't think the price was worth it. I bought a large. I am 5'6 and 145 pounds and a large was pretty tight.
3.0,It's fitted. Get one size up to wear as a dress. Material is see through.
3.0,"The pendant is small, but perfectly sized for my needs. I was actually concerned that it would be too big. My problem is, I specifically chose this item because it is listed as being on a snake chain. Which, while not as sturdy as a box chain, are fairly sturdy. This is not a snake chain by any stretch of the imagination and I will be forced to purchase a stronger chain.<br />I included my thumbnail in the photo for size reference. As some may be concerned about that."
3.0,Soy size 8 y solo una me qued√≥. Las dem√°s muy peque√±as
3.0,The only issue is that it runs about a size too small which renders it rather uncomfortable
3.0,Medium fits just right but with no room for slightly covering knees more without showing underwear. The waist is true to size but the overall length of the shorts leaves more to be more desired.
3.0,Me gusto el grosor de la tela todo muy bien execto porque viene m√°s peque√±a de lo normal recomiendo utilizar una talla m√°s
3.0,They are very thick with a ribbed texture that leave impressions on my legs the stockings are helpful in reducing swelling and leg fatigue but I don't think I will buy them again
3.0,"It's an okay shirt. It seems to be a real licensed product, but the fit is not as good as a different licensed one I ordered. This shirt is a little large for the size but not too much. It's the sleeves that I really don't like. They are much too big (not too long, just much too loose). The shirt is well-made. I just personally don't like the fit. Also the graphic is a little stiffer than I was hoping, but it's not too bad. And it does look good. I'll wear it, and I do consider it worth the price I paid."
3.0,Super big on my husky size 8 year old. Like WAY too big. Fit for a teen
3.0,For the price they were I would not complain.  I like the feel of the tops and the soles are just what I was looking for.
3.0,The numbers are reversed in the size chart
3.0,"Quality is not the best, but okay for the price. A few broke really easily already."
3.0,"It served it's purpose. I wore it at a celtic festival for a weekend. If fell apart the day after the festival. It's much cheaper than it looks in the picture. This is disposable jewelry.  It the bracelet's defense, I did wear it in the pool all weekend during the festival.  Maybe' it's not designed for chlorine."
3.0,I take a size 4 X  So if you assume I have a gut you are right. A 4X fits fine if you dont plan on buttoning it.  The sizing does not allow for girth. I‚Äôm keeping mine because I will wear it unbuttoned but I had rather have that option.  Overall the vest is made very well.
3.0,I ordered this dress hoping to have something other than slacks to wear to the office. I read several reviews and was torn between ordering a med or a large. I went with the med.I love the DRESS but the fit for me was really bad. The arms for the dress were to small for my arms. I wear a med in blouses and still try them on because of the cut in the upper arms. This dress had the same issue. My second issue comes at the waste I have a small one. its really hard to find pants that don't gap because well I have junk in the trunk and a 26' in waste. So the waste in this dress would fit most normal people just not me. The skirt is real full too which I liked it hide the hips well. I really do love the look of this dress just not made for my body type.
3.0,But...the card inside this pink wallet said that it DOES NOT have RFID Blocking.
3.0,Very pretty but does NOT fit a Pandora bracelet.
3.0,"The AmeriMark Women‚Äôs Classic Plaid Big Shirt is made from 100% cotton but it is extremely thin. So thin, in fact, that it probably will not last more than a year with regular wear. It works great with a shirt underneath it by adding color and plaid, but I am fairly disappointed with it. The shirt definitely does not add any warmth like it mentions for cooler autumn days. It also ran a bit small, particularly in the upper arms and shoulders. I guess they don't think women can have broad shoulders! Overall, it's an okay shirt but it's not one I would necessarily recommend unless you are looking for a lightweight, long-sleeved plaid shirt."
3.0,"I'm 5' 10"", 180 lbs, 38C and wear a 10/12 for dresses and pants. Ordered a large per the sizing chart. The entire shirt barely covered my chest, and covered none of my stomach. The underbust seam was more of a mid bust seam. Size Up!!!"
3.0,I thought it was supposed to change color when it rained. So far it hasn't. Maybe it has to be a cold rain.
3.0,"it's not light pink it's darker.... and less decorations on a side, i think."
3.0,This is a dress sock.  It does not work well for hiking and other activities.
3.0,"This dress is so cute, and incredibly comfortable! I was really wanting it to work for me. Unfortunately, I felt the small fit more like a medium! It was too big for me."
3.0,Got good. Every little thing smash the material. Had large snag across chest first time I wore it.
3.0,"The top is too small in the torso, but fit alright in the arms. Too tight in the bust area and considering the length, its too tight around the hips. The bottoms fit a smidge better, but they were somewhat tight in the buttocks. My husband likes how the shorts look, though. I was really looking forward to this outfit, but it didn't fit very well. So I'm a little bummed about it."
3.0,The handbag was well made but it was HUGE! Not what I expected.
3.0,I do not like that they have elastic on the back waistband...very tacky! The description did not say this.
3.0,"I don‚Äôt like the material, it‚Äôs to scratchy for me."
3.0,"The last pair I bought have carving on both side which I loved, that‚Äôs why I ordered these. And to my disappointment they are only carved on one side."
3.0,"The strap doesn't stay buckled. I had to sew it. Unique shirt however, but the quality is just average."
3.0,"Ahi dice que incluye las calcetas y no es verdad , mi orden llego sin las calcetasüòî"
3.0,"This shirt is more cotton/silky like. It looks more stiff in the picture, but this shirt is actually pretty flowy and baggy. Doesn't fit like the picture, either. It will shape more to you than give the boxy look as pictured. Slightly disappointed."
3.0,Just got mine out the mail and it's cute and all but the picture makes it look like it the snake is bigger so for that I'm a little disappointed..
3.0,My husband collects pocket watches. I bought this one in December of 2009 and already the stone is terribly scratched and the locking clasp no longer works so the watch often falls open. A nice to look at watch but not an everyday use watch.
3.0,I bought two of these hats only thing they did not last long broke within 3 months
3.0,"Was too tight under the armpits, would have returned if I had remembered in the return window."
3.0,Pretty glasses. Sunglasses case is badly made. Or sunglasses were switched to a new case which is vet fitted and almost too small.
3.0,Very very thin material not worth the money poorly Made!
3.0,"I‚Äôm all about dainty gold jewelry lately.<br /><br />Forgive the close-up of my ear. These are really tiny and sweet but I‚Äôm going to give them to my 7yo probably. She just got her ears pierced and she will love these for Christmas.<br /><br />If you‚Äôve got multiple earlobe piercings they would be great for that second or third hole but are too small and dainty for me as a primary earring, they just look too juvenile somehow.<br /><br />The plus side is that they aren‚Äôt as likely to snag on masks so if you‚Äôre still wearing them regularly in public to prevent catching COVID variants you might try studs.<br /><br />I like the sort of floral shape, more interesting than a solitaire stud. Nice box for gifting. Shown with Kleenex box for scale only."
3.0,It is flimsy but I also didn't read the description.  And it came on Halloween so it was folded and didn't really fit properly(my ordering mishap)  its a nice mask though!
3.0,"Makes a really cute Minnie Mouse outfit but to be honest I was surprised when it arrived and it was only the skirt. Not sure how I missed that but I had thought it would be the whole dress. Ordered smallest size and it was a bit too big, I am normally a size 0 though."
3.0,The pendant is just beautiful.  I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the chain breaks my neck out in a rash.  I have ordered a black silk ribbon necklace and can't wait till I get it so I can where my pendant again.  I don't know how easy it was to fill as my funeral director did it for me.
3.0,These were a great price.  Not quality.
3.0,"I liked its fit. But none of my children would wear it due to saying it made their torso feel it was on fire, just a very WARM shirt."
3.0,Runs very small. I bought it for my son but it fits my daughter that wears an extra small very well. She loves it. Says it‚Äôs comfortable and warm however I wish it had fit my son who actually needed it.
3.0,"I do like them, but they are not as nice as the older ones."
3.0,"It's cheap, my wrist is kind of in between sizes, so fully open a bit of a squeeze to slip wrist through.  Band tends to stay wet when it gets wet, doesn't seem to try as quick as some  other styles."
3.0,Picture does not match product. Cover up was wearable but not as appealing.
3.0,"The filter pocket is on the wrong side, so the rainbows are upside down when worn. Otherwise it would be a much cuter product. Seems usable any way though."
3.0,"When I received these earrings I was impressed with the quality and style. I wore them one evening and received many compliments. Unfortunately, I tried to wear them a second time and they would not close properly and kept falling off. Be aware, the gold part that fits through your ear is very delicate, soft and easy to bend. They are now unable to close properly. Very disappointed!"
3.0,"Goods received well. However, I am sorry that you do not include anything besides sunglasses. It is better to delete the components that are not included in the product description section. :)"
3.0,"Super cute and comfy, but hand wash and hang dry if you want to wear them more than once"
3.0,Slid off the post and had a hard time putting the backs on so i cut them down a little and e6000 glued them on which seems to have done the trick. Now my girls dance earrings dont make her ears hurt and get inflamed and infected.  They do need the ear holes to be a lil bigger then peirced size but most peoples holes are a little stretched anyways so just know its going to be a tight fit the first few times you wear them and they need trimming.
3.0,I have a big face so was skeptical about these but they give me deli vibes. Love the look but not meant for seeing haha the frame gets in the way of lens because it‚Äôs thicker. Don‚Äôt recommend for everyday
3.0,It was cheap and it's cute - quality is fine for the money.
3.0,These run small!  My son wears a 2.5 so I ordered a 3 and they are too small.
3.0,The clasp fell off the 1st day I wore it an I can't put it back together without any tools
3.0,"I ordered a Large but this dress has alot of Stretch so I should have ordered a Meduim, I could of even gotten away with a Small. I'm 5'9 at 172LBS, 38D"
3.0,"i love this pendant, but its very fragile and it feels like its about to just crumble to pieces if touched. im afraid to wear it, and afraid to touch it."
3.0,Wasn't expecting it to appear so cheaply. But for the price why expect more right?
3.0,Too cheap. Too small. Or maybe she‚Äôs eat eating too many tacos.....
3.0,"I really like this bag, but I would change a few things about it. I am your 'average american woman' - a size 14, 5'9&#34; with a really long torso. Ideally, I need the strap to be about 3-4 inches longer. I do love the two outside pockets, but there is only one, small interior pocket. The inside is big enough to have at least one, if not two more pockets. It's easier to find little things, instead of rooting around in a big bag full of small things.  Also, I have only carried the bag for 2 or 3 days and I have already lost one of the buckles that is attached to the front of the bag. I should have left them  connected to the strap, but it make it easier to get in and out of the bag, I unbuckled it. The buckles are held onto the bag by a magnetic snap, but it's not a very strong one. I also did not receive the coin purse that I was supposed to get with the bag. I will be contacting them for it."
3.0,"This was a super nice watch band. However, it broke within three months. First the leather ring that holds the excess strap broke, then the pin on the section that attaches to the Apple Watch broke. Super disappointing."
3.0,"I got these, however, I didn't like them one myself, so I gave them away., they were soft, and warm, might be tight, if the boots are snug, but, really great for cold, snowy days."
3.0,Very thin- bleeds- wrinkles even in hand wash-
3.0,"Great stuff, use it on my Red Wing and Chippewa boots. Glad they packed the can in a bag, leaked big time. At least the box wasn't soaked."
3.0,glasses seemed to big like i had bug eyes and didnt even fit in the case it was given in i still wear them they are nice glasses to wear even though they seem big
3.0,I bought an XL and it fit like a Large. The fabric is NOT stretchy at all...kinda stiff. The shirt is really cute but I would buy a larger size next time.
3.0,I can't raise my arms without my ass showing
3.0,The bows themselves are great quality and I love the assortment of colors. The problem was that these are supposed to be newborn sized but they are not. My baby is 5weeks old and she is in the 90th percentile for head size (that means her head her is big) and these bows are too big. I think they will be great once she can wear them but definitely don't order them for a tiny baby.
3.0,"I was first attracted to these goggles for their look. I really like the style and the idea of the fog proof and uv protection. We have an outdoor pool so we are always swimming and looking for good goggles. When I took them out of the package they looked exactly as they do in the picture which is great, but when my husband my daughter, and myself tried them on we all encountered the same problem. No matter how much you loosen or tighten the straps they slide down into an uncomfortable position in your eye socket. They straps are hard to tighten and loosen and the whole time I was sure I was going to snap the strap and break it. The ear plugs go into the ear smoothly but after a couple of minutes your ears start to hurt. The nose plug was too tight on my husband's nose but it fit fine on my 11 year old daughters nose. The only thing we did not try was the cap because no one in my family will wear one, but I did life the texture of the material and it is made well."
3.0,"the product quality is good, I've used it for one week and looks good, is comfortable, cool. the issue is that money is pretty tight I there and put and get money is not smooth."
3.0,Product does'nt look like the picture online.
3.0,"This product is ok.  There are several design issues.  First of all it is meant to be a crossbody bag, but the strap does not extend long enough so it sits too high.  Also, there are many pockets which in theory is a good thing, but the two pockets inside are always open and protrucing making it difficult to slide a wallet in and out of the bag."
3.0,These are loose fitting socks. I try wearing them with boots but they keep sliding down my leg.
3.0,"Ok I bought these knowing they‚Äôre a knockoff version of cute booty leggings...<br />I‚Äôve personally found better knockoffs than these. I also couldn‚Äôt tell by the picture (and no I didn‚Äôt read the material make up) that they‚Äôre slick athletic type material not a typical cottony blend. Usually I size up because of the scrunch in the butt being made a little too tight that it stretches flat when I wear the cute booty brand with these the fit was looser so I could have gotten my original size. Ended up returning because they just didn‚Äôt look as cute as some of the other pairs I can find on amazon, but I will say great customer service even through tough times"
3.0,It feels nice and I love the print. But it's just a bit too short for me. I'd like it to be longer. Got a medium and I'm 5ft5 inches.
3.0,"Sexy, but a little to tight"
3.0,"This arrived very quickly.  It was well packaged but it was a bit stiff.  Also, you should be careful that that purse isn't too heavy.  Since the &#34;adjustable strap&#34; is the kind with a buckle, any heavy purse pulls the hole of the strap open very easily.  I can still use this occasionally so I will keep it."
3.0,hard to weigh heavy things with the flimsy handle
3.0,It a little short in the back.
3.0,"My girlfriend loves this, but it's not as sturdy as you would help! One of the chains fell off the first one and has to be repaired in order to wear again"
3.0,Title says it. It's like 3 months subscriptions. ‚îë(Ôø£–î Ôø£)‚îç
3.0,"Product seems to fit as expected. Nice side pockets and feels very warm. However upon arrival one sleeve was not finished with stitching. First pic is stitching not finished, second pic is correct stitching. Guess I'll have to sew myself."
3.0,I still love this shirt even though it's because of the spandex in it. It is form fitting but it just a reminder for me that I just need to keep on working on losing some of my baby weight after having my 4th baby. Only two months postpartum. But the shirt is made good and looks just like the picture.
3.0,"These are nicely warm, very long (the cuff goes way down your forearm), however, it arrived with a hole on the top of one of the fingers on the right hand.  I can't be bothered with the hassle of returning it.  I'd probably have given this 4 stars except for the tear in it."
3.0,"These gloves still run a tad on the large size. My fingers still got cold with these. I'm keeping them, but only cause they're cheap. These are not the end all for gloves by any means."
3.0,"I bought this for myself and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I wear this everyday and get a lot of compliments. No stones have fallen out and the opal is still so beautiful ! However, wearing it everyday does break down the band quite a bit and I notice the silver color fading to brown as well as my finger turning green while wearing it but nothing noticeable. I suggest that if you do want this for everyday use then buy a matching silver spray paint, tape the stones up and clean the band. Or even a clear nail polish might help."
3.0,Hat was too small for my head. It should have various/ adjustable sizes. Not bad craftsmanship though.
3.0,"Sizing is weird. I ordered a large, the interior is a large, but the opening is not. I couldn't even get my head in without removing the padding. It's not an issue of it being he wrong size. As again, the interior is perfect size. Never had this issue before so I don't know what the deal is."
3.0,The item was too small but when you uh speak of beauty it was beautiful. Only issue the size was not as expected
3.0,"This shirt is relaxed fitted around the torso and on the arms. I felt like it fit close to size, but it is a very relaxed fit, so if someome is between sizes usually, you can probably get away with sizing down if you don't want it so billowing . Sleeves are approximately 3/4 sleeve length.<br /><br />The material is easy to see through, so wear should probably wear a cami  top under it. The lace mesh on the arms/shoulder and the thin torso material are very thin and best for warmer temps.<br /><br />There is a button that fastens at the back of the neck. An additional button is included attached to a tag inside the shirt."
3.0,It's gorgeous but way too big for a 5' 100lb person.
3.0,"This was for my 4 yr old, its fun for toys but not really good for packing for a trip. Maybe a weekend only."
3.0,Super cute suit but it's fairly thin.  If we hadn't needed it in a pinch I would've sent it back.
3.0,"Really liked the shirt, fabric and pattern was great but had to return it due to sizing. Ordered a child's XXL but it looked more like a child's medium. Ran very small, no way it would fit my son."
3.0,I was not very impressed with this ensemble.The fabric is nice and linen so it will wrinkle when you sit down over time. But I don't mind the shaggy look.I'm kind of shaped like a linebacker for a female so this did not compliment. My figure at all and made it look like I was about 8 months pregnant.I tried wearing it lower to make the crotch look like hammer pants but that just made things worse. I would recommend this for someone who's hips are wider than their shoulders. It just doesn't really look like. What's in the pictures.
3.0,"I have loved these pants. They are so comfortable, I love the side pockets. Imagine my surprise when I bent over in them in front of my sister and friend that they told me the pants were see through."
3.0,I love it but it took too long to be delivered.  I received it after the event that I attended. It would have gone perfectly with what I wore. I searched high and low for something close to this an d couldn't find anything. I ended up wearing no necklace.
3.0,"I bought this for my son who found it very comfortable and was very pleased with the length of the sleeves as most shirt sleeves are too short for him.<br /><br />It is somewhat see through, so I would definitely recommend a t-shirt be worn underneath it.  It did have slight, fine pilling after one washing.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount or free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion about this product.

3.0,Returns
3.0,One of them had a huge scratch on it but the others were fine.
3.0,what mm are these sunglasses?
3.0,"Nice basic bamboo garment but the gold buttons (one fell off) are quite difficult to affix into the holes provided! Also it would be nice to see a pocket on these. But for a basic top with the benefits of bamboo, it fits the bill. Just don't expect too much. The little cardboard case is a nice touch though! This makes a reasonably good pajama top too, it should keep you cool. It is supposed to be 3/4 length for the sleeves but it's probably more like 3/5ths. A bit snug, I got the XL instead of my usual L. So if you need something a little different and want to jump into the bamboo pool, give it a hop!"
3.0,"The color was the same as the picture but the fabric was too stiff, the shirt was way too big and the shorts were too small. My baby girl is 1.8 years and weights 12 kg."
3.0,Love the design. Fits my shoulders  nicely. A little snug across my middle.
3.0,"I wanted this to work so badly for me, but unfortunately the dress wore me and not the other way around. I‚Äôm petite (5‚Äô2‚Äù and 118lbs) and the dress sort of just enveloped me. I took tha guidance of everyone else and ordered a size up so perhaps that‚Äôs what the issue was. I even bought a belt to help cinch the waist. But the fit wasn‚Äôt the issue really, I could have dealt with the little bit of extra fabric that didn‚Äôt quite fit right...it was actually the boldness of the pattern that just made this a bit too loud for my liking. The theory around this dress is so sweet and lovely. It just wasn‚Äôt a fit for me."
3.0,"This purse/wallet is just what I was looking for -- something that would fit in my purse, but something I could carry (or use strap) for short trips without lugging everything around. Place for phone, coins, currency, stamps, etc. My only complaint is that everything is tight. I can barely get my driver's license in the slot. (I am going to hate to have to pull it out for ID), Credit card slots are so tight, I can barely get one in. I am used to being able to put two cards in one slot. Not here. I wish that Vera Bradley had made everything just 1/4 inch bigger so things would  fit better. I would return it but I have already started using it. Maybe I will get used to everything being so tight."
3.0,Dislike just didn't feel comfortable at all.
3.0,"It's small but I like it, Do you have a bigger size in this pattern?"
3.0,"The boots in the box were not the ones I ordered but they look like a good boot so if they fit my grandson, I will keep them. Same size that I had ordered but a different color and different brand"
3.0,"The workmanship isn't great. There was a hole on one of the seams and the fabric design doesn't line up at the seams, so needless to say it's not very well made.<br />I'm  not sure if I'm going to return the dress or possibly try to sew it myself. But I shouldn't have to sew it at the price I paid.<br />The style is nice and the fit is great though."
3.0,They were too long and had to get them shortened.
3.0,"This ring design is super comfortable and looks great, but unfortunately after a few days the metallic paint has noticeably worn off in some spots, especially the ""diamond"" part."
3.0,I love the look on the picture but the white part of the design only came up 2 inches from the bottom hem.  If it came up higher from the hem and the arms as the picture...I would have kept ir.  Wouldn't mind it if the manufacturer could try again mor like the picture.
3.0,"I‚Äôm still debating whether or not to keep this or return it. It looks great from a picture but it does have a few down falls. The top has no support, just a set of lone underwire that are oddly placed. The shorts are too tight at the top band and can create unsightly tummy bulging."
3.0,"I like the look of this watch but, unfortunately, I did not consider if it would fit my wrist correctly since it was a stretch band that should cover a range of wrist sizes.  The watch is too large and slips and rolls around my wrist but I like the look of it and do not want to bother sending it back since it is likely my own fault for not checking the stats for size.  However, total satisfaction with seller."
3.0,"the clasp broke after a few wears, it can still be worn but not cool for parts to be coming off."
3.0,"I got the rose gold tone, it started coming off and turning silver after two days of wearing (even took it out to shower). It also looks like its starting to turn black and tarnish in some areas already. The flexibility of the ring is convenient however for putting it on/taking off."
3.0,I like the feel and look of the leather ..but ..even after wearing it for a few weeks now ( including in the pool and shower). I is extremely difficult to undo the metal arm form the hole on the band..I even flattened the tip a bit using a pair of pliers ( after using them to pull strap back ) far enough so I could remove the watch ..I've never had a problem like this before with any leather watch band...and not that it's the fault of the design...but of course my wrist width just happens to fall between the pre-made holes...one hole too tight..the other too loose...
3.0,"This is well made and works, my only problem is it doesn't tighten small enough.  I bought it for bike riding and it isn't snug enough on me and slides all over.  Otherwise it is very nice."
3.0,"The material is terrible.  There is no way I would wear this dress out in public.  I am using it as a night gown only.  I thought it would be a knit rayon/span but it is not.  It is more slinky, flimsy and without any appreciable stretch.  The wrinkling factor is the deal breaker for me.  I don't like any material I have to baby.  And this would require too much work to iron out the creases which were much worse after washing.  Other than that, I wear a 14-16 and purchased this dress in L.  The fit is fine as well as the style. I really can't recommend this item."
3.0,"Material kinda thin, wanted to send back  didn't  feel like going through the trouble. Does fit somewhat  small."
3.0,sizes are not accurate
3.0,Fits normal. Low quality hat with thread coming apart. Cool image.
3.0,"Ordered the red and blue. Dresses fit but do run a bit small. Beware, the red looks more like burnt orange."
3.0,"The first one I had (1.5x) was pretty good. But I lost them at an event a couple of weeks after I got them. I ordered a replacement pair at 2x strength. Unusable. Way too much blur, too high on the glasses. I have to tilt my head down too much to see through the top of the glasses and see where I'm going. Just ordered my third pair, another 1.5x, and will HOPE that these are usable like the first pair. BTW the wire earpieces seem incredibly fragile and bendable. I don't have a lot of confidence that they will last long without bending or breaking."
3.0,"Sizes are not consistent.  Bought two pairs, one in black, the other brown.  Finger length on the black pair was almost 3/4&quot; longer than the much better fitting brown pair.  Both do work with iPhone."
3.0,"Loveddddd the design and quality. Unfortunately, I‚Äôll be returning it because the M top fit true to size but the skirt was too small. I‚Äôm an athletic build; I feel this outfit would fit true to size for someone with more narrow hips."
3.0,"The watch is actually darker than pictured. The double clasp is nice but it tends to come undone when I move my wrist certain ways. The date is also constantly a day behind, despite me resetting it every day."
3.0,it is a piece of cloth .  it thin ! it only positive is that it has smiley faces on it . that's why I brought it
3.0,"Too narrow! These boots are beautiful and I love the style‚Ä¶ BUT, they they are too narrow and they squeezed my toes so tight that they turned red and sore."
3.0,"These boots are very stylish, although the size is fit as expected on the sole, the mid-calf does not stretch that much and it is very tight on my calf. I think they should be made for a more universal fit because they fit for someone with very tiny, thin calves and my calves are a bit thicker. Overall, I do recommend for anyone with thin calves, but if you have larger calves I would not suggest these boots."
3.0,It‚Äôs a good suit and looks great but I had to resew every single seam connecting the black to the red because it was cheaply done
3.0,"Cute, but the adult small looks more like a youth size."
3.0,Shoe for just quick access.  Not for a lot of walking.
3.0,This outfit looked adorable in my opinion and the material was nice. Unfortunately the fit was laughable. My husband said the skirt looked like one of the turtleneck pieces old ladies wear under sweaters.
3.0,"Nice tube necklace, but the pearls were plastic and the package also contained little fuzzy ball things the size of the pearls that you could put in the cage as well...  ( kinda cheap)"
3.0,"Could be my device, but glove didn't offer true palm rejection till I purchase two more, and wore all three together, one inside the other. Other complications developed with tablet (unrelated), and eventually switched devices anyway."
3.0,"Little strings hanging off of every corner  or seeme, not very soft"
3.0,Very soft cotton but this is the largest XL shirt I have ever put on my body. It was comical.
3.0,The umbrella isn‚Äôt as sturdy and well made as I would have hoped. It‚Äôs not automatic so you have to manually open it which isn‚Äôt a bad thing but not my usual preference in a rush.
3.0,Love it lots of  complements
3.0,They are okay. A bit dull and itchy.
3.0,"I returned this suit. The bottoms fit fine, the top fit ok however I purchased this style to be able to be active in, such as paddleboarding or kayaking. It had almost no elastic at the bottom holding it down, so it would rise up if you lifted your arms. If they had added elastic to keep the top on it would be a very cute suit"
3.0,I bought the navy dress. To me it looks more black. The material is very soft and comfortable but the look of the dress is definitely not as cute and high quality as the one the model is wear in the picture.
3.0,Size fits fine but very thin will use for sleep wear only
3.0,Super cute but runs big
3.0,Not as good as other silicone tunnels I've gotten. They're VERY soft and have a hard time holding their shape without collapsing on themselves but my ears are also freshly stretched to an inch so that will definitely not help my cause. The colors are awesome and they're very comfortable to wear. I'm sure once my ears have settled and aren't so tight on these plugs it'll be better but for now they're falling just slightly short of what I was hoping for.
3.0,"The foot beds are comfortable and I wore them most of the day, which is uncommon for me since I normally wear flats. My issue is with the upper part, which hurts my toes. For the price I was really hoping to love them..."
3.0,My 21 month only wore them once and they started to rip and fall apart.  They were washed in the washer once and then really fell apart. Had to throw them out.
3.0,Ok if you don't plan on tucking it in.  Shrinks quite a bit in the length.  Plus the color is not a bight white when compared to other T-shirts.
3.0,Nice dress but it looks nothing like the picture and the material is cheap and transparent.
3.0,Thought the lenses would be bigger
3.0,I like it but it is more of a peach color than orange. The ring fits perfect and I have tiny hands.
3.0,Not true to size but it is a beautiful product. Had the size been accurate I would have kept it. Too bad.
3.0,"I usually have a head that hats don't fit well so after reading everything I went with I need this big hat.  However, it is too big even on me.  In addition, the strap to hold it on your head is just a shoestring and you can't put it through the hat in a way that it goes under your chin and stays out of the way under the brim.  Also, it doesn't have much space to vent so it is hot."
3.0,uncomfortable  and pinched.
3.0,Came with a spot that looks like it had been bleached.
3.0,Description is misleading...
3.0,Fit was fine for my 14w/16w frame but I felt I looked like I was in a sack.
3.0,"Far too small. I got size large, and they literally look like Barbie pants."
3.0,For this price it's ok. Washed once and the stitching came loose. My daughter wears 24months / 2t and it is too long on the straps for her.
3.0,the hook is too small to &#34;screw&#34; into my nose and i can't use it.<br />i think it was my fault when ordering. otherwise its pretty
3.0,Nice looking guitar strap. However! This guitar strap stinks way too much like shrimp for my liking. I can't handle that.
3.0,"If are a plus size this isn't a plus size sweater it fits but it doesn't  fit like the picture.  Love the feel, and shape looks good on but doesn't fit like picture it should be a size larger to obtain the slouch look"
3.0,This must be made for a very short person because the corset waist is right below my boobs.  Not on my waist.  I am 5‚Äô6‚Äô and normally wear a size 12 dress.  I got a 2x in this dress which fits except for the extremely high waist.  You would think they would proportionally address the waist.  Not worth sending back.
3.0,Looks nice on. I wear a size 6 ring and this was a little big. Also it is made very cheap. Not sure how much wear I will get before it falls apart.
3.0,"It's cute,  I sized up to xxl to be safe.  I'm 5'7, 185, 38d and curvy. Fits me perfect.  Only issue is I ordered black and clearly got the navy one and I wanted it for this weekend to wear on my birthday. Disappointed I wont get a new one in time."
3.0,"This watch comes in a branded box, but the box is not that great. It could work for gifting but it is somewhat lackluster. The watch is an interesting color of gold. It is a little bit darker than typical gold but still shiny. It catches the light well and looks good on wrist. The hands are decent and the lume is passable. The watch keeps time well though. However, I felt that the bracelet and clasp were a little flimsy."
3.0,Looks great but they make me sweat under eyes.....
3.0,It's cute but the fabric is extremely light and soooo see through.
3.0,Great for people who don't carry a lot in their wallet. Edge of wallet near corners at fold will rip down to stitching. After this happens. Wallet is fine.
3.0,Ok I got the first one was way to small. So I went up two sizes well they was suppose to send me a 1x they sent me a M/L. I can get on but still tight. It does feel good on but still upset they sent wrong size when I talk to someone and they told me they will send 1X. That‚Äôs a lot money to just throw away. I have been looking for one like my other and this has a good feeling to it.
3.0,"It looks nice , but very uncomfortable around my waste. My waste literally hurt after a while of wearing it. So I had to stop wearing it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it"
3.0,"This fabric is indeed stretchy, making it comfortable, on the flip side also making it semi-see-through. Really if i wanted to show the world everything then I would just leave the pants at home. Might not be as big of an issue with the darker colors, but the fact that it‚Äôs so thin makes me doubt they will be of any use whilst hiking."
3.0,"The design of the dress is fine and it fits nicely but I was not expecting it to feel and sound like sleeping bag or windbreaker material. The cloth is polyester but it's kind of stiff and plasticky, and very noisy. I really wanted to like it but it's too different from other milumia dresses I've bought that have been softer, stretchier, and quieter. It's also more transparent than I was expecting but it's not too bad."
3.0,"However, if UV protection is all that you want, these will do the job...."
3.0,"Should have went with a larger size, they are made to be snug"
3.0,The jacket fit but the sleeves were entirely too small. Were not X-Large sleeves
3.0,"The simulated diamond was very big and beautiful. However the skulls, which is what attracted me to it, were so small they were barely visable. Looks almost nothing like the picture."
3.0,Cheaper material but super cute dress. It fit well but was too short for a dress !
3.0,Cheap and comes in four different colors<br />Hoop is kinda thicker than i expected
3.0,"I had ordered the medium-sized of this product, when I got it appeared to be much smaller than I expected. It will still suit my needs. But the medium-sized is a lot smaller than the pictures make it appear."
3.0,Way too small and especially short. More like a Capri fit. Good price fast shipping.
3.0,"This pair is too tight. It left sock design marks on my legs. Next time I will try out less compression, 15-20 instead of 20-30."
3.0,"I ordered these for my wife that wears a women's size 9 shoe.  They are long enough and thick with padding in areas that rub.  However, they are a tighter fitting sock even for a woman."
3.0,"For the couple of dollars it costs, it actually isn't bad. However, the SM is definitely geared towards someone close to a  34B - the band was too big and the cup size far too small for my petite 30DD frame."
3.0,"Very cute suit, but cheaply made...what can ya do for $9.99??"
3.0,"Although beautiful, I was very disappointed in how tiny it is.  The photo led me to believe it would be bigger.  I still love it, it just doesn't show up as well as I thought it would."
3.0,"Although I love the way this cuff looks on my ear, it broke in half after just a couple times of use. It is very delicate which causes it to bend easily."
3.0,I do not think they were nitrile maybe food service gloves. would not order again
3.0,It's really thick and has a very strong odor.
3.0,Loved the watch for my husband. Hated the fact the band broke the second time he wore it. Was hoing to send it back for replacement but just purchased a new band for it at the local Walmart
3.0,"For the price, you can't expect too much, but half way decent would have been nice. The mask was permanently creased and kind of melted to itself in a few spots, the gloves fingers were all the same size and unable to actually go on a hand, and the green ""fur"" was more fuzz that shed like you wouldn't believe. It took a lot of cutting, sewing, and doing my own thing with it to make this work. In the end, it turned out decent, but I had to completely cut up the gloves and sew them into pieces on other thin gloves I already had, I cut the eyebrows and nose part of the mask and 2 way taped them to my face and put green face paint on, and hairsprayed the fur down a bit to try and keep as much as possible on the costume. If you don't have high expectations then it'll be OK."
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress and it fit very well in the bodice and skirt, but it was about six inches too long!  My granddaughter is in the 50th percentile for her age, so we were very surprised it was so long"
3.0,I always wear XXL in Castelli bib tights; new ones didn't fit well. Also designs in calf area left imprints on my calves. I returned product prior to using.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt last long won‚Äôt be buying again. I have small wrist and the elasticity didn‚Äôt last so it‚Äôs super loose on me had to order different ones
3.0,"First off I really like the shirt. The material wasn't what I expected cause I thought it was just like a regular T shirt but just with the design added but it's a spandex/ underarmour (if u play sports) kinda feel. I ordered a 'XXL', I'm 6'6, 205lb so it fit me like a medium :/. Still rocked it tho. Just ordered the red in 3XL"
3.0,"Zipper is not always smooth to operate, but for the price it will do fine."
3.0,I didn't like this dress so much on me but it is cute.
3.0,"Great idea but poorly made, it had multiple loose strings and looked a bit messy."
3.0,"Does the trick. I am a busty lady and I wear minimizer Bras, they are my go to because I hate all the padding in bras. Seriously? I don‚Äôt need any more emphasis on what I have. However minimizer have absolutely nothing to keep me from nipping out. So thus I must buy inserts. Nothing overly special about them. They don‚Äôt really help with lift or shape. Just keeps me modest  ."
3.0,"I love watches.  I collect them, I buy and sell them, and if I could wear more than one at a time without people pointing and snickering I probably would. I like the innovative style of this watch so I bought it on line and herein lies the caveat. A number of watch manufacturers over the past few years have started integrateing watch bands/bracelets as a design element.  Often that may be a good thing because it provides a finished and distinctive look to the watch, as it does with the Momodesign Jet.  Sometimes that may be a bad thing because no other band or bracelet can be used as a replacement. You buy the watch, you buy the band; it's a set package. Had I bought this watch at a brick and mortar retail outlet I would no doubt have tried the watch on and immediately noticed my problem, as I did when I opened the box and tried it on. The problem is with the butterfly clasp which opens and closes the band with the aid of push buttons that extend front and back of the band. Push the buttons and the catch is released and the band opens. Push the two halves of the clasp together and tiny hooks hold the clasp tightly until once again released. Unfortunately, the buttons that release the clasp extend too far outside the edges of the clasp and the pressure required to open the clasp is much too light. Every time I flex my wrist in a downward motion toward my arm the clasp opens, and I do mean every time. So here's the problem with an integrated watch band: if it doesn't work for you then you are in trouble. I've emailed the company twice over the holidays with no response. Okay, it's the holidays so maybe I'm expecting too much.  The closest dealer is well over a 1,000 miles from me and it has taken me a week of internet searches to find a replacement band...in Latvia of all places. Will I have the same problem?  Maybe.  But, this time I'll take it to a jeweler with the right tools rather than try to fix it myself. And the next time I buy a watch with an integrated band I'll think twice."
3.0,"At first glance, everything came as promised, on time and complete. I couldn't be happier with a great buy. However, my stretching journey has come to an abrupt stop due to a damaged stainless 8 gauge tunnel. The tunnel is jagged, with a rough unfinished polish, and broken razor sharp insertion head. Additionally, the 6 gauge tunnel has imperfections, the center of a tunnel appears unfinshed that stops abruptly after the flare."
3.0,Definitely order a smaller size! The shirt is cute but the material of the shorts is horrible! Very poor quality and see through. I only gave 3 stars because I do like the shirt.
3.0,"Ripped very quickly, i didnt like them for my 7 year old. They only lasted about 2 months before they were destoryed."
3.0,"Apparently it bends pretty easy though, my ex bent it on accident in just a few months. She is pretty clumsy though."
3.0,"for all intents and purposes based on the size chart i should have been able to wear an XL, but because i often get bamboozled by sizing, i went ahead and ordered the 2XL which starts at a weight and measurements that are beyond my own.  so i was pretty disappointed when it didn't fit - at all.  the fabric is pretty nice and feels good on the skin.  and the dress itself is a great, classic cut that easily could have been one of my favorites.  i'm going to keep it around for awhile, just in case i unexepectly shrink."
3.0,They are cool. The nose pieces rattle.
3.0,Size down- they super stretchy and big. I made the mistake to size up but honestly I could of sized down to M I got XL. I am usually a 12 in jeans /I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù 195lbs. I would recommend to go 1 size down
3.0,Cute girl bunny stake but smaller than expected
3.0,"Finally used it, the mid sized luggage wheels broke the first week overseas. We will see how the rest do on the next trip."
3.0,This was a great fit but it faded in the first washing
3.0,"I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could. I usually really love the dresses and clothes from this seller, but this dress has an un-flattering waist band that makes it look like I have some pudge that does not exist; the waist band actually should be tighter and higher up. I will still wear it and enjoy it. This seller has some really unique items that always get complimented."
3.0,"I had bought a hoodie size XL 2 months ago and it fit a little snugg, not too bad, still wore it. Im 5,6 190lbs.  Wanted another one and i ordered  a 1x thinking it would be bigger than the XL. It wasnt, it was so much smaller than the XL. It fit like a Med/Lg. I was so disappointed!  Definitely returning this item... Also, its so short, fit at the top of my pants, this should have fit waaay below that. Not buying again...."
3.0,"This is a gorgeous piece but it broke after I wore it once, I had to try to put it back together but it doesn't look the same as it did when I first bought i, still pretty nice."
3.0,"The vest I received, is not in the picture.  The vest I got doesnt have zipper pockets like the picture. And only 4 heated spots not five. 2 front pockets and 1 lower and 1 upper back heater."
3.0,Small than I'd like.  I ordered XL it fits like L.
3.0,"You get your money's worth. It'll help with organization, but no compression and I don't think it's water proof. Helps you pack smarter and more concise."
3.0,I thought these stones were small and pricey for the size.  For $1.58 per rock I felt they should be bigger. The photo shows two rocks on one gift card so you get size idea.
3.0,"I didn't realize that they weren't sterling silver when I ordered them, so that's on me.  However, the earrings are larger than I expected and on the heavy side.  I wanted them for every day use, but they are just too heavy.  I'll wear them, just not daily.  They are beautiful and well made though."
3.0,"Quality looked fine but the size was either ridiculously small or ridiculously unintelligible.  The size we ordered was 12Y-13Y for our 11 year old but I would say that it would have fit an average 8 year old.  Maybe 12Y-13Y doesn‚Äôt mean 12-13 year old but that‚Äôs what it looks like.  And the description had no translation of the size.  If you have an 8-year-old, then the size 12Y-13Y is a 5 star product.  Otherwise we were bummed it came nowhere close to fitting and we needed to go to a store to find something at the last minute for Halloween."
3.0,I loved the fit of this bathing suit! I purchased a small and for my figure it works great. The material is sort of cheap but nothing to really complain about. -Buyers daughter
3.0,"My 9 yr old son ordered these with his Christmas money. They work fine. My only concern is the tip is much harder than the actual Nerf brand darts. They HURT if you get hit with them, and can do some damage around the house."
3.0,"It's way smaller than it should be. Everything was popping out until I finally got it in the sweet spot.  Order many sizes up.  It's well made, but way too small."
3.0,"First off the sticker on the lens is there for protection, just take it off and the glasses work great.  I love the size and how light weight they are but I gave them a 3 star because of how easy the get scratched.  I have two sets of these and over half are so scratched I can't use them.  I am very careful with them but even setting them down on the lens side will leave a scratch."
3.0,"This looks nice and the sparkle certainly helps with its appearance. My wife is frustrated with how difficult it is to put on each time. It‚Äôs not impossible it‚Äôs just more time-consuming than she would like. She said it also irritates her skin after wearing it for a while. The material feels like it won‚Äôt hold up for very long. It was easy install to the I watch and it‚Äôs very cute once it‚Äôs on but because of the difficulty putting it on and the irritation, she doesn‚Äôt wear it much anymore. It‚Äôs an OK product at the right price but a $21 it did not live up to expectations."
3.0,"The smallest one was broken, but other than that their nice."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, I guess. Although this was super fun & cute for the bday girl to wear, by the end of the night some of the letters had fallen off. I guess it's more flimsy than you would expect."
3.0,"did not like metal band, wish it had a choice"
3.0,"Very soft and comfy; but oversize, very wrinkly, and the ""wine"" color looks more like a burnt orange to me.  The fabric is so stretchy, that you can easily ""err"" on the side of smaller.  It runs pretty large."
3.0,Was what I was looking for but even though I bought two sizes bigger then normal because a lot of people said it was too small it was still way too small for me.
3.0,"(this is my initial review) I love the way these look on.  Appear to be well made. My only criticism is that they are a little tight in the crotch. That being said, they make &#34;everything&#34; look great!!!<br />**UPDATE** 6/23/17<br />Since I liked this swimsuit so much, I ordered another in a different color. I just received it and I am LMAO!!!!! When I tried it on, it fit a little tighter than the first one, but when I went to tighten the drawstring, I found the size tag that is usually in the rear was in the front!  Thinking that I had put the suit on backwards, I took it off, turned it around, put it back on, and it was obvious that I had had it on correctly the first time. THE DRAWSTRING IS IN THE BACK!!!!  I couldn't stop laughing!!!! Oh, those Chinese!!  I thought about returning it,  but I figured it will be a great conversation starter at the beach!!!"
3.0,Not proportional to larger watches
3.0,Mine had purple in the earrings instead of the burnt orange stones. Bought it for the burnt orange in the earrings :(
3.0,I bought this to give for Christmas. Disappointed that the fabric is so thin. I do like the vibrant colors though
3.0,"I bought this to wear to wedding receptions, but I ended up only wearing it once. I am between an L and an XL, so I figured I would buy the XL just to be safe. The dress itself was really beautiful, especially the color and I got many compliments on it. However, I think the fit is really off. I managed to squeeze into the dress, but I was uncomfortable all night (it was the only dress I packed and I was four hours away from home). When I got home and took the dress off, I noticed the left dart on the bust was starting to tear, which was odd because the bust wasn't even the tightest part of the dress. Despite one of the darts coming apart, I definitely would've considered purchasing the dress again, but I can't justify it with the fit being so off target."
3.0,"Cute earring, lost the within 2 weeks. Fell out of my ear while I was out."
3.0,We were just too small I'm size 38 I figured XL would be the right size they were just a little small and that you have tags in them they're not tagless like it reads
3.0,Not the best material  Looks kind of cheap
3.0,top was too loosey goosey - felt like it is more for a junior to wear not a woman; returned it for this reason
3.0,"Honest review here ‚Äî this is not a horrible dress if you have a really nice small waist and very flat stomach.  Alas, that is NOT me at this time  (I like pizza too much).  The fabric of this dress is absolutely NOT forgiving. I am a 6 these days ‚Äî 34DD, and approx 28 inch waist, 37 inch hips.  I ordered a large based on sizing info and while it fit, it was all kinds of unflattering! If you‚Äôre above a 6/8 I don‚Äôt think this will be for you.  Large is the largest and it fits like a 6 or a small 8.  Even with Spanx it didn‚Äôt look great -  the fabric is really clingy (it‚Äôs is like a stretchy textured polyester).  Also, the ruffle at the bottom and the very long, thick straps also made it feel a little fussy and kind of dated.  When I put it on, it reminded me of a line in Steel Magnolias ‚Äúit looks like 2 pigs fightin‚Äô under a blanket‚Äù... that‚Äôs what I looked like in this dress! Lol. So, the moral of the story is, small waisted ladies, you might be ok ‚Äî for the rest of us, this may not be the right dress."
3.0,I am 5'9 size 12/14. I ordered an XL. It fits fine in the chest (Im DDD). But the dress is slightly too short. It hits right at my ankles. Its also see through. You can see the outline of my bra through the dress and I could see the outline of my underwear as well as the pattern of my underwear. I may exchange for a darker color (I ordered the light blue with orange chevron). I also don't really like the spandex material. It holds a lot of static. Im going to try it on with nude undergarments and see if it looks better before I chose to return.
3.0,"Arrived as stated on the order, unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to wear them they were to small. I ordered a size up but they were still way to small."
3.0,"First of all, my package came very fast which I was surprised. When I opened it there were no instructions on how to assemble. I had to figure it out but it fits ok. I would‚Äôve preferred one size fit all band. You have to remove some pieces to adjust the band to fit. It was not easy!"
3.0,I thought it came with the bra sewn in. Nope
3.0,Cute and soft material but this kind of fabric doesn‚Äôt wash well and I needed a slipper that can be machine washed.
3.0,Tight a bit but nice ...
3.0,"Pretty good,  could tear easily.  Warmer then expected. A little shinier then expected."
3.0,I wish it would support the breast... they comfy though
3.0,"These earings are beautiful, I thought the Pearl would be small they are way to big for my ear that it doesn't fit like they show in a sample picture."
3.0,"I've been using an S-Carabiner (#3) for years for my keys. It's been a great way to keep them attached to my pants loop or anything else with a hook. I saw this clip and thought maybe it was time to try out a new product with a bottle opener. Afterall, why carry two items (clip + bottle opener) when you can combine them? The less things rattling the better.<br /><br />The first mistake I made was not looking at the size closely enough. I've attached a picture to help scale this thing up a bit better for others that find this product. The actual key loop is the same size as a standard #3. But the other loop, is where you run into issues. It's too small and oddly shaped, making it pretty difficult to clip to a belt loop or anything wider than a quarter inch.<br /><br />It's a sturdy clip and I have no doubt it would last awhile. The bottle opener works just fine and it has no issues keeping keys on the clip. But it's simply the wrong size to be of use to me. I feel on the border of a 3 or 4 star rating, considering I have decided to abandon it after a few months of use I suppose 3 stars is adequate. Waste of money for me, hopefully whomever I pass it on to finds it more useful."
3.0,"I did really like the design and color of the dress. I will agree with other reviews it is somewhat see through and the fabric is thinner than I would have liked, but it was ok for the price."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt really fit and feel compression
3.0,Okay quality.
3.0,"I *loved* the cut and color of this dress pockets were also a wonderful addition.  Unfortunately, I found a snag when I wore it the fifth time.  Considering I was wearing this to work, it is no longer possible."
3.0,I didn‚Äôt like the way this looked with my white Garmin. The fit wasn‚Äôt snug enough for my wrist and it felt a little scratchy on my skin. I returned the watch band.
3.0,Frames are nice but I was looking  for the green like in the pic and you really can't tell
3.0,Runs a size to small and shrinks when you wash it
3.0,"Cute and colorful. It was surprisingly a little baggier than a typical S but it‚Äôs very comfortable and lightweight despite being a hoodie. The hem stitching looks perfect and, overall, it‚Äôs good quality. No pockets though. And it‚Äôs not particularly warm either. It‚Äôs intended for warm spring days or summer evenings.<br /><br />There was no label with care instructions attached but the product page indicates the material is a cotton blend which explains why it‚Äôs very lightweight and doesn‚Äôt have much of a thermal capability. Hand-wash, low or no iron."
3.0,Too heavy to hang for pierced ears. Heavy weight.
3.0,"The reviews made it seem great.  I feel like the edge irritates my face.  There is a very small amount of light leakage near my nose, but that is probably just my face.  I have only worn it one night, but I am hoping I will get used to it.  It was not uncomfortable and I definitely had no issues with eyes or eyelashes feel confined."
3.0,"The shirt's cut and style were nice, but the material is almost like a flexible plastic-y material (similar to how windbreakers can feel)"
3.0,Very cute. I‚Äôm tall so always knew I would wear tights under it.
3.0,"I sent this back after trying on. The quality of the material was nice. However, the trunk of the garment ran snug and the arms were ridiculously long."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt think it had pearls on it so it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted
3.0,"I looked like I belonged in outerspace.  If you want the cat eye look, they are very cat eye-ish. Ok"
3.0,Flaws and dimples in the metal‚Ä¶ not the same thickness throughout
3.0,I think that the seam to the shoulder strap will unravel rather quickly. also the seem going down the middle of the whole garment is distracting. its cute but not exactly what I thought it'd be.
3.0,A stage show
3.0,"I usually wear an extra small, so I ordered an extra small. Once on it fits me perfectly. However, as other reviewers have mentioned the product does tear when you're putting it on. My hip to waist ratio is 25 in waist and 32 inch hips and yet the product's stitching was tearing as I was attempting to get it passed my hips. I wish they had a way to fix that or have the product more heavy duty stitching."
3.0,My great grandson (5 years old) wanted boots to play in.  It works.
3.0,Weird shape on face
3.0,"I bought this for keeping the sun, bugs, etc out of my eyes while driving on moped.  They have held up over two months so far.  They are not particularly sturdy, and so I think, a little over-priced, but they will hold up for me, as I am not rough with them and store them in the accompanying case.  I DO like the case and protective bag that is included."
3.0,Bought an X-large. Shirt fits small for an X-large.<br />Fits Tight in the arms
3.0,"I loved this dress.  The material is great, I could wear the dress without a bra and not have issues needing pasties.  The problem is that when sitting the top bunches too much and fashion tape wasn't the solution for me, it just looked funny.  It might be because I'm pretty small chested, so just be aware of that when buying. I'm 5'4&#34;, 125 pounds, and an 34 A cup."
3.0,Sent back. Too small.
3.0,Had faded after 1 washibg
3.0,Thanks a lot.
3.0,The fabric is thin and see through
3.0,The earrings are as described. They are very lightweight. The color is boring but nothing a little paint can't fix.
3.0,"I am a 34DD and ordered a large. The top is a bit tight, but the bottoms are perfect. It does hold the girls in place though."
3.0,Cute. Ran super small.
3.0,"They are okay, smaller then what I expected, and thin.  However, they will make due for this winter.  I mainly use them to exercise, or wear over legging."
3.0,"Pretty floral design, but armholes are really small and fit across the bust is too tight on this size Medium.  I'm 5' 6"",  140, size Small to Medium, bust size 36 C.  Have to return the dress.  Will keep the black dress of similar design because it fits."
3.0,"The shell is pretty, but has many have noted the necklace is just a bunch of thick strings, poorly held together. We put it on a different necklace. The Shell part is a bit thicker and heavier than I expected from the pics. It is sturdy and can handle dropping, however."
3.0,"This bag is very stylish and not cheap looking love it , would definitely buy again. Arrives on time too."
3.0,I purchased an extra-large and they fit more like a size 12 expected it to fit more like a 13/14.
3.0,we ordered the 3xl b/c we were thinking lets get a size bigger.... well the top was to big and the skirt was way to small and the bow was off the sock.  So 3xl did not fit a 150 lbs person. so we had to return it. I think it would have been a great costume had the sizing been more even on top and bottom. I measured before placing order and it still didnt work out.
3.0,"We got this dress for my daughter's first birthday.  We will only use this dress once for the cake smash and that is probably it.  It feels a little cheap when we took it out of the package.  It is pretty thin and looks way better in the photo then in real life.  However, it works for the cake smash and for one time use."
3.0,Looks like the picture but is kind of an odd shape and short
3.0,for American size.. it is not fit . ( too smallll)
3.0,The top of this dress is beautiful. The bottom not so much. Same material as a table cloth & the waist is smaller than it should be. So runs a bit small. I would have given this 5 stars if the material of the bottom of the dress would have been made of anything else because the stiff table cloth like material is horrible
3.0,I received the wrong size. I ordered large and received medium. Other than that I like them.
3.0,"I like the beads and the quality of the string. But the hot pink/pink which is the color I want most bc it‚Äôs my favorite color, was bleeding onto my skin. They started turning white. The other colors are ok thus far. So I already put them on and they are tied so I could not return. Please fix the pink and stop the color from bleeding."
3.0,Fades quickly as washed
3.0,I ordered a plus size.  Disappointed at how small pants are.  They appear to be a small.  Other than that i like the material and design
3.0,its okey
3.0,infected my daughters ear the first time she wore these.
3.0,"I am a size medium in everything...however this is something I wish I would have sized up. It fits, its just snug"
3.0,"Cute, but not very much UV protection"
3.0,Top was really cute but runs really big
3.0,"The mask was lovely for a formal event. But when I wore it again, it was pretty stretched out.  Not strong enough to withstand repeated wear."
3.0,The brown is a different color brown then in the photo and completely different material!
3.0,The dial is a little busy. If the smaller dials were contrasting colors it would be much better. I wear tri-focal glasses and just could not see the smaller dials. I gifted it to my nephew and he likes it a lot.
3.0,"well made, cushy and comfortable except they were too tight on my toes attached to my 3E 11.5 foot. They were tight on my toes and I had to take them off after a 4 mile walk. But I think if you have a D width or less these would be good for you."
3.0,I really liked the look and feel of this shirt but it was differently to small.
3.0,I‚Äôm a size 27. (Size 4 or 5) the measurements say that a small is a 26.5 in so I went with a medium & they are huge. Like unwearable huge. Too long and too big everywhere. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 & 130lbs for reference.<br />I‚Äôm sending them back & reordering a small so hopefully the small will fit
3.0,"Love the color, not sure I like the rope holding the top of the shirt together."
3.0,Runs a bit large and pockets are cumbersome
3.0,Little on the tight side but everything was good
3.0,"Nice fit, good fabric"
3.0,This is a very short dress. Short enough to be a shirt.
3.0,"I bought 2 as  gift for 2 girls for their 12th birthday.  The initialed heart was much smaller than depicted and it was hard to tell what the initial was.  They kept them, but I was disappointed at how small they were.<br />I should have paid attention to the description instead of just looking at the picture.  Lesson learned!"
3.0,The pin was lose but nothing super glue couldnt fix !! Like the logo though thank you
3.0,"Very cute top for a toddler, but neck opening is very small without stretch to pull easily off and on."
3.0,too small and tore first time on
3.0,"It‚Äôs a cute shirt, but it does not fit like the picture. It‚Äôs more similar to a boat neck as it doesn‚Äôt really hang off the shoulder."
3.0,"I wrestled with 3 or 4 stars and it's really 3.5.  I rounded down because they really aren't what you'd expect, but they are what you paid for.  I bought these to replace another pair of &#34;thinsulate&#34; labeled gloves that I've had for a few years.  These gloves are knit outside like the previous gloves, but thinner in fabric thickness.  They aren't the best quality for durability either, but even though I didn't get what I expected, I did get what I wanted.  The thinness of the fabric means that I can put on my leather work gloves over them.  That's something I've been wanting to do with the old pair.  Now I can work outside in the cold and have warmth and the toughness of my work gloves too.."
3.0,A little smsll
3.0,"I loved the color, the fit was perfect, but the material is thin enough to see my underwear lines and cellulite, it needs to be a more durable fabric for working out. I also didn‚Äôt care for the sheen in this particular color (brown). These pants would be great for a long tunic and boots.... in the spring and summer."
3.0,"the opening in the sleeves at the bottom was to ""droopy."" made it look like the material had been stretched out."
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt like to stay stuck in place
3.0,"I liked it but it's definitely not one size. It looks wide and billowy but the seams are about 4&#34; in on each side so it's pretty narrow. I'm a size 14/16 and it's way too small. So, if you're a size 10 or smaller it might be okay. A bit thinner that it looks also. I'll be sending it back."
3.0,Products received was not what the picture shows
3.0,You can't see the writting and very tight on the Chin area very cute design but doesn't fit right
3.0,Hoping for the best!
3.0,"Nice, but smaller than desired. Child"
3.0,"Fit a little bit small, really short. Glad I was already planning on wearing with leggings."
3.0,Dots on bottom are too thick. It would be uncomfortable if you were on a hard surface.
3.0,"The material for the dress wasnt what I expected, a stretchy polyester. That being said, the dress is comfortable and fits well. I ordered a size up, but probably would have been just fine ordering my size too."
3.0,"The necklace is pretty but the hook that hold it in place turned black in 2 days, while the necklace is still gold. Also, the necklace pictured is not the one I received. Still a nice piece. I think I might buy a leather necklace to go with it instead"
3.0,I like that it has space...fits my thighs. Not as shapely as I had hoped. But it is appropriate for work. I wore it today.
3.0,This product is cute but the size is big. I guess I can wear the shoulders as a halter top. I should‚Äôve gotten the smaller size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 160lbs and I got a large because it said to get a size bigger. It‚Äôs a cut dress just a little big is all.
3.0,"Suitable, but felt a little 70s-ish. Nice silhouette and it gives me a break from my all-black, everyday professional wardrobe."
3.0,I love the color the material was good not to thick I don‚Äôt feel those pants really represents a size 2x  the stretch wasn‚Äôt really there could‚Äôve been more stretch in the jeans to give that perfect fit. I would suggest going up a size when purchased 2x is the biggest advertise for these jeans. I am definitely going to wear cone this fall. I would purchase again.
3.0,I like the shirt. Looks as pictured. Slightly see through and there is NO give in he fabric which makes taking it off slightly hard.
3.0,"The snap came lose as soon as I tried it on. Other than that, it's a good cover, I got it for nursing. You get what you paid for, don't expect quality. I'm normally an XS / S in American sizes, and the Large fit me OK in this one."
3.0,"If you‚Äôre between sizes, size up. The dress fit and was very flattering, but if I were bloated, this dress had no give/stretch. It zips up in the back and that‚Äôs all the space you have. It was a bit short as well."
3.0,Size is too small and I bought it on size bigger
3.0,"Laura Burch artful clothing, purses, etc are always saturated in color and design. I was rather sad to see that while the colors and art remain the same, the fabric is a much lesser quality. The results are a lack luster and course feeling."
3.0,"I loved the design, look and feel of this bra.  Unfortunately, it was too small.  Also, the zipper did not have a piece of fabric that flipped over the bottom end to keep it from rubbing your skin.  I returned it because it was too small, but probably would have kept it otherwise to have as an extra."
3.0,There ok. Not exactly a great deal but better than dollar store glasses
3.0,Really cute skirt and the embroidery is nice. The waist fits pretty high which makes it too short even for a mini skirt. I'm 5'8 and normally a 6 but ordered a large.  Runs small.
3.0,This is a nice looking band. It fits well and adjusts easily. My only complaint is that it slips when you're active. Sitting in an office all day it would probably be fine but it made me nervous loosening up while I was working out or doing chores.
3.0,They were pretty cute when they arrived but they are cut really small. Had to return them.
3.0,"It looks great,but the writing wears off to easy. Also was too big for my 13 yr old sons wrist. No sizing options. But for the price,the message came across to my son. He'll have it forever"
3.0,"Nice dress, but saving it until I lose 10 pounds."
3.0,The dress was way too long when it arrived-sat right at the knee. I had it hemmed 4 inches and now it‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs a cute style but expect to hem it.
3.0,These socks are really nice and thick but will not fit my foot.
3.0,"Frame scratched, a little too dark. Ok for very bright day."
3.0,"The top is thin, but it‚Äôs manageable"
3.0,More like lounge wear the feel is comfy soft material fits as expected.
3.0,"Great idea, make the waist bigger even tho elastic, I am 6'1&#34; 210."
3.0,Way too big and cheap looking. Deceptive photos.
3.0,"This is track pant is very light weight, and fits well as per  size chart. I ordered small size, it fitted well for my height, 5.7. The quality looks good from outside, but inner cloth is abit rough. Otherwise it is a good jogger pant.."
3.0,"Love the dress, but runs much too small!!!"
3.0,Very pretty but if ur sensitive to fake jewelry be careful you will get an allergic reaction.
3.0,The tank top was nice but it was a little tighter then I expected. Not a loose fitting tank.
3.0,"Uncomfortable to wear, due to the large rubber piece that your band is secured into. Lots of holes to adjust but nothing I found made it feel quite right. If the rubber piece was smaller for typing on a keyboard it would be more comfortable."
3.0,"5'8 145lbs usually a size 6-8.  Bought a med.  It's a little clingy though the mid section,  showed off my tummy pooch more than I would like.  Also, I'm a 36C and you cant wear a normal or halter bra.  I tried a strapless but because its clingy it showed the bra right through. Showed all the dimples and bumps on my rear, too.  Alright dress overall but would not buy again"
3.0,Why are pregnancy clothes so oversized? It does not help in the shopping process. These pants could have been so great. I even bought two pairs in different sizes to help with fit. They were both way too big and my thigh jiggled the fabric around in a way that made them unflattering. I wanted them to work so bad. In a pile of give aways.
3.0,"Nice coverage, UV protection without darkening too much. Unfortunately these do not fit the shape of my ears very well, and the arms push against them and hurt over time. My room mate loves them and uses them on every bike ride. Overall they have a rather cheap feeling, but seem to be holding up well."
3.0,order 2 sizes up if u are busty
3.0,Definitely did not think there was gonna be so many loose strings on the inside by the zipper piece. Thinner that i thought it would be also kinda of big for my face
3.0,"Wore them for my wedding and reception.  They were a little bit too big, I wear women's 8 wide normally.  They were soft and went with the style of my dress, so no one noticed that they were a little too long for my feet. :)"
3.0,"I bought these for a camping/hiking trip to Moab, UT. I ended up wearing all weekend as the other shorts that I ordered last minute ended up not fitting. When I first tried them on, I couldn‚Äôt believe how soft and comfy they were! Waistband was a little tight, but still wearable. The pockets are perfect for my phone or other items I want accessible during hikes. But these were just too good to be true. After 2 days of wear, the fabric started pilling in multiple places. Then after washing, threads started coming loose at the seams. I‚Äôll keep these for at home lounge or workout wear but wouldn‚Äôt order them again."
3.0,Nice Cap top quality
3.0,Not the right mint green for my purse an fits somewhat large
3.0,"This was a pretty top. I'm not too heavy at all so it fit my chest very well. I really liked the wrapping strings although, way too long, but in understand. Just becreative with how you tie the strings. The only issue I had was the shirt is extremely sheer. If you don't wear flesh toned pasties, you will be in terrible shape."
3.0,"Only got to use it once....the clasps started to change colour after the first use. Then again...for that price, I wouldn't expect anything else."
3.0,It looks so cool! But in some aspects I watched something in a duck places.
3.0,"I wore this to Disneyland and it was a huge help in carrying my wallet, and other small items. The zippers were cheap, and I was afraid they would break since I was opening and closing them often. I loved all the pockets and loved how it looked thought"
3.0,"I have fairly typical  womans medium size hands and found these gloves to have very long fingers. They fit the width of my hand properly, but there is almost an inch of fabric hanging off my finger tips. I used them under my gloves while skiing and my hands did stay warm in 15 degree weather."
3.0,"Thin material. Cute, but I didn‚Äôt like the high low design. I returned it."
3.0,Fit as expected. Is a cute shirt to wear. But will shrink a little in the wash so be careful.
3.0,Needs to stay wet. Dries quickly
3.0,"Cute but tiny on the chest area. If you're a flat-chested girl, go for it."
3.0,Can't like if they don't FIT!<br />SECOND PAIR I SENT BACK!!!!
3.0,Runs way too small in wa are
3.0,"It was very pretty but felt a little cheap. I expected it to be just a little bit bigger, but it was ok."
3.0,"Compared to other binders, this one was a very tight fit. Too tight and hurt me and I had previously measured my chest to make sure it would fit.<br />A little disappointed, but overall the material feels nice. It‚Äôs a big longer than expected so it rolls up at the bottom. I bought a Large and I‚Äôm a chubby dude, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to roll up that much."
3.0,"Wasn‚Äôt really soft, slim fit but arms are roomy and too long.  I wear a large and the body fit like a medium and arms were an XL"
3.0,These are super cute and made well. Just make sure you get the right size. I ended up getting  toddler 9 and not a little kid 9 amd it is basically going to fit my kid for a few months.
3.0,Is just a little too long that have to fold it down and up.
3.0,"Fits like a compression sock but I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />-Its a THICKER sock but it also holds up well to washing. Just not thin like described<br />-It is a seemless toe construction<br />-It goes on the calf, not over it. Which with the compression nature sometimes can be too constricting based on the size of your calves.<br />-The sock keeps it shape well over months of use<br />-Sock is more grey color than blue"
3.0,These are the bomb actually! I was very surprised only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is the lint the black ones attract...I got the XL!
3.0,"Did not fit well on head, but the material is easy to cut, so I cut it into a hat. Smells like rubber but that‚Äôs expected. Overall, it worked and it‚Äôs cute for costuming."
3.0,"I really love the Chicwe clothing line and have 6 articles of clothing from them. However, while the pants fit really well in the waist, they are too baggy in the leg and are tapered, which is not my style. I thought they'd be more fitted."
3.0,"I bought a size 14 first and it was molded larger than an average size 14 boot but very easy to get onto my foot at the ankle part of the boot. I then ordered a size 13 to see if it felt any better. Well first of all the boot had a different pattern on the rubber itself than the size 14 boot. Also it was very hard to get my foot into it because it was mold much, much, smaller at the ankle area. Although both boots are stamped with the tingley brand name, it seems as though they may have not come from the same factory due to the different mold pattern on the toe of the boot, and the different boot removal lug on the back of the heal."
3.0,"Avg quality, runs a little short...<br />The color is true to the photo"
3.0,The goggles are well made except for the clip which is problematic. It stopped working correctly the first day we tried them. The clip would pull apart. The rest of the goggles are nice. But it‚Äôs hard to use them if the clip isn‚Äôt working. I would love them if it wasn‚Äôt for the clip.
3.0,"it's a bit too long not has shown knee length , love the top but the bottom part had to get it adjusted."
3.0,Edges are very hard to get into the lace holes in my tennis shoes.  Colors are also not as bright as pictured.
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and I got a small and it showed at least three inches on my midriff with my highest waisted jeans.
3.0,It has a seam right down the middle and doesn‚Äôt look like it does in the picture
3.0,Cute but do not hold up well
3.0,The red ones were slightly larger
3.0,I need  help putting this on I don't want to break it is very pretty please help
3.0,"My son was really excited to wear this for Halloween. Tried it on through t house several times, but time for trick or treat an walking from house to house the holes to the eyes made it difficult for him to see. But other then that great mask more realistic then any others an made well!"
3.0,"I put on the bra which fit so comfortable and smooth texture but the side bulged out and made my outfit look weird. I had to return it, too bad I would have given it a 5 stars if it fit better around my 46DD breast."
3.0,It is a fine hat but is not worth $33. I hot mine th RV u someone else for $13 cheaper
3.0,"It was fine,but not exactly what I was looking for"
3.0,"I wanted to love this- the material is super soft, but I have a long torso and it just doesn‚Äôt cover, I‚Äôd be nervous to lift my arms up in this."
3.0,"They appear to be good to high quality, I'll let you know after I wash because if they shrink at all they'll be far too tight.  Happy I heeded the advice of several on here~if you wear a Medium, get the XL which is snug for those needing a Medium.  That's why I hope they don't shrink but being cotton they probably will.  I'll get back with you after I wash.<br />UPDATE: I've been washing and wearing these for two years and I was wrong, they didn't shrink and have held up beautifully in the wash.  Really like them. And for the price I love them."
3.0,I always wondered if all these heated products were a gimmick so I decided to give these Accsa heated gloves a try. Overall I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a must buy item but they do work okay once you get used to operating them. I see myself using these gloves as normal gloves more than for their heated function.<br />Pros:<br />The glove sizing was perfect for me<br />The gloves are comfortable and soft on the side<br />Each glove has a drawstring at the end to keep snow and wind out<br />The heating function keeps your fingers warm<br />There are 3 temperature settings and you can even set each glove to a different temperature<br />The gloves use batteries so you don‚Äôt have to worry about remembering to charge them<br />Cons:<br />The gloves didn‚Äôt come with any instruction so you‚Äôll have to go back to the product description or just do a trial and error on your own<br />Each glove is controlled independently of each other so you‚Äôll have to do everything twice<br />Heating doesn‚Äôt evenly distribute across the whole glove<br />You‚Äôll need 6 batteries at a time to use the gloves<br />Only 2 of the fingers on each glove are touch screen capable<br />The led light on the battery pack isn‚Äôt visible on the outside so you can‚Äôt easily tell if the power is on
3.0,"No son 32 cadenas como dice el anuncio, son 12 cadenas con 20 accesorios y eso te da las 32 piezas. La verdad es un enga√±o, pero de calidad son buenos."
3.0,Much shorter then the photo and I don't have a very big neck.
3.0,One pair had a tear at the seams
3.0,Frail
3.0,NOT TOP QUALITY BUT GOOD ENOUGH
3.0,Not easy to pu on.  Would like a picture to show how to put them on.
3.0,"I didn't get the sized they stated for me to get on chart.I went up a size and I'm a 22 it was still kind of small and I believe I got a 3x, I tried it for a day it had my posture right, but I could not take the way it push against my stomach it was to tight, I should of order a size up 1 more and return the other but I'm so ashamed of how big I've gotten I just let it go:( .. I know next time!"
3.0,Good fit. Don't love the fabric.
3.0,These were cool looking but they chip off after a week.
3.0,"I ordered this dress in two patterns and really dislike the fabric. It's a thick poly blend that does not breathe at all. Also snags easily. That being said, they were cheap and are a flattering fit. They also have great, roomy, front pockets. Maybe after I wash them a couple more times, they will soften up and make good house dresses :/"
3.0,"Super comfy, the sleeves thread near the wrist rips easy."
3.0,"It's beautiful...but hard to size. I wear a 14 (XL), so I ordered XXL and it's still a bit snug around the chest area."
3.0,These run small. Order a size or 2 up. They‚Äôre super cute though.
3.0,Smaller than I expected and has fallen off a couple of times.
3.0,"It is a beautiful bag. Very sparkly and very catchy in the spotlight but it is poorly made. The purse doesn't actually close, the top flap folds into the gold bar which comes off.  Several items slipped out which caused a panic so I would suggest you watch your items or pay close attention to the bag itself."
3.0,No stretch torn in the stitches to quick
3.0,Colors are off.. I chose this headband because I liked the beige color in the ears to offset the darkness of the rest of the band and antlers. But there is barely a discernable difference in color from all of the browns of the whole headband so thats a little disappointing. Probably need to update the stock photo.
3.0,This has a seam in the back that wasnt shown in the pics and is a big mismatched pattern. Also runs small.
3.0,I got this skirt in pink and the color was ok but the material was a little too shiny for me. The flow of the skirt itself is beautiful. I'm 5'1 size16 pants and i got the 90cm length and it was a little tight but not uncomfortably tight. That length went past my ankles but didn't drag the floor. I ultimately returned it because i didn't like the shiny aspect of it.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. These are okay; however, they don't really stay on my glasses and they are shorter than they should be. Not my favorite products."
3.0,The mask itself is great. You can feel it's fragility but it's clearly if you miss handle it.<br />It is way too small for a face like mine. If you have have more feminine or slim face it'll fit great. I had to super tighten the mask bands so it would stay but now it's just not comfortable.
3.0,"Can't wear them over jeans, only over tights, as they are just not big enough.  *sigh* but they're cute nonetheless."
3.0,I wish the lining was warmer...but looks good on.
3.0,"It honestly should be less expensive. It's not great quality. Really cheaply made. However, I do like it. I love the style and length. I just wish I were made with better material to make a better product. Or at least the price lowered. It really isn't worth $9 plus tax."
3.0,"Looked good at first, color quickly faded after washes. The fabric began to fall apart after 9 months of excessive use."
3.0,"Wore the red one for a day and it was already chipping, so don't expect the color coat to stay on long."
3.0,Definitely does not look like the picture. It‚Äôs a stiff large square cut shirt that does not compliment any body style.
3.0,"it didn't fit me well, wasn't flattering to my figure"
3.0,"If you buy this in pink/peach you will need a dress slip, you can see the color of your underwear. The length is nice and the fit is comfortable. However the dress had a smell that was strong like some horrible chemical."
3.0,"It‚Äôs okay . There‚Äôs a bit too much fabric on the boob area , so it sticks out near the armpits . I just tucked it a bit but later it unfolds . I would recommend taping it down to your body . Soooooo yeah ."
3.0,"Like the suit however, the cups move all over and give NO SUPPORT"
3.0,I got these for my son who wears a size 10. They fit on the small size and the heel kept slipping off inside his shoe while walking.
3.0,"It is a lot thinner than I expected.  It was my fault.  The description clearly states 1.5 mm.  I was not paying attention.  I think my original was 2 mm.  The shaft do not have a seam like my previous (not OEM) .  This one claimed to be stainless steel.  My previous one rusted out, weakened at the seam.  This no seam stainless steel shaft should be stronger than my previous.  Fits OK, holds OK.  Noticed a few had stuck plungers.  One fell out.  Difficult to put back in the shaft.  Had to put it on a vice to press it back in.  OEM pins are usually better quality.  Feels ""sturdier"".  These feels flimsy ... BUT, they work, for now."
3.0,Fits a little weird on smaller heads
3.0,The Shipping time was great but the shirt did not fit to the specifications
3.0,They are little tight at the toe and the seams are busting on the sides but they are still comfortable
3.0,Ahh
3.0,The blouse is a little awkward and the material felt kind of cheap. Still was very cute and the color was exactly what I was looking for.
3.0,"Just received the bathing suit today, good quality product. Seems well made, a little disappointed with the sizing though. The top is a 5-6 (what I ordered) but the bottoms are huge, fits my 11 year old niece. So now I have to go find a bottom that will work ‚òπÔ∏è. Also I found a name brand 3 piece bathing suit and rash guard at BJs for $10. üò´"
3.0,It's very poor quality material.vwould not use it.
3.0,"The white is a little off white and thinner then I wanted, but is  still nice."
3.0,should have adjustable band
3.0,"El modelo me encant√≥ ,pero la tela no."
3.0,You need to size up 1/2 size
3.0,I ordered size us small and received a large. It was way too big. The material its made from is nice.
3.0,"I find it very hard to locate larger sizes that are not briefs and FOTL is the only brand that seems to make a low rise brief above a certain size.  The issue with these is that the top band doesn't really exist.  While this make is more comfortable for larger women since it doesn't dig in at the waist, it makes it more difficult for it to stay in place. This means I spent a lot of time pulling up my underwear the first time I wore it, and not because I may have ordered the wrong size.  However , I believe if I wear with tighter waited pants (instead of the dress I initially wore the 1st time I tried these) they won't be as bad."
3.0,"I bought this for my husband.  It seems to work well, except that his watch band has 2 &#34;extra&#34; links (beyond standard size), and so the watch won't fit well inside this winder.  We contacted the company, and they said this winder is not expandable.  That leaves the watch clunking around inside the winder - neither a great wind nor a quiet appliance.  We are looking for a different winder to replace this one."
3.0,"Runs very small.  I ordered another style from this brand and it fit as expected, so I think it's just this particular style that runs small."
3.0,Looks a little cheap but then again didn‚Äôt pay much for it so it‚Äôs expected. Did get complements so can‚Äôt say
3.0,"A little large and boxy. More of a nylon? Material than cotton. Overall, ok. On the thicker side,, Warm.  Colors true to picture."
3.0,"Nice, but a bit small; I always buy the same size - just a bit to tight at the arms."
3.0,Rose gold tarnished! Not too happy about that! Silver is nice though!
3.0,It fell apart pretty quick
3.0,Super cute but I moved my ankle a certain way and broke :/
3.0,Very nice light jacket. Not bulky at all. Maybe on the thin side but very comfortable to pack and carry. Warm enough for mild weather. I wear small or medium. Ordered medium since reviews run more on the small side opinion. It fits perfect. A little bit tight on hips but maybe thats just me. It si not short either. Hits lower than below waist. Nice jacket overall. I got navy blue and it is really nice
3.0,Love the hat but shipping it in a bag is not a good idea it was crushed and misshapen
3.0,I bought this as a gift for a friend. I did want the white apron but I received the black one for some reason. Still giving it to my friend thought because I don't have time to return it.
3.0,Good quality.  I usually love Beroy‚Äôs cycle stuff- however across the lower abdomen was too oddly small which made the crotch be too low.  I may have gotten a weird pair or something though. I am an athletic build but not fluffy so I‚Äôm not sure what the problem was.
3.0,Too small maybe
3.0,"I bought the largest size they carry which was XL in white. It is pure white. It fits snugly on my size 16, 190lbs body. I wish they had XXL. The fabric is very light so I debated on whether to return it or not, but decided to keep it and I'll probably sew a long maxi skirt over it and transform it :-) . It's a cute dress but just not for me based on not being the right size for me and being thin. Will post a pic when I do transform it, IF it comes out ok :-)"
3.0,nice but the legs are too big around
3.0,"My daughter reported that there is still a slight gap at the top of her window, when these are installed.  She didn't dare put them in on a rainy day, which is rather counter-productive, considering the GA weather in December.  Maybe she'll get more use out of 'em next year!"
3.0,"Cute hat!  But the material has much to be desired, it is neither soft or breathable.  But if you are not wearing it for an extended time it is ok."
3.0,"Okay. Didn't love it, quality wise, didn't help that I had also ordered two other scarves that turned out to be soooo much nicer, showing up this one as cheaper quality for same price unfortunately"
3.0,Handles are not long enough to put on ur shoulder
3.0,Very stiff bag. Lots of loose threads. Very clunky. Cute but uncomfortable to carry around for longer periods of time.
3.0,It is like pictured. It doesn't have a way to close it. Have not figured out how to fix that yet?
3.0,We will see how they.wirk in the bright sunlight.  They work good so far
3.0,Not a great fabric. A bit heavy.  Love the print.
3.0,The skirt is a cute style however the color was very dingy and faded looking. I expected it to be as vibrant as the pic.
3.0,"I like it for the most part, i just wish it didnt slip off so much. There are silicon things at the back of it and it helps sometimes."
3.0,A little hard to tie but comfortable altogether material is made very nicely sticking is great should have gotten a bigger size
3.0,"This was for my 9 year old daughter. (She is big for her age (tall), usually wears a large or XL in Jrs. I bought a 2X and it BARELY fit. But she loved it while it fit."
3.0,"Super cute and not cut too low or too high on top. Length is a little short for work but perfect for a classy night out. However, I am 5‚Äô-10‚Äù tall and the waist is cut for an average height person so it looks like I‚Äôm borrowing a shorter friend‚Äôs clothing."
3.0,"Very cute, but  unfortunately it's the wrong size"
3.0,They came in early which is awesome! But the lenses already had a few scratches and were bent
3.0,This dress is huge. I ordered a large an it is more like a XXL. Sad because the color an material are great
3.0,The skirt was very cute but it was closer to an eight than a fourteen.
3.0,Hard to open but if you don't have a lot of stuff it is perfect.  Very pretty for special occassion ... Looks expensive
3.0,The directions read that it is not ok to use it on 24 carat gold  which i would have preferred to have been spelled out before i purchased.
3.0,Bought this for my just turned 3 year old. We bought the 3t and it fits really tight! I would size up.
3.0,"The mask is really cute and fits well, however the thin string elastic straps and both the straps are thru the same adjuster, it is difficult to get adjusted properly to keep the mask in place properly.  I never did get it to work properly.  The adjuster would not hold the elastic.<br />If you are handy and could rework the straps perhaps adding another adjuster this would be a really nice mask."
3.0,"I dont even wear it everyday it already broke, the chains in the back snapedand stone fell and warped the silver part and came out. Can I please get a replacement?ü•∫üò≠üôè"
3.0,"I wish there was a photo of just how big this thing is. The chain is also very long and the pendant itself is larger than a silver dollar.<br /><br />I bought this for my 12 year old for Christmas and while she likes it, I assumed it was much smaller than it really was. Disappointing."
3.0,"Normally I would order a medium or large. I went with medium because of the reviews, this thing was still huge on me! It fits ok around the bust, but the bottom is like wearing a mumu. I'm 5'4"" 150-ish my measurements are 39-33-42. It's comfortable and has pockets so I would maybe wear it around the house or something,  but it looks kind of ridiculous.  Would definitely be cute if it fit and seems to be well made"
3.0,"I returned the shirt because the pink was a little ""dusty"" in coloring. Also was not thrilled with the fabric since summer is coming. The quality was acceptable."
3.0,Only 3 stars because I loved it but it was too small and had to send it back. I got the largest size but it wasn't big enough for me (size 16-18).
3.0,This is a wonderful purse but the strap was not secured adequately.  I was able to glue the tab of the strap in place again.  Problem as I see it is that I only used the purse for one day before the strap came loose.
3.0,"I liked these but the physical ""diamond"" or ""rhinestone"" are kind of big. They look a little tacky"
3.0,"This sweatshirt came and it what too small for the size I ordered. Didn‚Äôt bother returning, too much trouble."
3.0,I wear a size 16-18 normally and it isnt a s flow as  the picture and it completely see through. I was hoping for an easy going dress to throw on real quick but this is going to have to something worn with it. The colors are just as vibrant as pictured and I do like the dress I'm mostly disappointed that I need to wear another dress under it. It is very long and pretty but expect to have to wear something under it<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest review.
3.0,"These are by no means tunic length. Might be an inch or two longer than a normal sweatshirt, but only comes down midway over my butt cheeks. For the price I can get simple sweatshirts elsewhere. If you‚Äôre looking for a true tunic length top look elsewhere"
3.0,"I bought matching sets for my 2 boys - 1 in blue, and 1 in grey to wear with their Easter outfits.  The grey suspenders broke - did't even last through Sunday School.  That's when I posted my original rating & review. Then I was contacted by the manufacturer, & offered a refund or replacement. I chose a replacement. However, we had moved since receiving the original shipment. Even though I gave them the new address ahead of time, they shipped the replacement to my old address, & it got returned to them. So, after all was said & done, I got a refund. The ties are adorable. The blue suspenders were worn by my younger son for 1 day, & they were fine. However, I still don't have matching grey suspenders for my older son."
3.0,It was OK but not the quality that I thought it would be. The top snap will not stay closed.
3.0,Colors presented add advertised.  Size was too small.
3.0,"Great looking looking glasses. They help when driving against the sun by cutting so much of the glare. Only problem i had, was that after a few weeks one of the arms broke off. I new of this possibility from other review so was very careful with them but they still broke. I did repair them using glue and they held up for another month or so before breaking again. In the end i feel like i got enough use out of them to not feel bad about the money i payed."
3.0,"Light is too weak - can't read the time in the dark.<br />Watch looks nice but small. Light, comfortable to wear."
3.0,Not bad but not great either. Does not have that much compression.
3.0,"Sizing is way off, runs about 3 sizes too small in my estimation. I'm not a stranger to compensating for asian and european sizing but this was ridiculously off. I didn't even attempt to zip it up since my flesh was sticking out of the zippered section like a busted sausage casing. The material was also see through, you need a slip underneath. Had it fit I could've made it work but I wish it's sheerness was made very apparent.  I purchased the gold version for reference. I thought it would have made an awesome piece for a costume at a good price."
3.0,"not one size fits all, good for adults, not kids. but sewed it to make it work"
3.0,I'm a 10 so I ordered the XL and it fit like a small! Seriously bad fitting. very disappointed.
3.0,Nice dress. Fits well. Quality a little below what I expected but good for the price.
3.0,There's no cushioning in these socks. They're pretty thin for what they are. I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"wish the lens were bigger, sides and top to bottom, 5 stars then."
3.0,The shirt was nice.. sharp print ..<br />The only thing was the women‚Äôs large size was small..I hope it doesn‚Äôt shrink when I wash it..( definitely it won‚Äôt go in the dryer)
3.0,Sizes are smaller than usual
3.0,I am mostly satisfied however the arm straps dig into my skin causing them to be sore after wearing for awhile.
3.0,Cheap feeling and looking but you get what you pay for. I'm honestly just using it for the backers at this point
3.0,Not too crazy about these socks. They don‚Äôt wash well. Lots of pilling and they look old and used now.
3.0,Leggings lose elasticity quickly and don't stay in place.
3.0,"I wore this shirt to work one day, below is a list of pros and cons from my 9 hour sleeveless chiffon blouse experience:<br />Since I don't like to go bare arms at work, I popped a little cardigan over this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The shirt arrived nicely packaged in clear plastic to prevent water or dirt intrusion<br />- I ordered the nude colored top, and the color matches that shown on the screen<br />- The top fits exactly as I needed. I'm between a size 6 and 8, so the medium fit just right to be a little loose and flowy<br />- The length is great, not too low, not too short. I'm 5'9&#34; and was comfortable with the front and back length. I would say the back length coverd about half of my backside<br />(I attached work bathroom selfies of me wearing the shirt to give you an idea of the fit and length on me)<br />- After one washing and hang dry, the seams were still holding together<br /><br />Cons:<br />- This top is VERY sheer. You will need a tank top with it. Even with a strappy tank, my bra straps were still visible, which is why I put on the cardigan<br />- Although it survived one delicate cycle, I'm not sure it will live for very long. The material and seams seem quite delicate.<br /><br />This is a cute top at a good price for everyday wear, but I don't view this as a high quality item that will have a long life in my closet."
3.0,"The chain kept snapping where it was hooked, but my arm was small enough to latch on another spot. This was the first time wearing it too. The design looks really cool and I got a a lot of compliments!"
3.0,Shorts fit and are cut. You can use scarf/top as a head band.
3.0,"Son loves it, but it runs smaller than I expected. I should have ordered up a size."
3.0,About the size of a nickel
3.0,They were too small. They did not cover my glasses.
3.0,"The fabric and hang on this dress is fantastic. Such a great feel and a great drop on the dress. Pockets are super nice as well. Alas ... it runs on the small side, I think. I ordered an XL but it fits much more like a L for me. Especially tight through the chest. Order a size up and you'll be happy."
3.0,"One of these was great and fit well. The other however, did not. I tried turning it upside down in case it was user error, but it def was more of a child's size."
3.0,Cute but didn't fit. Too big
3.0,"This fit incredibly tight on the face, so much so it was unwearable."
3.0,Top is smaller than we were expecting.
3.0,Very thin.. good purchase for less than 20 dollars
3.0,Now these are Asian sizes I wear  Med. but had to order XXL so just take not of that The shirt is made of thin material I like it I guess it is ok would I order again probably not
3.0,Very little stretch. Had to send back.
3.0,I like the size and i wanted  this color. It seems to be of good quality.  I was disappointed though because the water bottle holder is really small and very hard to put a bottle in. I wish it was a slightly bigger holder. i really purchased this bag because i was looking for a pink bag of that size and with bootle holder.
3.0,Nice semi quality not cushy ok just
3.0,"I really love this bra. I'm a 36D and the XL fit me well and provided enough support. After 5 months of wear, this bra unfortunately came apart at the seams :(  I'm going to look for a sturdier alternative, but if I'm desperate and out of luck, I would consider purchasing a new one."
3.0,"But my daughter fit it so I gave it to her, very lovely"
3.0,"Very warm, comfy , but too small in size, I wear medium and ordered xxl but still small. I need to to go up one size which they don't have."
3.0,this is way too small.. I can't actually get it on my head. I do have a large head I guess.. but that's still silly.. I will have to cut a larger slit in the back to actually wear it or re-gift it.. disappointed
3.0,Dress look nice but was too tight and just too long
3.0,"I was a little disappointed in the quality of the gold bracelet, it is very light weight and the cameo charm is very small. It looked larger and of a higher quality in the picture. I believe it is overpriced for the quality."
3.0,A 2X fit small
3.0,"It's quite a bit long at the bottom. This comes from a 5'7"" person"
3.0,"The lenses are large and fairly dark.  The problem is that they aren't designed for large men.  My young son and wife said they fit their face fine.  The glasses themselves are narrow, not broad enough for big guys (unless you like a pinching feeling at the temple)."
3.0,"Cute but cheap, they get the job done."
3.0,Really had high hopes! The name tag is stitched in but it‚Äôs completely upside down.
3.0,I loved the way the dress fit. Super comfy and length was great.
3.0,cute but ran small
3.0,So cute in the picture.  Looks great until you put a thick girl in it.
3.0,"I loved this necklace and got compliments on it often, however it broke after just a handful of wears."
3.0,"Gave this to my boyfriend's daughter for Valentines Day, she liked it but it is way too big even for me to wear. We were both bummed out. She said that she would keep it until she's older and can wear it."
3.0,I wear an lx i ordered xl they are the size of a small. They stretch but not all too well. Thats a major downfall.
3.0,Cute dress. Weird unexpected fabric. I would have loved this dress if it was just a normal cotton fabric but it's kind of swishy not quite silky. I dont know... it's not what I expected it to be. I wouldnt buy it again.
3.0,Item material is fine. The hat fits a little larger than expected.
3.0,Way too big I have to fold it up halfway above my face or head so I can see it looks ridiculous
3.0,"Fit small, cheap material."
3.0,My daughter loves this shirt. It‚Äôs a crop style. The medium shirt fits well but the medium shorts are small. She can wear them but only as sleep shorts.
3.0,"This mask is so cute but it doesn't fit my face. The ear loops are too far back making it fall down in front anytime I wear it.<br />I do own several other mask in this style and I don't usually have an issue with the sizing. This is made for someone with a larger or wide face.<br />I plan on just cutting and moving the ear loops because I love the print.<br />These types of mask are good for outdoor activities and keeping bugs and allergens out of your mouth/nose.  I use them while hiking and kayaking.<br />Because these are only 1 layer and have tons of tiny holes in them, they DO NOT make good mask for virus protection."
3.0,Very pretty but won't stay put on my ear lobes
3.0,"Very light weight material. Fit is a little loose, in a good way.  I like the fit.  Somewhat water repellent.  Love the pockets. Love the wide belt loops. Seem to be durable.  I have only used them for riding my bicycle.........I know, not riding shorts.  They are loose enough and breathe well enough for being active.  I bought them for outdoor use........biking hiking camping etc.  The jury is still out.  Will submit an update later."
3.0,"Very pretty dress but had to get it tailored. The shoulders were loose even after having them tailored for length and had the shoulders taken in. I‚Äôm 5ft 4in and 145 lbs. The other bridesmaids had the same issue with the shoulders and length. Flattering dress, though"
3.0,"Pro is the cheap price, con is the cheap quality.  Bought 2 packs of 40 and 9 were broken in the 1st pack, 8 were broken in the 2nd pack.  By broken, I mean that to varying degrees these did not work correctly.  Some would not turn on at all, some turned on if you tapped them a little bit, some would only stay on if you squeeze them, yet others were very dim.<br /><br />Good enough for giving away to 6 - 8 year olds for birthday party favors, but for something so simple, would think they could be made to work more reliably."
3.0,Pockets were not in the right place. Up to high. This dress was very tight in the bust area for a large. Loved the pattern of the dress and the colors. I was disappointed because I loved the look of the dress just did not fit at all.
3.0,"It was the expected length and size, but the material looked like cheap felt."
3.0,It‚Äôs a little big and hard to work out in.
3.0,"Cute, a little bigger than expected, however the lines were sewn at crooked where the seam meets the pink top part.  So had to return."
3.0,Lovely coat just disappointed in sizing.
3.0,"I expected them to be a shade lighter, but they're cute, light weight."
3.0,"Good fit good design and good price, but after a month and a half (and I don't even wear it all the time) the hem of the pants is ripping apart"
3.0,Too big. Maybe I'm too small
3.0,Cute necklace but the heart stays flipped upside down most of the time.
3.0,"The bracelet is really cute and closes easily. However, the snap charm was hard 2 place in the opening and it broke in half when I put the bracelet on. It shouldn't be too difficult shoe repair by replacing the O-rings on the broken side."
3.0,Believe the other reviews when they say the elastic on the the pants is very tight. I normally wear a small but ordered a medium for that reason alone and they are uncomfortably tight
3.0,"I'm a 36b top and 39&#34; hip, I ordered the large. The top was too big, which I was expecting, but the bottoms were too small. Returned."
3.0,Very cheap and over priced. But fits as expected
3.0,The charm is dull
3.0,the charm is not made very nicely... one side of the heart is bigger than the other side not making it look like it should even go together
3.0,"Nice piece, but most of the necklace was not black.  Still an attractive piece, though!"
3.0,A good product but the material was a bit stiff and scratchy for me even after washing it
3.0,This runs 2 sizes too small. Good thing it will fit my 10 yr old daughter.
3.0,"Super cute but a day after I have put all together, the chain came apart and my house key fell on the ground.  Luckily I noticed it by sound right away."
3.0,Fits good and love the style
3.0,More pajamas than fitness apparel.
3.0,Cute but super short in the front.  I'll probably have to wear shorts.
3.0,It had authentic Harry Potter label and embroidery but it did not come in original package.<br />It was meh because the material was thin. I couldn‚Äôt wear it due to size.<br /><br />Runs a little small
3.0,I returned this item because runs tight in the chest. I'm a 42DD ordered a Xl. Was not a fan of material does not stretch.
3.0,"I purchased a medium, and the fit was pretty good as far as the waist and hips. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 140, size 6. There was really no way to know the inseam, although the size chart gave an obviously erroneous inseam measurement of 37.4. But there were many comments about them being too long, so I thought they might be long enough. They‚Äôre not - the inseam is 27.5‚Äù. Also, I intentionally chose the army green ones because, unlike all the others, the fabric content listed was 55% cotton, 45% polyester. They aren‚Äôt. They are, like all the rest, a nylon rayon blend."
3.0,"Luckily I read previous reviews before ordering because this suit does run extremely small. I'm 5'8 120 pounds and I'm usually a medium in bottoms and a small in tops, I decided to order an Xtra Large in this suit and I'm glad I did! The XL fits perfect (I've never fit XL in my whole life). The only problem was that it doesn't have the &#34;thong&#34; bikini butt like it shows in the picture, which was my main reason for ordering this :( my advise, if you don't mind different bottoms than the picture and order a couple sizes bigger than what you'll normally wear, you'll like this bikini!"
3.0,I usually wear Medium and I ordered a Large and it wouldn‚Äôt even fit my thigh! So you might need to go up 2-3 sizes.
3.0,"Purchased this for Halloween for my ten year old. After taking a picture,  he changed into a different mask because he couldn't see out of this one."
3.0,"I ordered an XL and am 5'4 170lbs. It's not too snug but definitely could be a lot looser. When washing, I hang dry for fear it might shrink even more in the dryer.<br /><br />Update: I accidentally put it in the dryer and now it no longer fits........it shrunk 3 sizes. I had to buy a new one:-("
3.0,"Had always wanted to try one of these as it seemed streamlined, organized than a bunch of keys on rings poking through the pocket.<br /><br />Initially I put all keys next to one another without the washers. That kept it more compact without the need for spacers. But then things did not work out well with the car key as it had a thick rubberized top. That car key really had a lot of friction to rotate it out, and back in when done. Was annoying, started carrying it with the care key sticking out.<br />Then the second time of arranging these keys I left the car key out, and used the included washers. The washers make a difference, although try to find thinner ones of you can to cut down on the size between the sides.<br /><br />Had flared out the key-holed ends so I could put a split ring around them, and snaps to hold onto the belt keeper. That worked out well when having to rotate a key out for use.<br /><br />Burt then one evening, headed to work, the weight and rotation of this keeper turned the ignition off. Panicked, but got it turned back around. There was no mention about not putting car keys inside this key keeper. Should of known better. Now the car key has a fob on it, along with a snap to secure back onto this key keeper, and a snap on the other end to snap onto the belt. Also have a small utility knife I had on there but may relocate that, unless I go back to split rings again.<br /><br />This keeper still gets caught between the emergency brake (car) and on arms of office chairs. And while it does keep keys in line it takes some time to get used to. Just do not have your car key inside the keeper - too dangerous sticking out the ignition, and I had mine angled out and my knee hit it a few times. Not the best thing for compact cars with limited mobility.<br />However it does help me to keep the recumbent trike lock keys wrangled up and contained, and the other locks I used outside. For that this works out very well. Also is easier to tuck into vest pockets, bicycle packs, work packs, and such.<br />But... it is not the perfect setup. If the rest of the parts were aluminum the key chain organizer would be lighter in weight. The added stainless steel parts add far more weight than using split rings. And... once you get your key placement finalized, put some thread locker in ALL of the threaded parts as they will work themselves loose from use. You may have to add extra washers to make of the difference in key width.<br /><br />One thing I did not like was the base screw did not have a squared out area where in went into the sides. If it was squared on the end it would of made it easier to tighten down the screws. Instead, the pin end spins.<br /><br />Good for utility keys, NOT for car keys."
3.0,I wanted to like this but with the way the neckline laid and the material it was super itchy. Too annoying so I had to return.
3.0,It is a nice dainty necklace. My only dislikes are that it hangs shorter than expected and that the color of the necklace started to turn after a few weeks.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt love this looked nothing like pic. And was really small
3.0,"Cute, but a little large."
3.0,"It's tight around the boob area, and the bottom is weirdly stiff and creased, although I'm hoping that hangs or steams out. It's a stretchy material, and comfortable, and otherwise very cute, so I'm not sure if I'll return it or not."
3.0,I love the look but much too heavy for my taste. Returned.
3.0,When the product arrived it was very tarnished. I had to scrub each earring to remove it. Otherwise good product.
3.0,The size was too small. I usually wear a large or XL. This was a XL & it was too small. The sleeves are way too short & cheap material. I would‚Äôve sent it back but too much trouble. I‚Äôll probably not order any clothes on Amazon again.
3.0,"Warm and soft with a good fit. However, in less than a month they started sporting holes so not happy with their durability."
3.0,Nice jacket a little tight and it arrived with a broken zipper
3.0,"The pattern of the scrub cap is adorable, but the cap itself is really shallow and doesn‚Äôt fit my head very well. I can‚Äôt tuck my hair into it well either because of how shallow it is (and I have pretty short hair)."
3.0,We returned this item  as it did not work under the dress we were purchasing it for.
3.0,I brought these earrings and one is broken and the piece you put in your ear was bent and hard to put in. They arrived a few hrs ago.
3.0,"This bracelet looks pretty much like the picture (as you can see in the photo I've attached) but the beads seem smaller. Also, I have a medium sized wrist and this is shown as if on a much smaller one so it does't look quite the same. It has a clasp but it also stays on my wrist without using it, so I've just been wearing it that way. I wore it to work today and it has stayed on without any problem. It does sort of move around a bit but that's to be expected from any bracelet, I think.<br /><br />It's pretty but not exactly what I expected. I'd have given it 4 stores if the beads were larger, so that they looked more like the original picture."
3.0,"Ordered two in different colors, am sending them back as they are too small."
3.0,"They are okay.<br />I mostly used these to cover my arms when I would scratch them until they bled, causing people to think I some kind of disease.<br />Now they just ask me if I am cold and in the middle of June, it's funny"
3.0,"Bought these for my online teaching classes. They are okay, but they fit strangely and are hard to situate on your head."
3.0,Cheap fabric and felt clingy.
3.0,Feels like it‚Äôs going to slip off my head and ear coverings are a little large
3.0,The material is not as expected or look in the picture don‚Äôt try it yet the look of it is disappointing and the straps look like bra when in it I might give a bother review if feel better about it
3.0,The screw come undone easy
3.0,The shirt did not fit
3.0,Only worked for a couple weeks
3.0,"The bottom part of the pants is fine, the legs are wide and they are capri length. The elasticated top however is tiny, and while it does stretch this was definitely not an XL size (I sized up one size for more space too!).<br />I thought these pants would be super flattering, but they really are only made for people with no belly and no hips.<br />They are lightweight and lovely for summer though, just really not flattering if you have any kind of curves."
3.0,"I got these warmers because looking all baggy over a boot was the only sort of visual I could find that it would fit comfortably over my now chubby legs.  Unfortunately, it didn't occur to me that they might be being displayed over a cardboard cutout of boots instead of the real thing.  This wee bit of misrepresentation is my only complaint.<br /><br />They arrived on time, they appear to be a nice quality and my skinny-legged kid enjoys them fine.  Fact is, this is a long dead 80s fashion that I imagine only 3rd world countries will now be catching up to and will appreciate looking cool in. I was sad to see that fashion go since it was a rare one with a purpose beyond 'hey look at me'.  I got them because this is a damn cold winter and I shovel my own snow.  Maybe I can use them for arm warmers, that's a thing."
3.0,"i gave it a 3 because it is a very nice looking earring but i am unhappy because i bought it for my tragus piercing and its HUGE and looks ridiculous. so if you are going to get this don't buy it for your tragus, maybe buy two and just use it for regular earring holes."
3.0,Doesn't really look like the picture the picture looks like it has more detail than the mask itself I received also to dreadlocks where dismembered from the mask and the ends of the dreadlocks or bubbly and wrinkled as if they were incomplete
3.0,"You get what you pay for, but they work for me. They do lose their sparkle."
3.0,"I absolutely love the hat, BUT it is not adjustable and it was too big for my husband.  It was very disappointing that we had to return it."
3.0,The print on the bikini bottom is brown and NOT black like it looks like on the picture shown. Other than that it's ok...I do think I'll return for a suit that colors match
3.0,I love that it came with so many options but I should have known better with the cheap metal. My nose would itch after wearing.
3.0,"The wallet is slim, compact and fits easily in a small clutch. It‚Äôs too large for the pockets on my pants. I‚Äôm not sure if the RFID blocking works though because my work badge still works when I put it in the wallet and tap the card reader. Also, I don‚Äôt know if it protects all the cards, even the ones on the outside, or just the ones on the inside. This item isn‚Äôt accompanied by a description or explanation of how the wallet blocks RFID.<br /><br /> I put a few coins in the coin pocket, and the wallet would no longer snap. It will snap if the coins are in a single layer. You can put a couple of bills on the inside part. There isn‚Äôt a pocket for bills, just fold them and place inside and fasten the snap."
3.0,Roughs up and loses it color easily. Holds everything right and not too snug of a fit for cards. No section for loose change.
3.0,"The slipper lost it's support with two weeks.  I've had Ugg's in the past and I thought I would give these a try.  In the long run, I should of spend the extra money and got a pair of slippers that last for years."
3.0,I like the ring but the little beads on the top make it a bit uncomfortable to wear. I'll probably just wear it now and then.
3.0,"I returned these. I was aware that they would be cheaply made because they were cheaply priced and children grow fast, but they were way too small in comparison to other shoes."
3.0,Very comfortable and fit well but the hem is coming out after a couple wears.
3.0,"These are adorable. The fit was perfect too. However they gave my child bumps. He has eczema and allergies, that's why the need for 100%cotton. We practically charted days we were using these and can confirm this is what is causing the bumps. Disappointed because they r very cute and wash well"
3.0,were not water proof
3.0,it fits but it isnt long enough in the torso so if you have any boobage the waist will fall right under them
3.0,"The bows are beautiful and material is so soft. My bows didn‚Äôt looked frayed or homemade. My issue is that they are HUGE, I could literally fit two of my 1 month olds head in it. I don‚Äôt understand how people‚Äôs newborns are wearing them and they don‚Äôt just fall around their necks. Also, my girl has a big head"
3.0,Does not look like photo. Very blue which makes it look fake
3.0,There are not enough pockets for me.  I usually need to carry my phone and keys and there just doesn't seem to be enough space otherwise they are great.
3.0,"I ordered this dress last minute for a wedding that was moved due to covid.The seller was fantastic, they made sure it got to me by Sept 1 (when I asked...ordered August 1) and even hot here earlier than expected.<br />The dress was great minus the sequence under my arms was extremely scratchy and scratched my underarms pretty good. Maybe tape would have helped? It was a little big in the chest and straps but would be easily altered  or pinned (straps). The back was beautiful and the bottom was super flowy!<br /><br />Worst part was the under arm scratching!!!  Best part was length, and back, on top of speedy delivery!"
3.0,I love the way these gloves look but they are way too big. I wish they came in a smaller size.
3.0,Love the shirt but it did not come with the belt/tie pictured
3.0,Bought for my son fits just barely over his nose and mouth...he has to keep adjusting. He likes batman so I didn't return them
3.0,"cute shirt and fabric, runs very big!!"
3.0,"Real cute vintage, great quality and fit. The floppy hat I also purchased was shown on Amazon with the glasses and I really liked both together. However; I am not sure if I will keep since I am still trying to reshape the hat which was folded over several times in shipping. Disappointed with my purchase!"
3.0,lovely print....fabric ok. Fit is strange.  It‚Äôs too big in bust and too small at waist. Disappointed that it didn‚Äôt fit because I really liked it.
3.0,"This belt works as I expected and (except for the heavy buckle, which can be a danger to delicate parts when you are putting on your pants) I'm satisfied with the belt. It isn't anything very remarkable, really, at most it's clever. What's wrong is with this company and their hyper aggressive marketing emails that started immediately after I ordered the belt and have continued for months, no matter how often I've clicked on the unsubscribe links and even a &#34;chat&#34; with a company rep on their Web site.<br /><br />I decided that irritated me enough to write this review and now I've set up my spam filters to trash messages from them before they even appear in my in-box."
3.0,Beautiful dress but runs way too large. Ordered for my 9 month old but she will not be able to fit this until she is atleast 2years old.
3.0,Rating this a 3 because Im not that impressed with the fit of it and the ties. It‚Äôs good and will serve its purpose It‚Äôs seems a tad small for me but will work.  the thought of ordering an XL seemed excessive. I‚Äôm a little let down by the quality of the ties.... it seems for the price they would use a higher quality material. The strings will definitely absorb water which is a bummer because the hood is at least weather resistant. I‚Äôm wearing this hood with my north face jacket so maybe that‚Äôs why the quality of the strings stuck out to me.
3.0,They're cute. Came well packaged.
3.0,I ordered my daughter this jacket and it runs way small. I don't honk I would buy it again.
3.0,Runs small. Button broke off immediately as I put it on. Looks somewhat like the picture. Not near as loose
3.0,"Directions say to launder before use. They neglect to tell you there a sticker in the fold of the product and to remove it before laundering. So now there's a melted sticker, rendering the product useless. Also, it's a bit long. The fabric is more of a spandex type material, not cloth if that's what you're looking for."
3.0,"Colors were not as pictured, cheap fabric."
3.0,I would have liked instructions. I still don't know what the curved dealie is supposed to do.
3.0,It‚Äôs pretty cheap made for the price but it‚Äôs not the worst
3.0,Little disappointed as it didn‚Äôt have the bar for the nose that at this price is normally there. If your buying for warmth this is a summer mask with was fine as we live in a hot area.
3.0,This was not what I expected. It was very pretty but the pin did not open well. It did not stay on my hair well.<br />The color is just as you see which was nice.
3.0,The shoes looked great but not very comfortable if you are standing all day at work. It gets heavy with time.
3.0,"They're beautiful, but... there's a problem, when they arrived two of them had another color, an ugly color. So disappointed."
3.0,"Bought this for my 6 year old son to wear to a Hawaiian theme party. He is very slim and the 6 shirt barely buttoned, so we left it open.  The shorts are so see through they are not usable. It served its purpose for us - as a one time use costume."
3.0,"I thought this shirt was cream with black plaid online, but it's white with black plaid.  Soft fabric, but this is not a lightweight shirt.  It's ideal for use in the autumn.  Also, the pattern was not lined up correctly in the front where the buttons meet.  I'm wearing it under a jumper dress to camouflage the uneven closure pattern."
3.0,Fit as expected but is stretching out very quickly
3.0,"It's a decent hood.....I think for the price I was expecting more.  The quality just wasn't what I was expecting, I think I would have liked it more if there were some LED lights on the spikes.  It's not horrible, it's just not as good as other hoods I have."
3.0,"It wasn't what I was expecting but it's ok.  I thought it was a nightshirt but it's a nightgown. I am 5'4&#34; and it hits below the knees.  I weigh 130 lbs and it fits just loose enough around the waist, for someone larger it will be too tight. There are tie straps on the waist that are not shown in the picture. I cut them off as I don't see what the point is for these and it looks nicer on me without them.  I don't think I'll ever sleep in it, it's more of a button down shirt cotton than a nightshirt cotton.  It is very soft though.  I was expecting more of a turquoise for the main color but it's royal blue plus there is a lot more yellow than what the picture shows. I will be wearing this as a house dress not a nightshirt."
3.0,I didn't know the sleeves are sweater like material.  So not for super cold days.  I could have gotten the next size up.  Decided to keep it and match it with my cape.
3.0,Should have come with instructions
3.0,This is not my daughter's favorite leotard. I think it runs a bit small. When she stretches in class it cuts into her legs and the front dips a bit low. She always wears a bra top under her leos and with the front of this one it is a must. We love Natalie leos but this material is a bit still too.
3.0,"They're kind of flimsy & loose but we only bought them to go shopping.  With the coronavirus, no one wants to touch gas pumps or shopping carts so these are fine for that."
3.0,"Lots of shedding, for people with allergies. But, very warm. When I first wore it, I sneezed a lot. I‚Äôm going to try to wash it and see what happens."
3.0,"Gave these to my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. They fit really well and look great on her. The only downside is the zipper refuses to stay up. She fought it all day through school. I suggested returning them, but she likes them so much she didn‚Äôt want to."
3.0,"Looks great, but the size adjustment tool broke after removing 2 segments so it's still one segment too big. It was also incredibly hard to push the pins out. I don't see how most people would even be able to adjust it. If that wasn't enough, it broke completely wI think the first week."
3.0,I wear the tigers eye one everyday! The black and silver one tho is like a cheap plastic that‚Äôs painted silver.
3.0,"They were ok, you get what you pay for if its cheap they will work cheap but its a temporary toy but it was ok"
3.0,"I decided to be generous with the sizing when ordering this vest, incase I wanted to pair it with a hoodie in colder weather. So I ordered a 2X.<br />That wasn't big enough even without the hoodie underneath.<br />This vest runs small.<br />That disappoints me because I liked the vest and need a winter garment along those lines."
3.0,Its good and does everything it says but the app for the mask sucks balls. Everytime I connect literally 5 seconds later it disconnects from the mask. Its very annoying. But the mask is overall good
3.0,Its pretty and modestly comfortable but not at all adjustable so doesn't fit quite right
3.0,"You get what you pay for-very inexpensive looking.  The card was awesome, but not worth all the money."
3.0,A gift as it was too small
3.0,The sweater is cute and it's very thick. It is comfy and long enough to work well with leggings. However the sleeves are not anywhere near as long as the photos indicated they would be. They are in fact barely average long sleeve length and come to just below my wrist when tugged down as much as possible. This is despite the fact that the Shoulders are dropped so that where the sleeve attaches is at about the point where a short sleeve would end meaning that they had those extra several inches and the sleeve still managed to barely be of normal length. The dropped shoulder actually amplifies the shortness of the sleeve because as a result it is not proportionate at all. I think the picture I uploaded of the sweater on a hanger shows this pretty well. I've made sure to include photos of it on in order to illustrate the sleeve length issue. Also worth noting is that the sleeves are kinda wide despite not being very long so it adds odd bulk as well as further exaggerating the shortness.<br />Another small detail I feel I should mention is that there are black lines around the outer edge of the collar and around the upper sleeve where it connects to the dropped shoulder that are clearly shown in the photos on the item they are advertising for sale.  These details were missing on the item I received. Maybe not a big thing but it illustrates inconsistencies between the itemthey are advertising and what they send to customers.<br />I still like the sweater and won't be returning it but I am disappointed in the sleeves.
3.0,"Received my ring today, the sizing on it is super small. I wear a 8 on my ring finger. That's what I ordered and it barely fits my pinky finger. Very pretty ring though.."
3.0,Pretty believable set. Lots of cute ones and lots of questionable ones. For the price you can't be mad. After owning these for a few months the jewelry has oxidized a lot and changed colors.
3.0,"The material is slightly transparent and of lesser quality than I expected. I believe they are 100% polyester (?), which if known, I wouldn't have purchased. The product is good for at-home lounging and cleaning up around the house/yard- but I would not wear these pants out to the gym."
3.0,"The shoes feel ok as far as the material goes but I ordered a size 8 and received a pair that say ""S"" on the tag. They are probably a size 9 and a bit too large. I can make do but I was hoping for a correct fit"
3.0,"These are nice boxers; however they are called compression, and they do nothing in the way of actual compression.  They have pretty colors, and the boxers are for guys with hips that measure the same as their waists, so they aren't for the guys who like a shorter waisted product.  The spandex really shows what you have and hides what you don't have, so they are not &#34;enhancing&#34; in any real way either.  They feel like almost nothing on since they are so thing and roll up against pants legs or roll down against a belly.  Slight adjustments will make future versions better suited to &#34;everyman&#34; tastes."
3.0,This dress is super cute and soft but the knot in the front feels weird like your underwear is going to show lol.
3.0,It's pretty hard to secure in your wrist. It's like a plastic leathery strap. I'm not that impressed but at least it's waterproof.
3.0,Appears to be more peasant style in the picture. Its still a very nice/ sexy blouse.
3.0,It's ok no the greatest leather but it will do for now.
3.0,They are polarized and do reduce glare. Difficult to put on one handed. Scratches easily. Not worth the  $10 I paid. Cheaply made.
3.0,The top fits perfectly but the bottom was small and the material keeps riding down.
3.0,"I bought this because I liked the cloud print. But It was a bit snug & brim could have been a little longer for sun protection. Basically,  I  kept it because I  really liked the cloud pattern. If I  had known how it would fit prior to purchase, probably wouldn't have got it."
3.0,"I ordered an XXL after reading other reviews, but I wasn't prepared for how small the shirt actually is. I would say the XXL is closer to a Large than an XL. The fabric and stitch quality is good and the print on the is solid without any breaks. Too bad I can't really wear it."
3.0,Beware ... The bottom of this shirt has an elastic seam !
3.0,"Looks like pjs though, so I only wore it to sleep in, but soft and comfortable"
3.0,Absolutely the cutest shoes especially with skinny jeans! If these came in every color I would totally buy all.<br /><br />Review update 5 months later: only wore the shoes about 5-10 times max and I take very good care of my shoes and clothes. Put them on this morning and noticed a hole when I bent my foot. Cheaply made...
3.0,"Nice glasses, but not too sturdy!"
3.0,They worked alright for the money.
3.0,"As of this review this sweatsuit outfit costs right at $40.00.  After seeing it I would never want to pay that much for it.  I might go $25.00 but that's pushing it.  It looks a lot better on the product page than it does in the hand.  The material is thin, the top is cropped and looks like it's wrong side out with the way the seams are sewn.  The sweatpants are better sewn and don't look as cheap.  I received a medium size and there's no way I can wear it.  I'm 5'9"" tall, 142 lbs and have birthing hips.  I couldn't get the pants over my hips.  My skinny teen says she'll wear it but the way she said it makes me think it won't get worn and it will eventually hit the give away bag.  The tie-dye colors are pretty and well done.  I washed it with dark colors and it came out of the dryer sort of soft but I don't know if it shrank any or not.  The colors were still bright."
3.0,Pretty cute for the price.  I'm a size 2 and got a small.  Fit as expected.
3.0,"I misunderstood the picture shown and did not realize that we could not purchase matching earring for right ear.<br />As the earring has a clip (due to heaviness) as well as post, I know have two left earrings.  Also, when I put the<br />earring on the left ear, it look larger and clumsier than I expected."
3.0,Cute top but obvious made in China. Runs very small
3.0,"Love this outfit - i gave it a 3 though because of the fabric and also lost buttons. Fabric is rather on the cheap side but ok. Buttons were all off but one when i received the item, i will have to stop by Joan fabrics to pick up some buttons to sew them on. I'm 5'3&#34;, 162lbs 37 bust, 28 waist and 43hips. I bought this in a Medium and it fits perfect. Only things i'll have to do is sew the buttons on and hem this since it's a bit too long even with my 4.5inch heel."
3.0,"I used this on an international flight. Of course my bag was chosen to open. Instead of putting the strap on correctly, they bowtied it to the handle, and it came loose. It caused bad problems on the luggage carousel at the claim. If the TSA personnel do not know how to use this, and they do this, please know it can cause damage to the conveyors if it becomes caught. Great concept, great peace of mind, but unless you are confident in your TSA personnel, not great overall."
3.0,"I got it broke, after gluing it back it is oh so gorgeous. It was bought for my daughter for a pageant and she love it."
3.0,"..but not great. I got these without having ever seen them.  Unfortunately I got leopard print, and that right off the bat took off a bunch of points for them. Not a fan of leopard print for personal reasons. Anyways, aside from that they weren‚Äôt bad looking shoes so I gave them a shot anyway. They definitely run a bit small. I normally wear about a 7 1/2 and I went with 8 on these and even the 8 was just a tad snug, but not to snug to not wear. My feet are about average width and the fit fine width wise. These definitely wouldn‚Äôt work if you have wider feet. These weren‚Äôt overly comfortable but also not terribly uncomfortable. They‚Äôre fine for a quick trip to the grocery store or something where you‚Äôre not on your feet long but they don‚Äôt have any cushioning so I can‚Äôt see these working well for serious walking/working out/ etc. The overall quality of the shoe seems to be pretty nice and they seem well made and sturdy so if you‚Äôre looking for just a basic canvas shoe for short term wearing here and there these aren‚Äôt bad. I probably won‚Äôt wear them often though."
3.0,If you want some genie pants get these instead. Extremely baggy on the hip/crotch area. I'm a size 34 and these are a XL meant for size 32-34. I'm not going a size smaller to possibly get (HOPEFULLY A SMALLER) FIT. Good chances of it fitting extremely tight on the waist area. These XL fit my waist very snugged. So definitely not going any smaller. Nice stretchy material..... BUT DEFINITELY NOT A SLIM FIT...... Btw this picture is with the zippers closed. When it's opened it sticks out an extra 1 from each side.
3.0,"This was purchased very late in the season of 2019 when our previous umbrella came apart. We used it only a very short time in 2019 before putting it away for the winter. We got it back out and I can truly say 2020 is it's year......sort of okay, parts of it are off, and I only expect it to last just so long. It was easy enough to assemble and to raise and lower the canopy. Anything more than a gentle breeze threatens to send it twisting off the deck, despite the concrete paving blocks and planter boxes we have weighing it down. It has already thrown the blocks and twisted the metal base in wind that barely moved the flags in the neighborhood. I am prepared to start shopping for it's replacement because I know it's not going to last much more than another summer, if that. But it was fairly reasonably priced, and was available when we needed one. Next time, I'm going to do better research."
3.0,"The sparkles came off after one wash and dry. I realized I shouldn't have dried it, but I have others where the sparkles stay on even in the dryer."
3.0,"Made the mistake or not buying the Ultras. These are far far less comfortable, and fit way too snug (my ballpark is too squeezed for my liking). It's well worth the $2-3 more per pair to get the Ultras ($28 per pair, or cheaper if you want a weird/color)."
3.0,Fairly true to size. The color was spot on.
3.0,"I absolutely loved the first pair that I purchased. It was the ankle length black. So much so, I purchased 3 more in different colors. None were like the black. The black material is nicer, softer, slightly thick but not too thick. They stay on! No slipping down. No camel toe, tummy control on point & is simply very flattering. The black pair was perfect.<br /><br />BUT the others were NOTHING like it. They were too too thin, not soft at all. Not flattering. They slip down. Simply not flattering and very annoying. I was so sad.  The material should be the same with every pair purchased. It's not right."
3.0,These fit weird on my kids feet. I'm not sure he'd be able to walk in them.
3.0,I bought it for my bf. it is a little big for a medium! Maybe it'll shrink after a few washes and be the perfect size? But it's okay.. Just a regular sweater!
3.0,Casually Cute. True to size. Vivid pop of color. Only complaint would be material does look a bit cheap and is slightly scratchy -- but honestly that's to be expected for the price.
3.0,It‚Äôs a little bit bigger than I had thought it would be espically in the arms
3.0,I was going to return these because they were so big on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and about 140 currently. They were much too big in the waist. Then I washed and dried them and I plan to keep them now. They are super comfortable and look fabulous on. I love the flower pattern as well. There is still one problem with this pair (I bought 4 different prints) and that is that they smell like a metal of sorts. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it otherwise. It was so bad before I washed them that I couldn‚Äôt even be in the room with them. After washing once it‚Äôs still there. It literally smells like metal. Thank goodness the other pairs don‚Äôt smell like this and hopefully this goes away with the next wash.
3.0,Small band that holds excess srtap breaks easily
3.0,purchased 2 sets of 40.  Good price.  about 25% of the units would not light up.  Gave out the good ones for Halloween treats.  Kids enjoyed getting them.
3.0,The print is adorable-the size is not standard to a regular size chart.
3.0,Is kind of short  I was expecting it to be longer like the photo. It seats under my waist
3.0,Dropped 2 stars in your rating because I specifically purchased this as a gift for my daughter and was sold on the advertised unique Rose/drawer gift box that I expected to receive. The Gift box was very much a part of the giving experience! Very disappointed!
3.0,"The material was very nice and I loved the look of the bra. Unfortunately, the material bulged on both sides regardless of how the straps were adjusted."
3.0,"I loved the look of these frames on me, and my girlfriend. We both picked up a pair and had corrective lens placed in them. Lots of space, they work great for blended bifocals.<br /><br />My only, and main, gripe is that when my face accumulates moister either with extra skin oil or sweat, they have a terrible tendency to slide off my face. It's frustrating since even the slightest moisture can do this. So, they start to slip down my bridge or, when I look down, they just dangle before catching them just before they fall off my face to the ground.<br /><br />In other words, if you lead an active lifestyle, there's a real possibility these won't stay true to your face. Other than that, I think they look good, are plenty large for corrective lenses, but slip unreasonably too much for me to even consider a second pair. They can also be a bit irritating around the top of the ears."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" and this is more like a Tunic, it's a polyester material , with a bit of a silky feel. Cute but for shorter women."
3.0,"Nice collection, the cufflinks and button covers are the best part, and the tie and cumberbund are fine. The shirt had a lot of stray threads that I had to carefully trim off to make it presentable."
3.0,was thinner than I expected
3.0,I bought this for my best friend se was so happy it made her cry I thought it was a little pricey but I can't complain it was worth it with how happy it made her
3.0,Size is running small.
3.0,Pattern and colors are very pretty.Material is nice too.  For women like me with a longer torso the top is a little short due to where the waistband sits. For that reason it was a little to small in the bust size for me. Will return for a larger size.
3.0,Nice but gets very dirty quickly
3.0,"Beautiful dress for a different body type- tall, thin, no boobs. Great color and arrived quick."
3.0,"Runs ok but the sleeves are very long as it shows in the picture. But the dress is very short I cannot wear it as a dress I must wear leggings under it. Oh one more thing is that the white one is truly white, pure white. ."
3.0,They are smaller than I was expecting.  But they are nice and I like them.
3.0,It turned pretty easy but overall okay
3.0,"Nice Cardigan, but a bit small for me. I would recommend that you buy a size larger."
3.0,"The material is nice, the graphics are nice.  But the cut of this shirt is not flattering or comfortable.  It's short and wide...I bought a medium for crying out loud."
3.0,are expensive
3.0,"The zeger Lende Men Trench Coat Winter Long Jacket Double Breasted Overcoat, is very economically priced for a trench coat, but remember--you get what you pay for. From a distance, the coat drapes nicely, but up-close, the flaws are clear to see. The material is a cheap, micro-pore fabric that is highly flammable. The inner lining is a cheap polyester, that's not even fitted properly to the shell. And for a winter jacket, it offers very little warmth. But it looks good. I've been saving this for a Cosplay outfit for a future Comic-Con. All-in-all, I'd have to say this was my worst purchase ever on Amazon.com"
3.0,"The shirt is great but way too long for an average sized woman. Clocking in at just under 5‚Äô6, the shirt tail hit well below my butt, near to mid thigh and the front reach upper thigh. It‚Äôs very soft and lightweight though and I wish I could keep it."
3.0,"I was surprised because I just assumed that most things in this price point and sold from this region ran small in size. But when I got this shirt I wish I would have ordered a large instead of an XL. It's fine, but I feel like it would have been more flattering a little snugger and the size difference would not have changed the length in reference to if I could still wear leggings or not. I also feel like the pockets made my already wide hips wider. After saying all of that, the shirt is still cute and I love the v-neck and length. The sleeves are a great cut and aren't too tight, which can sometimes happen with me. This is not a free return product with Amazon, otherwise I would have returned the shirt and gotten a large and I think I would have been super happy."
3.0,Need to size up! They‚Äôre too small!  Couldn‚Äôt get them sent back in time and it‚Äôs such a damn hassle.
3.0,"My physical therapist suggested I wear this specific shirt.  Unfortunately, as many reviewers have already written, doesn't feel true to size.  I guess I am just in between the M- L/  BUT, more than that, it does not really keep my shoulders back which defeats the whole purpose.  Finally, be prepared to feel very warm while wearing this- it is made entirely of poly and does not breathe, killer during these warm summer months."
3.0,"Not what I expect....I got this for a school bag for My Daughter she is nine years old.... she liked it.... I feel there are Junk Zippers, its poorly made and Zero durability...Not as pretty as picture!"
3.0,Good quality but it's got a lot more of a pink tint tomit in person.
3.0,"I'm 5'2 125 ish pounds. I usually get a small or medium. I got a small in this, and it was just too big and baggy. Cute though if it would have fit nicely. Returned and didn't get a smaller size bc it seems like there is just too much fabric."
3.0,"Hot this for Halloween- its fits weird - like they made this expecting everyone to be on the board of the itty bitty titty committee- the bottom is large- top wo t contain me. I sent the first one back and got the largest size available so I could just tailor it myself and even one 2 sizes bigger couldn't contain the girls and I'm not even a D really. The buttons are barely sewn on, the didn't leave enough material after the buttons so everything wants to just pop open and show the goods. I made the buttons decorative and added velcro to get the job done since it just need to work for one night a year. It is perfect for a retro 50s serial mom outfit"
3.0,"It was a scarf, I bought it for a gift. I haven't opened it yet."
3.0,"The metal tips were too big to fit through the eyelets on my Johnson & Murphy dress shoes so I removed them. I wear dress shoes Monday-Friday and the first set lasted only about 3 weeks before the dreaded pull and snap while getting dressed. They might be good for occasional use but for everyday use, I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Smaller than indicated. Also the fabric is not stretchy enough. Sending back.
3.0,"Really liked look and feel of vest on arrival. Unfortunately, when I put on, I dsicovered the main front zipper was 'reversed.' By that, I mean the zipper pull was on the left like a traditional female garment. I contacted the company and was told they had a 'batch' mistakenly made in the 'European' style. I have no idea how large a batch is or how long before you get one with a traditional style zipper. It may not be an issue to you but I wouldn't have bought had I known so wanted to share. Otherwise seems like a nice vest but I personally don't want to adapt every time I put on so will be returning."
3.0,nice fit and the straw looks like quality. the tightner for the under the chin is a little loose but all in all this is a nice hat.
3.0,"I ordered this item twice. The first color set fit perfectly, love them! I did a 2nd order, different color choice and the 2nd package was too small, too tight although the size was the same as 1st order."
3.0,"This is a who-hum bag.  It looked more high-end in the photo but I think you could find it at most retail, discount stores.  The plus side is that it comes in a great array of colors which cannot be found in most retail stores."
3.0,Love the bag--the style and the color-- and I get lots of compliments when I use it. Customer service is great.
3.0,Me llegaron con una pata virada
3.0,To big to heavy
3.0,The lace is totally different and the shape is not that same as in the photo.
3.0,"These were super adorable, but they're the kind where they print the black ink on the legging instead of the leggings themselves being black. I have found that leggings like this always look dingy after a couple of washes so I returned them. I did think they were super cute though and fit as expected, maybe a tad smaller."
3.0,Item returned. Quality not as expected.
3.0,Just another pair of cheap sunglasses. They are ok for a back up pair but ear pieces loose and lense to eye angle not great.
3.0,"runs big. I have had to wash in hot water multiple times to get it to where it doesn't hang on me like a tent. Love the color, but order a size down."
3.0,"I like this set as it is very well made and sparkly for the price, but the chain was too short for my taste and rather flimsy. When I went to put the pendent on a new chain however I realized that it would not be possible as the opening isn‚Äôt large enough for any of my chains...even the skinny ones! So I am a bit disappointed as I really loved the set...<br /><br />I will keep looking for the perfect chain and in the meantime enjoy the beautiful earrings!"
3.0,"These are ok, but from farther than 2 feet they just look like round earrings and not donuts"
3.0,"Cute and warm, but they dont stay on my daughter's feet."
3.0,Great looking double breasted sports jacket.<br />Unfortunately I brought it one size to small.
3.0,"I love the belt as a belt. It's infinitely adjustable, lending to comfort. The blue fabric is great with jeans, freeing you from having to match belt and shoe color.  And it also looks pretty cool with khakis and shorts.<br /><br />But the bottle opener sucks. I've ordered two of these, on account of my dog eating my last one, and both of them had crappy bottle openers. Granted the bottle opener is a bit more of a novelty than a functional part of the belt... still how hard is it to machine a useable bottle opener into the thing, if that's going to be your big differentiator?<br /><br />So if you're looking for a great fabric belt that's infinitely adjustable, this is a nice option. If you're really sold on the whole bottle opener idea, think again."
3.0,Fabric is beautiful. They are advertised as One Size. They will not fit an XLarge or 1X.
3.0,"one of the stones was missing when I got it, but I just removed it and balanced out the other side to match<br />got a lot of complements on it."
3.0,Runs smaller than expected around hip area. Order one size up.
3.0,"too big. Returned it. I am 5'4&#34;, 120lbs, and 34DD. Going to reorder but get the C."
3.0,GET BIGGER SIZE RUNS SMALL
3.0,"Very pretty but too large. I‚Äôm 36D, 5‚Äô5 and 135 pounds."
3.0,"I purchased the Red and Blue in size Medium. I typically wear a women's size medium in relaxed fit basic t-shirts, 36C bra, size 8 jeans. The Medium fit just like the model, relaxed but not loose or baggy. I have average length arms for my height, about 5'7"", and the sleeves were tiny bit too short. The elbow patches sit a little high, my elbow sits in the middle of the bottom half of the patch. I wasn't thrilled with the patches so I actually removed them which didn't damage the top in any way. The fabric is soft, stretchy and not sheer at all. I washed in cold and put through a hot dryer and if there was any shrinkage it was very minor. Overall the top appears to be fairly well made, I just wish the sleeves were a few inches longer and the patches a little lower."
3.0,"its a bit cheap looking as far as theres still hot glue strings i have to pull off of it, and i dont think it was meant to have feathers on it."
3.0,Broke fairly quick after wearing a few days
3.0,Nice but not for me. I usually like most things by Vince Camuto which leads me to wonder if this is authentic.
3.0,Quality is good but it had an awkward shape
3.0,I‚Äôm not that impressed with the fit of this mask. It‚Äôs loose on me but the material is nice. I figure I will have to alter it to fit me better because it slides down when I talk. Wouldn‚Äôt spend the extra money again.
3.0,Too small o
3.0,I ordered the light pink and it looks light peach. I'm returning it because I wanted a pink for breast cancer awareness.
3.0,Cute but very small .I ordered a 3 and it would fit 12 month.
3.0,This is more childist band. Though it is good for health alert in emergency. I have returned it.
3.0,The red color and design pattern was very cute to try on. It definitely gives off the 1920s vibe and is perfect for parties or special events! The medium size worked well for me and wasn't tight at all. My measurements were 36c 28 waist and 36 hips. What is a drag though is that the dress has a lot of dangling flakes and they come off quite easily. So you might be embarrassed if you go to a party and leave a whole trail of stuff behind...
3.0,Comfy but larger than expected. The zipper is also on the woman's side. (Not a big deal but noted). Decent material.
3.0,"Super flowy, super white, soft, shrinks in length in the dryer. Was too long for my 5‚Äô2‚Äù height anyway. Bought this twice because I enjoyed the first purchase so much and wanted to wear it more often. Great for hot nights."
3.0,Very pretty earrings but smaller than expected. I was looking for something bigger so I returned it.
3.0,looks good but surprising shrinkage after one washing.
3.0,Necklace is beautiful but the lace flips outward while I'm wearing it!
3.0,The bag looked amazing but sad it didn't come in its original coach box
3.0,They run easily
3.0,Under size for American .
3.0,"Too right around chest for a size large, and a bit loose around the mid section. I found myself having to pull on it and continuously adjust during my workout. Would not recommend. Material is also a little itchy."
3.0,Beautiful Dress. Did not receive the belt. It is nothing without the belt.
3.0,nice sunglass ... fits my face
3.0,"a bit pricey for a single, and i agree the ad is misleading. i ended up getting these which are SUPER durable, all seven colors for a great price:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00TUUOCUA Play Silks 7-Color Chiffon Cloth Set]]<br /><br />the other weird/great thing i wouldn't have expected is that the chiffon DOESN'T WRINKLE like silk does--like AT ALL. it just stays flat and smooth somehow. anyway, i recommend that set more! have fun!"
3.0,I think I received a flawed product. The hem was unfinished and stopped at mid-thigh. I had to return it.
3.0,"It is attention getting and easy to use, but the corners are quite sharp.  Wish I had gotten some of the rounded white ones."
3.0,Good dress but arms are very tight
3.0,"It runs a couple sizes small. I'm 5' 5&#34; and 125 pounds, and I barely fit into the Large. Shirt is stretchy, skirt is not. It's cute, and cheap, but so is the craftsmanship. You get about what you expect. I wasn't expecting a stellar costume, so I'm not disappointed, but I'm not thrilled with it either. The bow is detachable. Shipping took about a month. It's a cute costume, but I wouldn't have payed any more than what I did for this."
3.0,It was made  cheap material
3.0,The color was pretty but the fabric has a musky smell to it.  The were snug and the shirt was way too small and the outer garment was way too big.
3.0,"The watch is very nice looking although a little heavy and bulky. The band is pretty stiff when new. I am still trying to loosen it up a little. My biggest problem with this watch is that it keeps terrible time. The analog portion of mine loses about a second a day and the digital part gains a second a day. So the digital and analog are about two seconds apart per day. That may not be a big deal to some, but it drive me nuts."
3.0,I actually bought these for my grandmother to walk on our wooden floors when she came to visit.  They fit a bit on the small side but over all gave her pretty decent grip while walking. Only bad thing is since the material is so thin one of the straps pulled off on one side of a pairs the first time using it. Other than that no complaints.
3.0,its a cute hat but really fits a child sized head
3.0,"the button popped off the second time i wore these pants. i think i can reattach easily, but i'm taking off 2 stars for this because it's really annoying. the pants fit as expected and the material they're made out of is comfortable. other than the button issue, they seem to be well-made pants."
3.0,"If you're a size 10 or smaller then these pants are for you....if not, don't waist your money.  Even if I could squeeze into them, they fit like skinny jeans."
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 weigh 140 and wear a size 8 or 10 pants.  While the material is very nice and soft, I found these pants to be too tight."
3.0,Fits smaller then expected!
3.0,"This shirt was the right price... so I gave it a chance. I have yet to wear it outside of my bedroom. The material is OK- I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs great. Some of the holes weren‚Äôt all the way punched through, so I had to poke some through manually. This is all OK.<br />My problem with it is that the front of the shirt barely comes down to my belly button. The picture shown does not have it that way. I expected the back to be a little longer, but the back only just comes to my butt. The waist is also large, which I expected- to be loose- but again, it is not large in proportion to the rest of the shirt. It is too loose.<br />I‚Äôve held onto it in case I‚Äôm able to get away with wearing it with my waist-high skirts. Otherwise, I‚Äôll give it to my 6 year old niece."
3.0,"I love the idea.  They are much more comfortable than the traditional goggles.  They're such a hit that now other folks are making similar products.  (I believe these were the original ones).  This company also now makes just the strap to put on other brand goggles or replacement goggles.  The reason I only give it 3 stars is that they didn't last long.  Yes, they frayed after a short while, but that didn't bother me because they can still be used.  Yes, they got scratched, but what goggles don't get scratched up by a 4-5 year old boy?  But after only 9 months of--at most--once a week usage, the lenses popped out and I can't get them back on!  I may try a different brand next time.  If I remember next year, I'll try to post how these compared.<br />IMO, the price of these is a tad high for a product that is so disposable.  If it were less expensive, I'd definitely buy these again."
3.0,"This is a pretty ring, but it's very thin, so barely visible. I would probably like it better if I had a few of them stacked together. Now it's just too small and thin."
3.0,cute but will probably never be worn by me
3.0,"I like the how simple this is to take off and put on. I also like the simple,casual style. However, it snags on everything. I ruined as nice shirt wearing this, so I had to stop wearing it."
3.0,"I was really looking forward to wearing these at the gym, however, these leggings are not how I expected. They are a bit loose‚Äã around my waist and give me a MAJOR camel toe. They're cute and comfortable though, so I will only be wearing them at home."
3.0,Bought this in the deals of the day. Looks better in the picture. The listed price is way too expansive. Sale price is more reasonable but wouldn't say it is a steal at all. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,The shirt is really cute and material is good quality but the size of the shirt seems a little smaller.
3.0,Good for cosplay but it only fits a small face and it‚Äôs quite heavy. Mine shattered after it was dropped about 1.5 feet/45.72 centimeters.
3.0,"Quality, flexibility and style is great! Sizing is horrible! This was 2xl and as 180lb 5'3 I did manage to get it on with the first button off but it was not flattering at all! Looked like I was 9 mths pregnant. I know Im big but damn! Need to be around 32"" waist and 24"" thigh to look nicely unless you have some confidence to rock the belly lol"
3.0,I do like the design.  The vest fits larger than two others I have purchased from the same maker.  It also has a bit of a cheaper look while the other two I own have a higher quality look.  A bit disappointing but I kept it nonetheless since I will wear it for casual.
3.0,I'm 5'4 195 and a 42B.  I bought an XX Large which fits except for the bust.  The top of the dress looks deflated on me.  I would need to stuff my bra with cantaloupes in order for this dress to fit.<br /><br />A good dress if you need to smuggle produce.
3.0,"The material is alot thinner than i had expected, its more of a light hoodie material than a jacket. Still cute just not warm."
3.0,Get a medium if you want one of these im sure itll fit almost anyone unless your john sena or somin
3.0,"For the discounted price, they are okay. Nothing like Ahnu or Birkenstock."
3.0,"I like it but it wasn't the perfect. The fit was a little off. My wife didn't like it ,so it really didn't matter if i liked it or not. its a nice buy for a quick fix thats inexpensive."
3.0,These run big!! The part that holds the sack wax a little smaller than expected.
3.0,"Very nice and pretty for the price. Unfortunately, one of my studs broke the first day. :( If you purchase, be careful upon wearing."
3.0,"The keychain was as depicted in the pictures, but much smaller than I had imagined. But that's my issue for not checking measurements. It was also only six dollars so worth ordering multiples of various sneakers to make a more substantial item. I would recommend this product."
3.0,"I bought a pair of these sandals, which were delivered about two months ago.  They took a few days to break in (maybe it was my feet that got broken in), but now I'm wearing them virtually all day because they're comfortable and cool.  Unfortunately, the buckle on one came apart yesterday.  I was able to put it back together because I had pliers in my pocket, but I was not happy to have this happen when the shoes were so new, and I'm worried that the cheap bit of sheet metal is going to bend open again soon."
3.0,"Fits just like the photo, but the fabric is cheap, nylon like a costume. Will definitely ride up as you wear it. Sleeves are a bit short."
3.0,We were only able to wear these one time before a hole came in them.
3.0,The dress is too short. I am 6'11 and a 22 fit me way above the knees. The dress is light and pretty physically. I will save for a Christmas party.
3.0,Its OK but got the item damaged with scratch marks
3.0,Print was nice but it ended up being a weird spandex material and also too short - I am 5‚Äô10 and was at least 3-4 inches too short.
3.0,Is huge compared to the regular size of a normal Italian horn.
3.0,"These are soft and stretchy, but the legs are just TOO TIGHT for the size - cheapens what could have been a great look!"
3.0,"Used for a halloween costume so it was fine, but I would not be able to wear this dress normally as it is VERY thin fabric and the bottom is basically see-thru."
3.0,It is extremely large for me
3.0,Good looking earrings. I love the color !! But they don't stay fasten always falling off!!!
3.0,"My son has spider-man and the hulk in this same exact brand but for some reason, his CA mask is super tight! I had to loosen it but it wasn‚Äôt enough. Bought the one at Target for $3 during October and he wears that over this one."
3.0,"Decent replica of the greatest professional wrestling championship belt ever!  I‚Äôm glad it doesn‚Äôt have the WWE logo, but it‚Äôs plain just like the WCW one was. The plates are extremely flat, so you will want to try and curve them.  Also, the strap isn‚Äôt the greatest, so I suggest getting it releathered if possible."
3.0,"This camera strap is essentially a knock-off of the Peak Design Slide Light. The fabric used is surprisingly rugged for its inexpensive price point, but that's where the comparisons end. The biggest issue with the Newtty Kay strap is the quick attach feature. The strap uses a piece of metal to keep the anchor mounts in place, but once you pop them out of the strap, they are very difficult to get back in. Once back in place, they don't sit as well as they did before they were initially removed.<br /><br />The other difference between this strap and the more expensive Slide is the slider. The Slide has two sliders to adjust the strap, but this only has one. Further, the description here says it is ""glass reenforced"", likely because that is how the Slide is described, but it is just a plastic slider.<br /><br />All of that said, this is a nice little strap for the price. You're not going to be able to pop the quick attach buttons in and out very easily, but for only $11.99, it's a decent alternative for people on a budget. Just be aware you aren't getting anything on the same level as the Slide."
3.0,"These gloves were fantastic in that their warm, simply, and have the right kind of thumb openings I was looking for.  The 3 star rating is because they're definitely not going to last the entire season.  I've been wearing them for two months and they are not holding up well.  Lots of unraveling just from going in and out of my coat pockets."
3.0,"This is exactly what it looks like. I ordered it on April 30 and received it June 15 from India, I believe. I wish there was a way to get some of these things faster."
3.0,"The length is good and it's cute, but the fabric feels like thin plastic. Not really uncomfortable, just not what I'm used to. Also, it fits but putting it on over a wet swimsuit is hard. I'd suggest ordering a size larger than you usually wear. Also a bit snug in the shoulders."
3.0,I love this set! My only complaint is that a few of the ones that I would say are the better metal material won‚Äôt stay clasped which was a big disappointment :(
3.0,These are very warm and the bottoms fit appropriately however the top was short and my daughter is on the smaller side of 18 months so id order 1 size bigger than normal
3.0,"was told to order 1/2 size bigger, still too small.  wore them till they stretched out"
3.0,"Holes in toes after one wash, but there is so many pairs- still feel good about it. These stay put, and are thinner than I wished for. Price was right"
3.0,Beautiful dress that fits great but there was a a 2‚Äù defect in the band by the zipper in which the waist band was sown into the bodice. I still wore it anyways but I was very disappointed when I saw it.
3.0,Very heavy for keys. I ended up taking the body off and just keeping the head on my keys. Still super cute
3.0,"Runs really small. I ordered a size up and it‚Äôs still too tight. Shirt looks cute and just like the picture, but material is thin"
3.0,"Not as thick as I thought they would be, You can punch a hold in them with your fork or finger. The are ok for the price.They are longer than I expected and sit in your lap."
3.0,"Shirt is really cute but runs small. Also very short in the front, returned."
3.0,"Great underwear but for the price, I didn't think it was worth it. I am equally happy with the Jinshi underwear and it's like 1/3 of the price."
3.0,Small at the chest
3.0,Like the look and feel but little short for me.
3.0,It looks great.  I loved the look and style of it however I wore it once and only had my badge attached to it so it wasn't like it was anything heavy and one of the chains already broke.  I setup a return for it already.
3.0,Fits alright. The clasp is a bit difficult to deal with.
3.0,The links are very thin. Otherwise it looks great.
3.0,"I'm on the fence about this.  I thought it would be a great idea, I just don't think it's for me.  I bought it for my husband and it's a cool concept but it feels a little like a toy to me.  Not saying that the product is bad, just that it's not for me.  I'm a 'metal' kind-of-girl, ya know?"
3.0,Bottoms run small! Very cute suit but I won't be able to use the bottoms. They are tiny. I am 5'5&#34; 135 lbs size 8. The medium bottoms were way to small. I should be able to use the top however.
3.0,Nice fit but neck stretches out
3.0,"Bought this as a rehearsal wedding dress and thank god we got it with enough time to make alterations and get the right bra because the back was too low for a regular bra so I had to get a strapless, and the length of the dress was awkward so had to make an adjustment there. Otherwise, it did the trick for the event."
3.0,The sweater was small for being a large
3.0,"I loved these sunglasses, they were just the right size and fit very well.  Unfortunately they broke within the first few weeks of use.  I guess the screw was not attached very well because the one side piece came off completely."
3.0,The fabric shows every roll you have if your a bigger girl like myself
3.0,"This helmet fits fine, but unlike the image shown, there are several gaps in the weave of the straw - if you intend to use for beekeeping (this item is advertised in conjunction with beekeeping veils that fit over the brim), this is really not ideal."
3.0,"nice quality, did not fit, buy a larger size."
3.0,"The Robe is everything I was looking for...lightweight, pretty color, sizing very close...just a bit smaller than true size. But it feels a little itchy on the outside.  Inside, when wearing it I didn't notice it was itchy, just on the outside.  I washed it as soon as I got it.  Washing fine but didn't dry it.  Will try that next time.  Wanted to be sure the washing didn't shrink and it didn't.  Once I dry it, I think it will feel even softer. I think it contains a lot of sizing that eventually will wash out. I really wanted a lightweight flannel robe but this was almost a good.<br />It may be terrycloth, but it's more nubby than terrycloth.<br />All in all, I like it and I think the more washings it has, the better it will be."
3.0,I got these from a store once size 5 and when I ordered them online the size 5 was more like a size 7.  This flip flop is really really comfortable.
3.0,Beautiful color.  Loved the length. Material was thin.  More of an empire waist than natural waistline.
3.0,"These are very pretty and look great, but small. I bought them for my niece who is 1yr old and they leave a mark on her head. She is of average size, so I'm not satisfied with these."
3.0,Dress is beautiful however I ordered black and I received black with white polka dots
3.0,made a little cheaper than i expected
3.0,The Tiara is great! Amazing quality too but the sash....its like it was made for a child..super small should be way longer...not sure why its so short....it all looks great but disappointed in the size of sash...
3.0,"I have a couple pairs of these shoes and really like them. That being said, the last couple pairs, this one included, have busted out in the toe area within two months.Makes me sad because I really like these shoes. They are two expensive to only have for a couple of months, however."
3.0,While it did fit as an xl (I'm usually a 14 jean/xl 1x shirt 38ddd) I am 5'4 and i will have to hem it about 2 inches so I'm not walking on it. My biggest disappointment was the plaid skirt part of the dress looked... um.. cheap. Not as rich as it is in the picture. But overall ok. Not a $30 dress.
3.0,"I've bought this about 2-3 times now. I wear it about every other day and within 2-3 months, the end of the arrow (fletching) starts to get rusty. I keep buying it though because there aren't cheaper or better alternatives yet that I can find. Looks good when it isn't rusting and because of the symmetric look on both sides, it doesn't matter if it's rotated in your ear like some arrow."
3.0,"Cheap, thin material and weird bunches of fabric were the different color fabrics meets. Returned."
3.0,They're extremely too large...the straps need to be tightened around the calf muscles
3.0,The item is smaller than depicted. Mine also came and the backs to the pins didnt actually hold the needle at all and had to be replaced since they couldnt hold at all.<br />There was also a ton of extra scrap metal all over them that i will have to clean up and fix. The rings also are hanging out of one fang and i will need to get new rings to hold the chains because it seems the ones it came with are too small to come from both fangs (have the entire mouth of the beast holding the ring that holds the chains).<br />They also arent as clean and nicely carved as shown as in the picture. Very poor craftsman ship. I feel like this is more like getting the materials to make a lapel chain rather than actually buying one. False advertising on multiple levels.
3.0,A bit bigger than I expected.
3.0,"This visor does not roll up.  It does fold in half naturally if you place it in a beachbag or backpack, but this creates a permanent crease that folds down the center of the visor.  Unattractive in the end."
3.0,"I would probably not buy these boots again. I paid a lot of money for made in the USA boots and I expect top notch boots. I‚Äôve had these boots for a couple months now and have worn them a lot. The right heel has such a bad squeak that people near me can hear it when I walk. I decided to forgo any long inconvenient process for having the boots repaired or replaced. Instead I cut the inside liner open with a razor blade to figure out what was causing the squeak. The left book, which has never squeaked, has the liner layers glued together really well. The right boot had a very poor glue application. Two layers of the liner near the heel slide against each other causing the squeak.  I sprayed all the liner layers with contact adhesive and put it back together. Hopefully that takes care of it.  I like buying USA built things but it‚Äôs very frustrating when the quality is inferior to similar products built overseas."
3.0,it looks a bit bad the finish is little nice.
3.0,"Pretty earrings.  Looked like the photo.  Wire a bit short in the back.  Returning because not the color I wanted, to match a bracelet, and due to short wire.  It was sent in a cute gift box.  I've posted a photo of them."
3.0,Shirt was huge
3.0,"These are snug fitting, although adorable and probably warm, the liner pulls out with the hand. It is the only down side. We bought 2 pairs and my girls will probably re-gift them to someone with smaller hands."
3.0,The price was right.
3.0,The colors are not that vibrant. The material is okay. I would have loved it if it contained more variety of colors. The pastel shades looks little dull.
3.0,My Wife loves them and my daughter hates them....<br />Cant comment on how the wear because my daughter wont wear them but the look good in pics...<br /><br />But She is a sneaker head like her dad so what can I really say...
3.0,The top fit perfect but the bottoms were too large.
3.0,"I ordered a print in this dress and liked the print, weight of the material, and fit very much. The fuschia, so I thought was lighter than what's reflected in the picture and the material was much thinner. As a curvy woman, the thin material did more clinging that I liked. If you don't mind a lighter shade and thin material then it's okay."
3.0,I give it an A for style and swag but hat is big and it looks like very odd on my head. It doesn't appear to be designed for women which is ironic with the mom life logo.
3.0,The top fit fine but the bottoms were small! Not made for people with a booty
3.0,"Es un reloj muy sencillo, se pueden ver bien los n√∫meros. Por el precio que se paga, esta muy bien el reloj."
3.0,Expected more upper support
3.0,"Cute top, fits snug, or form fitting, as it probably should. I just happen to like my shirts a little more baggy on me. Funky material but from other reviews I was expecting that. The arms do run tight but this may also be because I lift weights so most sleeved shirts fit a little tighter. Probably wouldn't buy again even in a larger size."
3.0,"These hats are really cute and are great for my son. However, only one of the three I received had the fleece lining on the inside."
3.0,Looks different from picture.  Has a spotty type pattern & very cheaply made.  Stitching was already loose when arrived.
3.0,Lint gets everywhere.  It's like cat hair.
3.0,it was a gift to myself and I like it
3.0,Came apart in two days and had to be super-glued back together. It looks good after my expert super-glue skills were applied lol
3.0,"The photo misrepresented the product...Very, very small."
3.0,Hat is listed as one size...hats are not simply one size. This fits the top of ur skull...doesn't come down to the ears like an average hat. If u are buying for an adult make sure they have a child sized head!
3.0,"I like these sunglasses since they are oversized but they are aa really odd shape, not rounded around the edges they are a little bit sharper. They look black in the picture but that is because the flash is on it really is a nice silver and reflective. The metal does feel a little thin like it could break and it is not sturdy, I understand that they are lightweight but even if they were a little heavier I would not mind if the metal frame was thicker. That could just be personal preference though."
3.0,"These are really great the first wear or two, but they shrink after a while and keep popping off inside your shoes!"
3.0,"I loved this purse.  It's simple and gorgeous.... BUT, after only a few weeks of use, the zipper no longer zips, which, combined with the design of the bag, deems it utterly useless and a spill hazard.  So disappointed!"
3.0,I bought this for my rook piercing and can't get it to fit with these sharp angles.. It's durable though.
3.0,"Ok, for the price, but sizing is off, runs super small. I returned them."
3.0,"This is a lesson in &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  While they arrived on time and there were 40 cheap plastic finger lights, 1/3 of them didn't work. They either arrived on so the batteries ran down or the switches were faulty in some way so that they wouldn't stay on unless held down in strange angles. I'm glad I had enough for my students but had I known I had to cull the herd, I might have made a different choice. Still, the ones that did work met my expectations, if that means something.<br /><br />*** amended review.  The seller read the review and gave me a discount on the broken lights. The people were prompt in offering the price adjustment, which I appreciate, even with the not so subtle request to give 4 or 5 stars for the price adjustment. I'll give 2 thumbs up for the quick response, the refund, and courteous customer service."
3.0,I love the color but very uncomfortable to walk in. Your feet slide when walking.
3.0,This belt is hard to thread through the loops of pants.
3.0,"I'd like to give four stars but I went with 3 for a few reasons:<br />I thought it was going to be red white and blue based on the picture in color. It it's actually black, not blue. Also, it's circles and not stars.<br />The other reason I didn't love it was because I have to wear a cami or something underneath. The arm holes are much too long and my bra always shows if I don't.<br />That being said, I still like the shirt very much and have worn it a few times. Another good point to mention was that It arrived much quicker than I had expected, especially coming from China.<br /><br />It should be noted that there are no care instructions on this shirt anywhere to be found, not even on the packaging. However, taking a risk and crossing my fingers, I washed it in a delicate cycle in cold water and it came out fine. It is a very fine, cheap material so I don't expect to have this shirt for years to come, but if I can wear it memorial day, fourth of July, and labor day I'd say I got my money worth."
3.0,Not true to size. My sister ordered the largest size and it doesn‚Äôt fit like it should. But a pretty dress
3.0,Picture looks more elegant than the actual item. I was going to give it as a gift but I have changed my mind. It‚Äôs pretty but just seems to be s little clunky.
3.0,Rubber pieces around the eyes kept falling out.
3.0,If I lifted my arms then anyone looking from the side would have a clear view because it pushed off my chest and fashion tape didn't stick to it :/<br />But it was super cute and I looked amazing at prom because of it.<br /><br />32 DD
3.0,is very thin. is not good quality
3.0,These are super long. Almost like a dress.
3.0,"Nice fabric, fits ok, faded in 1 wash."
3.0,Too wide for the shoelace holes. Wish they were narrower and not so &#34;showie&#34;
3.0,These snapped in so I didnt have to worry about them coming loose and loosing them. They were perfect to wear for work.
3.0,"This should be listed as youth size, not adult size, very small. Looks very nice, however just don't thinking will fit my husband's wrist."
3.0,Runs small. Get 1 size higher.
3.0,Leather is not high quality. Fit was too small. However very easy to return so +1 star for Amazon customer service
3.0,"the fabric is different than what is pictured. it looks to be chiffon type of material in the photo, but it is not in person."
3.0,LONG LONG LONG and took several months to ship
3.0,"These have great designs, but are big. They fall down."
3.0,"It's not rose gold, it's copper colored. Nonetheless, my GF liked it."
3.0,A bit baggy. I have not worn them because of the fit and it is a pain to return items.
3.0,The shipping was good and they look great. I love them.... but the lens are black. I didnt order black I order lavender. But not spending them back they'll been fine I guess.
3.0,"The company says ""true to size"".. NOT true. Normally I wear 2-3xl in elastic band shorts and they are always a lil loose.. not these.. they are too tight and I can't even use the drawstrings.. bigger guys should order 4xl if you normally wear a 3 XL. Total waste of time."
3.0,"It fits me, but it would not fit you comfortably if you were larger than size S, and it's not adjustable. Quality seems ok for the price.<br /><br />I don't really like it. Someone said they curved the plate part and it looked better--maybe that's what I have to do. At the moment, the gold part pretty much spans across the whole front of my waist, and it looks funny to me."
3.0,This is a flimsy product.  I would not wear it anywhere special. The color is good but the dress is cheap. I wanted a more structured item.
3.0,Work ok but I dont like the smell of it. Highly recommend put some perfume while wesaring it
3.0,Do not note any reduction in temperature
3.0,It does not keep your hands warm as they say.  Very comfortable and the touchscreen you have to get use to how to place your fingers.
3.0,Nice but quality no so good
3.0,It‚Äôs ok. Fit a little big but also lost elasticity very quickly.
3.0,"These earrings are okay. However, they are not dainty enough for me."
3.0,Design faded to quick
3.0,"These look great, but the material isn't as sturdy/stiff as I like for our squid hats.  But they're a great addition for the new members on our trivia team, The Giant Squid."
3.0,Nice enough strap but I wanted a chunky looking one and this one is a lot thinner than it looks on the pictures. My own fault I should have checked the measurements before ordering.
3.0,"These are nice warm gloves, well made but for one thing - the lining on the left hand seems to be a bit too short for the glove and so you must work your fingers into it a bit.  ITo quote reviewer, LT:  &#34;....the liner twists and just generally doesn't seem to fit the inside of the gloves. It's a struggle to put them on, ...&#34;  Probably should go up a size.<br /><br />t's too much trouble to return, so I'll just wear them as they are warm and match my winter white coat nicely."
3.0,"I liked the fabric. Soft and feels good on the skin, but didn‚Äôt fit my figure. I‚Äôm proportional, 5,7‚Äô, slim, Bcup. But when I put it on it only fit around the waist and hips. It was way too long (maybe 7‚Äô or so), so skirt flared way to low and didn‚Äôt seems proportional. On the shoulder it felt like shoulder on the dress will fall and when lifting arm it had extra fabric under the arm. I have short dress with the same low back and long sleeve, so I have something to compare."
3.0,I returned this item as the fabric although listed as 96% cotton was very slick- not as a expected.
3.0,It was a little tight under the arms and the quality of the flannel was just o.k.
3.0,The seams pull apart so you can see them but has yet to rip and it's see through
3.0,"The dress I ordered is not the same red as shown in the display. Instead of being a rich, deep red, the fabric is more of a childish fire-engine red. The material is thin and very see through, so you need to wear a cami underneath it. Otherwise it's a nice, light, summer dress. But because of the color and material, it does look a bit on the cheap side."
3.0,It was good for the first few days but then the watch part inside stopped.
3.0,"For the price, ok. One leg is shorter than the other and, well, there are  high waters on me.  Im 5.6 tall and i wear black socks.I hope no one notices"
3.0,No es de el mismo color rojo como se ve en foto pero esta bien
3.0,I could not use this out fit After I got it . It was too big . Blessed a friend with the dress.
3.0,They were a little tighter then I expected. But I'm walking the tightness out. They're getting more comfortable.. So good to go!
3.0,I have to sew the Velcro back on because it tore off but honestly they are really nice other than that one
3.0,Love the material. I like the front pockets. I ordered a medium and it fits nicely except over the breasts. It‚Äôs too tight.
3.0,L0ve the bling
3.0,I don't care for the material!
3.0,"This is a gorgeous dress, just as pictured.  I read the reviews and ordered a size 10 even though I only wear an 8, it still was too small.  Unfortunately, had to return it."
3.0,By the picture it looks like you get 3 of these but you only get 1. The ring is very small and barely fit my 8 year old granddaughters little finger! She is a little taller than most 8 year old but in great proportion to her height. Very cute though. They do need to make them a bit larger! Cheap price for cheap ring!
3.0,These gloves are way to large for my husband I think I will wash them and see if they will shrink some. I think they would be great if they were smaller
3.0,"After reading many reviews I decided or order a medium. I am 5'3 115lbs and generally wear a medium bottom and small top (34B). The bottom piece was very tight and not stretchy. The top cup sizes fit, but I had to tie it weird so the straps weren't loose... I purchased to wear on a vacation to Maui and opted for my older more comfortable swim suit. Will probably wear it eventually but over all it doesnt fit well. It was cheap so I knew I wasn't getting anything fancy but would have preferred to pick a large bottom and small top based on how it fit..."
3.0,Like the buckle design and belt material but was disappointed at the length. Compared to others of same size it appears short. Suspect it is to do with the buckle design. Recommend go up a size but then it is expensive when compared to other options out there. No issues with shipping- that was great.
3.0,This swimsuit was very cute but not for me. I'm very top heavy (34DDD) and this offered no support. It fit very nicely every where else. I had to return this product. There are no cups or support to hold you chest in. I would not recommend for top heavy women. I returned this product.
3.0,"I bought it with a discount code for like 4 bucks. Smells funky, like it was made from process plastic."
3.0,They were not what I expected..
3.0,they are too large didn't think they were going to be that big
3.0,Runs 2 sizes smaller
3.0,Nice ones
3.0,"I like these, could fit little better but great glasses"
3.0,Very fragile. But like them and they don't irritate my skin.
3.0,Was a bit on  the large side.
3.0,It‚Äôs adorable it‚Äôs just absolutely humongous so if you were a small petite woman like myself a kid size might be better
3.0,It is REALLY big. Too big for me.
3.0,Love this bracelet but the charms always fall off.
3.0,Literally.stretch pants. Husband didn't like them at all.
3.0,"The beads fall off at the bottom side which you also use to loosen or tighten... also it is liable to come untied or frayed, I only had mine for an hour or two, and it happened to me despite my gentle nature...1 down.. 1 left , it won't take too long to lose the other one!  :-("
3.0,So these fit however they shrunk when dried and are not meant for anyone tall
3.0,"The shirt would be good if it were as expected. The color is ""winter white,"" and the picture shows something very close to white, but the actual color is a cream color, not very close to white. Additionally, I normally wear a M but ordered an XL because of the sizing chart, and it was too big. A L would've been better and a M would probably be tight if that's what I was looking for.<br /><br />Not saying the shirt is ""bad""--just that the color isn't as advertised."
3.0,It‚Äôs cute but some orange is on the white part and the smaller ones are cute but the bigger mushrooms with the small hoops look a bit wonky. The small ones are very cute though.
3.0,Runs very small and the material isn't as nice as I thought it was.  I will be returning
3.0,"Normally, I wear woman‚Äôs small size so I got medium since these shorts run small. The mediums r more like extra small. The legs r too short for my taste and comfort and the waist is so thick with elastic to cut off your circulation. Extremely uncomfortable."
3.0,"This sweater is nice.  I ordered a Large and an Extra Large because of the significant size differentiation between handmade items.  The large was too small, and the XL fits perfectly, but the left pocket was not attached at the cuff.  Unfortunately, Amazon did not have a way to exchange the sweater, and the price went up significantly.  I contacted the seller who said Amazon should have an exchange feature on returns.  No such luck.  There's always next year. :("
3.0,"Looks nice, hasn't tarnished but the clasp broke after 5 months, wearing 1-2 times a week."
3.0,Just gave it to my sister. I thought I selected a Lg.
3.0,Absolutely the cutest ever! Really not large enough for many older children and women.
3.0,Kind of small.  More like a child's toy.  Heavy though.
3.0,"More for babies, than older girls. RUns very small."
3.0,"Wish the length was a 1/4 longer.  Great casual boot with legging. Toe box, width  & arch support good fit"
3.0,"Purchased lightening deal. Super cute good quality, except the backs didnt fit(bent the post trying to put them on). Much smaller than anticipated (pinky nail crescent size)but still pretty & worth every cent."
3.0,I returned this item because I did not like the fabric.  I was expecting the normal sweatshirt fabric but I have no idea what this was made of.  It seemed almost scratchy.
3.0,"They are so cute !! But a little to big, Looks very good on my hubby and looks blah on Me go figure ! Lol"
3.0,"Wanted to love these but the top is very clingy and long-not flattering (I‚Äôm an XL). The pockets can fit a phone, but it feels like it will pop out because it‚Äôs small. They are soft, which is nice."
3.0,For my Apple Watch!
3.0,"So in truth this deserves a zero star rating but my daughter decided she could use it so I am giving it one star.  Here is the deal I ordered a 2x I typically can sport an xl but I find its better to go up a size when ordering online.  Any who lets start with the color this is an unusual shade of yellow it reminds me a bit of the color of fabric that has been sun bleached.  As far as the size goes it is no where near a size 2x unless of course the intent was to use it as an incredibly tight crop top, and judging from the display picture that is not the intentions of this blouse.  As a joke I asked my 12-year old daughter to throw it on and although considerably looser on her 5'1&#34; 135 pound frame it still looked nothing like the picture.  What I thought would be a laugh turned into seriousness when my daughter asked if she could keep it, did she love it ehhh but she thought it would be better than using her heavy hoodie when its not super cold and she is walking to the bus stop.<br /><br />Update:  the company responded quickly 2 my negative experience and gave me 10% off my purchase because I chose to let my daughter keep the sweater excellent customer service"
3.0,Presentation and look was nice.  Started to change color a little bit and chain broke after a couple of weeks.
3.0,"I'm 5'4"" tall. 34F bust.  I wear size 4 in jeans and Small/ Medium in tops. I'm hourglass shaped. It accommodates my boobs and butt well..stars deducted because the fabric could've been better. It's a cotton jersey t-shirt type fabric."
3.0,"I got 3 colors, all have the exact same distressing in the exact same spot.  A bit oversized, so you could easily size down if you need to, or want a more fitted look."
3.0,Missing hook to earing fixed myself so qouldnt go through the hassle
3.0,I absolutely love these but I can't get them in.....they are a 0g with 00g flare. I have tries to get them in but can without poping my ear....
3.0,"Material is more of a running material. The top is a color block; however, the way it was sewn there is a clear divide between each material which causes weird laying issues when worn. Overall, fits well but has its issues."
3.0,I did not find these to be Easy-Off any more than other compression socks.
3.0,Bought this watch for my daughter. She has been wanting a watch that she could read the time and would also count her steps. This watch does a horrible job counting steps. She can be standing in place and it continues to count as if she is still walking.
3.0,"Nice,for the price."
3.0,Very nice &#34;ugly&#34; sweater however it could be a bit larger. The one size fits all is not a good idea for this product.
3.0,Dress was super cute but even taking the comments into consideration and bumping up a size the dress was impossible to zip without a second person.  As often there is no one else around this is an issue.
3.0,Fit is great. Unfortunately I had to return my dress because it was see through. I ordered the white.
3.0,Ok not as warm as I imagined
3.0,"This was a nice sweater, fit well, but was not nearly as heavy-weight as it appeared in the picture.  I was looking for something that was heavier - WARMER! - so I returned it."
3.0,"Smaller then expected,  wish it was a little larger. But still love the purse."
3.0,"Really nice gloves but way, way too big. I usually wear women‚Äôs small gloves (north face & lululemon) but no smalls were available when I ordered this. I measured my hand according to their instructions and around my knuckles measured 8‚Äù, putting me right in the middle of their ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù size. I ordered a Medium and hoped they‚Äôd fit, but they were huge. My boyfriend wears men‚Äôs XL gloves and I had him try these Mediums on and they fit him. Sadly, I‚Äôll be returning these gloves and going with a different brand with smaller sizes available"
3.0,arrives over a month late.  be sure to watch for the size - it is in centimeters not inches  -  about 13X4X11 inches or so.  I do like the colors and material.
3.0,Nice looking shirt but cheaply made
3.0,Acrylic beads. Not good quality.
3.0,Shein always has the cutest dresses.  However- every one I‚Äôve gotten smashes my boobs.  I haven‚Äôt yet found  a Shein dress I  can wear and it‚Äôs annoying.  Dress will fit everywhere else but there‚Äôs never room for boobs.  They get smooshed down and end up a lumpy square.  SHEIN‚Äî- SOME PEOPLE HAVE BOOBS!!!
3.0,Good Product. But To small for a Adult man. Even less if you use prescription glasses.
3.0,"So this is the best jacket I have ever bought myself in my life. By that I mean the most expensive and not just a North Face jacket. I needed something that will actually keep me warm as I am always cold and NJ winters can be all over the place. When I received the jacket I went and tried it on. I bought a large just to fit more things underneath and it fits great. I am not drowning in it and I can comfortably fit more layers on underneath. It is VERY WARM. I put it on to walk my dog and felt comfortable. The only complaint I have is the fact that some of the feathers are falling out and some of the stitching is messed up. After spending $100+ on this I want it to be 100% perfect. I inspected the jacket as a whole and just am disappointed with the few flaws. I did email the selling and the told me to send it back for a new one but I do not want to wait for another jacket as I am in need of one. Plus the price went up since my purchase. All and all would recommend as it is a great, cheaper version of the legit brand and it does the job of keeping you warm.<br /><br />EDIT 2020:<br />I had to have the zipper redone as the big one on the jacket broke off. I had the cleaners fix all the pockets."
3.0,"I like this shirt but it's not the exact same pattern as they show in the picture. It's a muted blue, and the flowers aren't as pretty as they are in the picture. The bottom of the shirt also flairs out, it's not fitted what so ever.  You'll need to wear skinny jeans with it or you'll look frumpy."
3.0,It's spread wider than I thought it would be. Profile of the item is more like a V shape.
3.0,"The sleeves are attached in a way that makes it very difficult to keep them not sloppy particularly behind the arm. It seems like they could have cut that a little differently to make it a better fit but what do I expect for the price I paid. The other problem is that the lace going under the boning is cut instead of being one piece which means that when you tighten it it pulls the 1 /100th of an inch bit of lace away from the boning and causes a gap that is very noticeable. It does look very nice when on especially under a jacket or another shirt that's open. The lacing in the back is a little strange since they basically have it set to tie in the middle instead of at the top or the bottom but that's fixable. If you need a cheap one or two time use corset 4 costume this would get that done, I don't expect it to last long as otherwise at least not in good condition to be seen. It might well last for wearing as an undergarment."
3.0,"Was expecting a bigger help for glare.  As I get older, the night glare is big issue."
3.0,I don't know if they are good or bad.  Case is nice.  They are too small for my head.  I tossed them in my<br />travel bag in case I ever forget my other glasses.
3.0,too small won't fit
3.0,"So cute! But it has no stretch and was too tight for me... if you have a bigger bust maybe go up a size. I gave this to a friend and she loves it, but unfortunately I could not fit the dress."
3.0,"Very cute purse, but my phone barely fits."
3.0,"It‚Äôs cute probably for shorter girls. But wasn‚Äôt that flattering on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 135lbs with a long torso. It rid up pretty high & the waistline was kind of ‚ÄúSteve Urkel‚Äù on me even with the straps extended. But I like that it‚Äôs all see through, it‚Äôs a sexy piece. My hubby will probably still like it anyways lol."
3.0,"hurt the ears a little, inside rubber could be cut smother"
3.0,"Awhile back I bought a similar jacket and went by the size chart and ordered an XL...way too small. Return to China was more hassle than it's worth so I gave it to my GF...she likes it, I'd say it's about a men's M. This time I got a 2XL and it's like a fat guy lab coat. These things are all over the map size-wise...for reference I'm 6', about 180#, 32 waist w what you might call an &quot;athletic&quot; build...V-shaped as my sweetie says. Normally a 44 L. My advice is take the leap, it's a decent casual jacket, just make sure you pick one w free returns...it might take a few tries to get it right."
3.0,"Love the color, love the softness of the material, and don‚Äôt like the length of the sleeves on me. The shirt length is fine, but it‚Äôs not flared enough for me so it‚Äôs too clinging. This shirt feels like it would fit someone taller. It washes and dries easily."
3.0,"I liked this top and fabric quite a bit, but found it short for a tunic top. I expected the large size to fully cover the business in the back, and unfortunately that wasn't the case."
3.0,Looks nice but way too tight; bought 2 XL
3.0,"Very lightweight and easy to remove links if necessary. The picture does not quite describe how slim the band is though. If you were looking for a smaller band, this is perfect for you! I wear mine all the time, just wish I would have known it wasn‚Äôt as wide as I normally get."
3.0,I wear 8.5 or 9<br />These are very narrow<br />Stitching is coming undone..<br />Dissatisfied<br />Disappointed
3.0,"Runs very very small,(fits my 8yr old wrist... )but other than that their very PRETTY..!"
3.0,"I purchased this necklace for my son. My husband always wears a cross around his neck. Has for many years. So, recently, my son wanting to be just like his father, has repeatedly asked for a necklace of his own. When I came across this, it looked like the perfect necklace to fullfill his request. While my son is absolutely thrilled with this cross necklace, I am not. Although, for the price it is not horrible. I am a custom to the more expensive pieces I suppose. It came with a standard ball chain. It is long enough to fit around my son's head with it being clasped together. The cross was smaller than I anticipated and I could see some glue on the back side that probably squished out when the two pieces were put together. Like I said before, it's not the greatest quality necklace, but it's definitely not the worse either. Not bad for the price paid.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"Really like these socks! But, as i was putting on my pair this morning noticed a hole...these are brand new and Its disappointing to already have a hole in a pair,overall they are good though..."
3.0,It‚Äôs cute but it‚Äôs waaaaay too big
3.0,price is a bit high
3.0,I‚Äôm going to give this a 50-50 review I absolutely loved the high waisted bottoms. Bought medium bots fit perfect (gave kinda thong look) however the top even though I‚Äôm only about a 36C squished my bust into like a size a sometimes I wish you could pick and choose top and bottom sizes
3.0,I like them. There was one that would it go on the watch but the rest worked. They are okay for the price.
3.0,Tie lace broke the first week of wear. These are for kids; laces should be stronger. I sewed it back on.
3.0,"Reviewed by spouse:<br /><br />Cute tshirt, but extremely small. This is the large with my hand next to it. I could not even get it on to take a picture. Sadly, I don‚Äôt even think the extra large would‚Äôve been big enough."
3.0,"This is definitely a ‚Äúcostume‚Äù piece, more to be worn for Halloween or other themed parties.<br /><br />The pendant is HUGE, so it isn‚Äôt really that pretty. The spinner is a nice touch, and could add flair to a costume.<br /><br />The chain is really the nicest part of it.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, if used as a costume decoration ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a bad value."
3.0,"Bust is very small. I ordered a large, it fit everywhere else but I am a C-cup and could not get it buttoned."
3.0,Bought my usual size of small for my 34DD chest. Everything fit good except my girls. There is no stretch so they were strained.
3.0,"the silver belt is very nice quality but it's not reversible, very expensive for just one side I ordered it because I wanted both colors"
3.0,A little light weight but not that bad.
3.0,"They would have been great if they'd fit correctly. I found them too tight from the top of the toe box to the sole. Very cute, though."
3.0,"Dress is cute. Thin rayon type material. I ordered a size up and fit great but if you have a mid section this dress will highlight that with the way it is made. I got compliments on this dress. I wasn't sure if I liked the dress at first because of material. If in sunlight, kinda see through so I'm taking my to add a liner."
3.0,"Looks cool but cheaply made. Came missing one of the tassels with the end of the elastic all frayed, thankfully I had a small safety pin on hand to fashion it in place. Will do for the price & for halloween."
3.0,"Simple, comfortable design for wearing around the house, not sheer, but runs about a size too small."
3.0,One band fit perfit the second band had irregularities that made it impossible to get on without so shaving down.
3.0,Its a size smaller then you it says
3.0,"I can't wait to wear this suit. The red is beautiful however I was missing a bra pad. One side was in but not the other.<br /><br />Large, 36 B at 160 lbs"
3.0,"Cute presentation with nice assortment of princess gear!  Crown pieces snapped off quickly, the gems broke off the shoes on the first wear (hot glue did not fix them), and the gems were falling off of the rings within a week (gems were able to be glued back on).  NOT safe for little ones who still put things in their mouths!"
3.0,"The size was not an issue in this product but the both fabric used are a bit thin and the ruffle at the front does not fall as nicely as the picture. However I'm not totally unhappy with the purchase, I still use the top."
3.0,"It‚Äôs exactly what it looks like in the picture, and I love the way it fits. My only downfall with this product is it had so many loose strings, and I had to go back and re sew a few areas. Shouldn‚Äôt have to do that with something brand new"
3.0,Pretty. Ordered a 2X. I usually wear a med/large. Definitely order up like I did. Matched my bathing suit perfectly.
3.0,Works ok; not quite perfect
3.0,Es muy delgada la tela<br />No es como yo lo esperaba
3.0,Perfect fit. Needed for daughter preschool uniform requirements. She likes the shoe and it fits her well. I let her wear it around the house and she jumped and stomped and played in them. Velcro kept coming aloose. Im gonna figure out a solution to fix this issue  (perhaps simply buy stronger velcro). I gave it 3 stars bc of that issue. Otherwise I would give it 5.
3.0,"This dress is cute yes, but the back literally shows my butt. it was way toooooooo short in the back."
3.0,"It was not magnetic at all, but it still a really cute & simple gift for any occasion."
3.0,"Too big,all over"
3.0,Ehh if I was in the store I prob would have not purchased this item. Does not fit as expected. Hopefully this wont end up just sitting in my closet.
3.0,"I purchased the Lake Blue, Medium. This is perfect for something to throw on during the very hot Texas summers when you don't really wanna get dressed! The robe looks kind of green in my photo, but it really is the same color as the product picture, very pretty light blue. I'm 5'2, 140lbs, and it fits just like I wanted. The cotton is also very soft! I definitely see myself buying another one.<br /><br />AMENDMENT: You absolutely CANNOT dry this robe in the dryer! i Not only did it shrink a lot (from just above the knee to right below my butt cheek) but it is incredibly wrinkly. If this didn't happen, i would still give 5 stars."
3.0,"After 2 wears they already look like they're starting to get fuzzy and may tear, but they're exactly what I wanted in terms of functionality and fit"
3.0,Not as long as pictured. Shrunk slightly in wash. Arms snug.
3.0,A bit big in the cuff. But the quality is good
3.0,"Paint starting chipping off after a month, pretty bummed about this."
3.0,I like these shorts a lot but prefer to give 3 1/2 stars instead of four. I noticed near the back side the stitching looks good but when you hold them up to the light I can see the fabric has some pinholes or something. I don't know if it's just a defect or not but suggest you check your shorts if you're planning on wearing colored undies.
3.0,"Nice looking necklace, but the studs look cheap. Did not tarnish, seems well built."
3.0,Women's width which was hard to guage from the poor description in the site.
3.0,Definitely order 1-2 sizes up. It‚Äôs wayyy too small and the ties are in and odd spot for people with larger chests
3.0,A liitle tight
3.0,Really thin & the skull one is a very diporportionate not even lining up correctly on the face. Stitching is good though I'll give them that & not linty.
3.0,The straps are very thin and it had a terrible smell (like gasoline) for weeks.
3.0,I want to love this harem pant. I ordered a size small and they are incredibly long .  The pant legs slip onto the foot when walking - not very practical for leaving the house.
3.0,This dress was very pretty but fit rather small. The chest opening was split pretty deep. I am a bit modest and for a mom it showed a little too much.
3.0,Large sizing. Rough sewing edges. Although it's technically lined... It's VERY see through. Elastic is secure though. True white color.
3.0,"I would only wear it around home, where no one would see me, lol.  It's comfortable but not as attractive as the photos.  The site makes it look like a very fashion forward and stylish fit.  It's not flattering on any body type.  But the fabric really is soft and it's really nice to lounge around in.  The spot on the sleeve where it goes from 'blousy' to 'skinny' arm is really awkward. Awkward looking and awkward feeling on your arm."
3.0,Great item. A little bummed to have paid $7 and it has a $1 manufacturers tag on it.
3.0,"Nice glasses, although the material feels cheep and flimsy.  I'm afraid they won't last long.  The tint on the glasses is kind of weird too.  But overall they are nice for the price."
3.0,They looks nice but theyre super light and fragile. One bead was broken upon arrival
3.0,Material felt very cheap and sizing runs large
3.0,This dress is cute and I love that it has pockets but the medium is still quite big. It looks cuter with a belt added to it. Overall I am happy with the dress.
3.0,"Nice necklace.  For the price I didn‚Äôt expect high quality, but it arrived with a broken chain.  I returned rather than replaced because if it breaks this easily, I don‚Äôt want to give it to my kid for her birthday since I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt last long if not treated delicately."
3.0,"I bought the bigger one.  This is a cool product, but would only fit someone with VERY small wrists."
3.0,Longer than i expected
3.0,"Good fabric and nice printing, I'm a large now and this blouse/tunic is too big, of course is the intended look but anyway I think I could had order a medium and it would had for better"
3.0,The lobster clasp and chain turned to an odd orange color after wearing once.  The rest of the bracelet is beautiful but it looks too cheap to ever wear again. So sad because it is very pretty.
3.0,Impossible.
3.0,"Sizes ran smaller than I had expected. I could get them on, but it was uncomfortable. They are very soft and warm tho so I will give them that."
3.0,Fine product in terms of quality...delivered without hassle.  Just was hoping it aligned better with facial features.  Nostrils set too high (right under wearer's eyes) so it looks bizarre.  I'm sure it's fine from a functional standpoint.
3.0,It‚Äôs ok the sides of the tail need to come forward to cover the sides of your face and needs to be longer in the back to cover my neck
3.0,It's very pretty but it's supposed to be a little girl's bracelet and it's way too big for my 10 year old daughter. She wintered be able to wear it for a year or more.
3.0,my teen love it. it her first complete jewelry.
3.0,Heavier than expected.
3.0,This are not for people with a larger head. But they fit my thirteen year old very well. Sigh.
3.0,"They are beautiful shoes, but much too wide - my foot twists and slides - I don't know what I'm going to do about them.....can't wear them for very long."
3.0,Mine seas well made (without the elastic adjusters) but it ran big so it bunches badly and doesn‚Äôt sit right. Not sure how I‚Äôm gonna fix it
3.0,Not what I expected.. nothing in product information about how thin these scarves are..
3.0,I love the color and the design but it really fits funny. Tight on the top and way to long and big on the bottom. Will have to bring it in to get fixed but I was not very impressed with it. I would not but again.
3.0,These pj‚Äôs fit well and are comfortable. They wash pretty well but the top has pills after the first wash.
3.0,It's a fair knock off
3.0,"I really didn't care a lot for this particular color bathing suit, it look nothing like the picture. Little roomy in the strap area. I really don't like how the strap come loose all the time. Very displeased.  I don't recommend in that color. The material is not bad."
3.0,"The pendant itself is terrific, but the cord of the necklace is too small for even the head of a child."
3.0,"Other than receiving the wrong color & it's impossible to set the time/date,its cool"
3.0,I gave this dress 3 stars because it honestly wasn‚Äôt bad quality for the money but I‚Äôm not the right girl for this dress. I‚Äôm pretty  comfortable  With myself and I have a couple body con dresses I look really nice in. But this was SO revealing. It shows literally everything! No where to hide in this dress. At the same time. It‚Äôs very long on me. Like past my knees so I felt to covered up and to on display at the same time if that makes sense? It overall was very odd on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù7 127 lbs I ordered a small
3.0,"It does not go down as far as it shows in the picture and the sleeves are not as long The links come off very easily and it gets rusty After a few days, I would not recommend this product and you can find for a better price and quality all the other items"
3.0,"nice yellow lenses glasses for the price, enhance your vision in overcast conditions, but the pair that I received are on polarized. Very lightweight and comfortable!"
3.0,"These are fine, would be ideal pajama or lounge pants. Unfortunately the pair I received were sewn in a lopsided manner so the drawstring is actually on the side. It‚Äôs rather bizarre. I would also recommend sizing down unless you like your clothes super baggy."
3.0,"Both lens on the tortoise pair popping out, and sits on my face crooked (one side it up higher than the other, and the other side if pushed back really far). Probably won‚Äôt be wearing them.<br />The black pair is super cute. Nothing wrong with them, will for sure be wearing them."
3.0,While I like it. It's not the same waxed leather as the wallet. Which was disappointing.
3.0,Would have given four stars but the bottom of the shoes are a little thin so I'm going to have to buy inserts to wear them. Other than that and the zipper sticking some they are great. I want another pair in brown instead of black.
3.0,"This is a really puffy coat. I ordered according to the size chart, size Lrg. 5‚Äô4 165lb.  I look huge in it, there‚Äôs no shape,  probably would look better on someone who‚Äôs tall and slender. 100% polyester soft shell. Shepa ( not the really soft kind) lines the hood and the lapel. The inside is NOT down filled. Plastic zipper with metal pulls works good with an option to button. I do not feel this coat is worth $80."
3.0,"It's fine for what it is. I would not buy tho and even would like a refund. Does not come with pocket for filters as stated. Fits decent but not tight enough to work in without putting over ears, which is uncomfortable. Much better products out there."
3.0,"These run small and narrow. Very pretty otherwise, too bad we had to return."
3.0,Umbrella for children or solitary.<br />Quality like any umbrella made in China
3.0,I don't think it's adequate to just order 1 size up.  This was very small.  I ordered a size XL for my XL son and it wouldn't fit him or my L son.  I still kept it for a much smaller person because the style is ok and the color works.  It is an ok product but not great.
3.0,Very pretty. Runs smaller than expected.
3.0,For being a large by 9 year old daughter had a problem fitting her head. The tie tales were not long enough.
3.0,bie
3.0,I ordered a small and the skirt fit a lil loose but the top showed to much side boobs. The material is soft and the blue is a pretty color
3.0,"When I‚Äôm not in the office, I live in compression clothes and such, due to a chronic spine condition. I‚Äôve tried this brand, along with 4-6 others. While these fit well (tall people included!), they pill/fray quickly along the ‚Äúinner thigh panels‚Äù. I wash all of these pants with TLC  in order to make them last comment but in this case? This brand still wore out quickly. I ended up buying one pair of these and month, and rotating out a worn out pair each month.  Considering I do not work out beyond yoga, this seems unreasonable. None  of the other brands I tried wore out so quickly. Save your money and keep looking."
3.0,I am happy with the next day service. I bought the glasses to lower glare while night driving as the new brighter headlights create more glare for me. The glasses do lower the glare.  The clip on glasses do help reduce glare and are good quality. I only received one amber clip on. I am not unhappy with the purchase I just thought the advertisement should not say two pack.
3.0,"Quick delivery, Nice leather FOB. Biggest problem my Jeep Wrangler key along with one house key does Not fit on the ring. Very disappointing. I love the key ring idea - just wish the diameter was smaallergy so all of my keys fit. Just put the leather FOB on my existing key ring."
3.0,"These glasses are hard and unyielding, but at their price, I wasn't expecting much.  The hearts were larger than I anticipated, but the shades were actually much better than I hoped for - they truly shade out the sun!<br /><br />Due to how unyielding they are, one of the arms broke out of its hinge, but I've been able to slide it back into place and glue it with minimal issues.<br /><br />I get compliments everywhere I wear these glasses."
3.0,"Cute dress, but, too small. I gave it to my daughter!"
3.0,Tighter than expected but I was wearing under garments. Yellow is a little strange color...sort of orange-yellow.
3.0,Very nice quality but does not tighten well around the nose area
3.0,Looks a little cheap. I'd go with a different design if I were you. Looks like a plain chain.
3.0,the product is exactly as it looks in the picture- only problem is the shiny part/ color chips off very easily<br />you can probably wear it once
3.0,"I would have loved these but I don't like the way part the leg opening is stitched together at the bottom; restricts the free flowing movement I like.  I have seen this style on another woman, they did look nice on her, just not for me."
3.0,But my daughter loves it
3.0,"Light on watch, battery still working for 2 months now but handles broke 1st day of opening"
3.0,"haven't really worn it, swimming in it"
3.0,There is no mustache. It is all long like the beard...there is a cut out in back for your mouth. The elastic that holds it on is kind of wide. This would be fine for theater but dont expect to fool any kids. The hat also runs small...
3.0,"The recomended size for this product is inaccurate. I wore one of the tops today and i had issues keeping the shirt pulled down and from riding 1/2 the way up my torso wile walking as well as it's supposed to be a compression top but my personal opinion is that it's quite the opposite of a compression, shaping top. I would recommend buying 1-2 sizes larger than recommend true fit size and understand that the product IS NOT ACCURATELY ADVERTISED. It's really just a really cute designed regular tang-top and nothing more. I was honestly disappointed when i unwrapped the package and even more disappointed when i tried to wear the top out for the walk."
3.0,"I wanted to like this top more than I do, but it isn‚Äôt as flattering on as I‚Äôd like it to be. The top-shoulder part no matter how I fiddle with it won‚Äôt lie right‚Äîwhether I put it off shoulder or not.<br /><br />However, with the exception of that, it has a flattering fit‚Äînot too tight but fitted nicely to my body.<br /><br />The color is not exactly red but sort of a brick-red color.<br /><br />This top is super soft, and that‚Äôs a plus.<br /><br />I‚Äôm hoping it will hold up with washings, and I think hanging it to dry will prolong its life and shape.<br /><br />Since the shoulder part is vexing me, I‚Äôll likely just wear this when I am going to wear a jacket over it, or around the house, or maybe running quick errands.<br /><br />Too bad, since otherwise I really like how soft it is and flattering a fit other than the shoulder/top part."
3.0,I like the design and color but not the handles.  They are very stiff.  Perhaps if I hand wash the handles they will be OK.
3.0,Too small and when I got the medium it fit fine but color was no longer white it was cream
3.0,I love how it look on me and how it feels but was upset with the delay delivery
3.0,A bit smaller than i thought but i think i will like it anyway.
3.0,According to my measurements I ordered xl size. It's just huge
3.0,[[VIDEOID:fad3cbef96d74dc83229a8c5071bad54]] Loved the outfit i really could have sized down but then the bra wouldn‚Äôt have fit and it was still kinda small
3.0,The plastic posts bend and break easily.
3.0,Thought it was straight silver
3.0,"Run small , tight around the toes ."
3.0,"Weird fit, sent it back."
3.0,"I have a large bust, but I still don't fill in the top of this dress because of the way it is designed, so I will need to purchase a padded bra and hope that does the trick. It is also about 6 inches too long, so I will need to have it hemmed or use hemming tape on it. However, it is well constructed and shipping didn't take as long as I expected with the quarantine delays."
3.0,It's cute but the material is not great. It also makes my top look a little odd. Not great for anything over a c cup in my opinion
3.0,"I usually wear a L/ XL if I want it loose I ordered a 2XL and it fits like a large, a tad loose.  The color is ORANGE, not a pinky orange.  The quality is ok not horrible but not great.  I think it's the sublimation quality I just don't like.  I love love the design, I wish I could get just the design to make my own"
3.0,"I returned this pair of shoes.  It felt like a padded spandex sock.  I sized up and it was too large so you should order the right size to avoid your child from tripping over their own feet!  Also, Amazon only reimburses up to $3.99 for return shipping of this item."
3.0,Husband likes these lenses since they are polarized. Wasn't excepting them to have a brown tint so that is the only reason why I gave them 3 stars. They fit well in costa sunglasses.
3.0,Great print. Too bad the shirt doesn't fit right.
3.0,"Love the colors, but I was swimming in it!"
3.0,Kinda feels cheap. Lace isn't high quality. Looks more like lingerie then a cover up.
3.0,"I knew these earrings would be small, which is fine, but they are so tiny , that when you look at them, you can't tell what they are unless you are very close. they are pretty though, and the workmanship, is good quality, would be lovely on a young girl.I am going to give them to my grandaughter."
3.0,I am a 36 waist 6ft 2 at 210 lbs. I got the large and the waist fit well but the bands around the legs were very tight. Exchanged for the XL and the waist was a little bigger but still fit well and the legs were still tight but not as much as the large. Not sure I can get past the circulation getting cut off to my legs.
3.0,"I ordered a size medium, but they don‚Äôt all fit the same."
3.0,"Got these for my daughter to wear next year to disney. Got the size up, she is easy to buy for ahead of time. These shirts fit her now üòí<br />And the pictures on them are a bit rough. They don't ""move"" with the shirt. Was hoping after washing them it would be better, but nope. Maybe after a few washes and wear."
3.0,Adorable but we couldn't get the head to stay up. The fan wasn't powerful enough.
3.0,It's a cute bracelet and the beads are lovely.  The bracelet is very small even when expanded in full.  I am not a large woman and my hands are of average size.  Slipping it over my hand to get onto my wrist took some work in order to not break the cord.  I won't wear it very often because of this one issue.
3.0,If you are busty not the best look
3.0,The outer parts are good except few scratches around the zipper but the inner septum  material is very bad
3.0,Very small had to rip the fluff ball off the top but now its just a basic f u beanie and i love it i wear it everyday
3.0,"This look great on the website and would be a better bracelet if the clasp were better, easier to connect.  You can't put the bracelet on alone."
3.0,"I normally wear a size small but, got this in a medium. It just fit me with little room for shrinkage. The fabric is really thin and cheap. Im sure it will shrink if you put it in a dryer. I expected it to be more over sized and thicker t-shirt fabric."
3.0,about 6-7 of the gold studs was either off are misissing and bend up in package
3.0,Fleece lining is only for the body but not sleeves.
3.0,"Cute glasses, look and feel expensive. I am more into the oversized look, I feel that these ran on the smaller side. I did return them."
3.0,"a bit large.  Which is better than too tight.  What will keep me from buying more is the length.  The regular is around a 30&#34; so I would not expect it to need to be rolled up 2 inches.  I HATE hemming things.  I wanted the Short, which has a 29 inch inseam, but they seem to be unavailable just about everywhere.  I did find a pair of brown ones elsewhere, and they fit perfectly.  I'd buy the short in black or blue.  For now, though, this &#34;Short-Wide&#34; will give the Avery's a bye."
3.0,"Very nice material, but I returned it because I didn't like how high the neckline was - it rode up above my collarbone within a minute of wearing it. The neckline doesn't lay nicely but rather ripples a bit, too."
3.0,"After much hesitation, I am returning this bag.  It is the exact size and good quality I expected.  I did not expect that the &#34;gold foil&#34; accents would be so bright.  They are loud!  I would have kept this bag if the gold had been matte.  I have 2 other Patricia Nash bags that are excellent, I'll still be shopping her inventory.<br />Simply Stunning Accessories did a nice job of packing.  There was a ribbon and a card addressed to me.  Nice touch!"
3.0,"Cute sport bra, but not as stretchy as expected,fit too snug"
3.0,It's a nice bag . I should've  paid better attention<br />To the measurements  because it's half the size I was expecting. The photo of it on a manican<br />Made it look larger than it is.
3.0,"I loved this pullover, except for the fact it does run on the small side."
3.0,I did not like how the bottom is tight
3.0,The straps are too long but everything else on this fits great
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, but will go well with mermaid costume."
3.0,I liked the fabric but my toddler couldn't put his feet into boots! They are way too narrow. The product team must know about that. I had to return them.
3.0,The piece broke off why I was trying to open it. The bag is beautiful.
3.0,"I love the design. When I first ordered the necklace the chain was broken. However, the return went very well. The metal does rust easily though."
3.0,"True to size, stretch denim, jumpsuit is not bad, it is just not what I was looking for.<br />The buttons on the front look kind of weird."
3.0,The bee was badly stamped on watch.
3.0,Like the material but the color is nowhere near rose (more peach than anything).
3.0,"The product is exactly as pictured. They came in super fast & in a nice microfiber pouch! Very pretty & as described, but was too long for my nostril. They may work for others, just not for me."
3.0,"dress was ok, but expected a better material"
3.0,The green and pink floral design is so unique looking and the colors are gorgeous together. Looks just like the picture. The fabric itself was really weird. Felt like a cross between like old school polyester uniform and swimsuit material‚Ä¶ a bit of a sheen to it. Not even sure how to describe it really. The print was so pretty I debated just looking past that weird material‚Ä¶ but finally decided to return it.
3.0,"I could have gone up a size, they fit but are a little snug, also the outer layer is noisy makes a pretty loud swooshing sound when you walk. I never thought sound could be a problem when ordering clothes but it does bother me üòÖ"
3.0,"This product was OK, but the 'S' hook broke off so I can no longer hand this item. Plus things inside don't seem to stand up on their own."
3.0,"material was tight, not how it needed to be and when put on shiny overlay began falling apart from material"
3.0,a bit tight in front
3.0,"I like the rose Gold, but wish the color was brighter."
3.0,"Based on the reviews the size runs small so I decided to order a medium. Unfortunately, when I got it it was a tad too big. Not unwearable, but it would have fit sooo much better had I taken a small. I'm 5&#34;7 appx. 127 lbs. Apart from that it looks like the pic, nice design and offers nice coverage for the conservative gal while still being stylish."
3.0,"Mostly as pictured, color more beige than I expected. I‚Äôll be using it but it‚Äôs not the quality I expected even if it‚Äôs not named brand. Last photo no flash."
3.0,Just not a quality flip flop. Disappointed.
3.0,"It's pretty and unique, but even though the bar is made of stainless steel, the other metal is not. So it made my super sensitive skin itchy after a few days."
3.0,"I ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear, and it fits like my normal size would.  Which means that the one in MY size would have been two sizes too small.  Not to be a Grinch here, but the sizing is way off.  Other than that, the shirt was lovely, and looks good."
3.0,I love them! I get a lot of comments
3.0,Ok shades just durable
3.0,"Interesting print and design, but actual printing quality isn't as nice as I would like.  The fabric is a bit stiff and scratchy too, similar to a burlap.  For the price, it is a decent purchase."
3.0,These earrings are really cute but they did not last at all...they lasted all of one week.  The butterflies fell off the hooks.
3.0,Cute sixteen year old type neckless
3.0,"They are okay, was expecting more of of them. Pretty lose"
3.0,It is too small for xlarge size . Dress is nice though
3.0,It seemed on the cheap side of being made.  Thin material.
3.0,"I ordered the #3 which states it is 10.6"" it actually measures from collar to the end of the bias, trim, to be 11.25"". The chest area fit as expected. The material is a nice, soft and stretchy. The seams are well stitched. I will give it to my mothers dog."
3.0,"Very comfortable for working out, would like more color choice"
3.0,"Nice, but smaller than we wanted."
3.0,I thought the quality of the leather was nice but the straps were definitely too short to put on your shoulders.
3.0,Wish it was a little bigger it‚Äôs a little tighter than I thought it would be. But I waited two months to arrive I couldn‚Äôt wait to wear it. It what I wanted and soft.
3.0,"It's OK, but very conservative and not feminine enough for me.  The lace front helps a little, but I exchanged it for something more lacey and feminine."
3.0,A good value for light duty use.<br />Nice fit and looks.  My shoe lasted 6 months daily use in light construction work.
3.0,This runs super short and tight.  Size up.  Maybe size up twice.
3.0,It is great if you do not have a big junk (if you know what I mean) It is really comfortable but it is hard when you try to squeeze everything in there.
3.0,"Meh, looks cheap. Great for costume pieces"
3.0,"Nice fabric, color etc. That being said, my daughter is a very petite 12 yr old and this 12-14 is WAY to small. She weighs under 100lbs."
3.0,I love the necklace but my letter L is already starting to tarnish‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
3.0,This material is a little thinner than I'd hoped. It shows every bump/vpl/panty shade.
3.0,"Like:<br />-Anime print<br />-QUICK ship<br /><br />Dislike:<br />-fit loose<br />-top fit better than bottom, bottom would fall off if not held.<br /><br />Will exchange for smaller suit. Hopefully fits better."
3.0,They are longer than I thought. It would be nice to have some with 28-29 inch inseam.
3.0,"I've this watch... Unfortunately, I fell and it didn't protect my watch. The top left side shattered. Now the touch screen doesn't work and to repair will cost $300. Comfortable however... if you're looking for screen protection this is not the one for you."
3.0,Gorgeous color & decent leather
3.0,"cute, but way too big"
3.0,"I love the color and the quote, but fits weird. Neck is too tight, sleeved a little short."
3.0,"The material is nicer than any other brand of short like this on Amazon. However, this short gave me a ‚Äúbutt in the front‚Äù look because of their higher waist cut and gathering at waistband."
3.0,These are tiny.
3.0,"I needed them because my ears always break out due to cheap earrings. While they don't make my ears irritated, they are quite cheap and break easily. I have broken three little black ones already by just wearing them in my ear, they serve their purpose, but not the best quality."
3.0,Was looking more for an Aviator look on frames but when I received them they where more oval shaped it was just different not my taste.
3.0,"I was expecting something a little more elegant like the picture, I got a 12-18 months and it's really short. Not really as picture, quality is not that elegant."
3.0,Black bands came off too easy i would recommend super glueing the bands in place before wearing (WAIT UNTILL THE GLUE DRYS FIRST BEFORE WEARING)
3.0,"Make sure you look at the sizes, the 8mm are super small. I‚Äôm not sure they will fit my ear."
3.0,Nose pads too far down on my cheeks; not on my nose at all.
3.0,they do reduce glare a *little*. I was expecting more. The reduction of glare is not really enough to make a difference. I have them in the car but i have been night-driving without them
3.0,"Glad I ordered XL, the shirts are quite small. I would definitely recommend going up a size."
3.0,Cool mask but very flimsy
3.0,I wear a 42R. But i lift weights so it‚Äôs a little tight. But i can still wear it. Not the best material. But if you‚Äôre looking for a cheap jacket that looks stylish go for it.
3.0,"It‚Äôs quite a deep hat, I feel like it sits too high. The stone washed color is really nice but slightly purple. Not sure I would buy it again but i‚Äôll wear since I have it."
3.0,*I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review *<br />I got this as a gift for my mom. She loved it but I was expecting a little better quality. The area that holds the purple stones seems clunky.
3.0,"This product was not as advertised.  They were supposed to be ""mid-calf"" but they barely come aboe the ankle.  Most important, they are not cotton.  They contain a good deal of spandex and otherwise they are some type of synthetic - probably nylon and/or polyester - in spite of the label stating ""100% cotton"", which is clearly not the case.  Finally, the website itself was glitchy because when I put the item into my cart they were called ""6 pair mid-calf"" but when I clicked on the link from my cart back to the item, it said something like ""2 to 5 pair ankle socks"" or some such.  Only 5 pairs arrived, not six.  I am returning them since I wanted cotton socks, not synthetic."
3.0,"It‚Äôs a cute, simple dress. Made of a more t-shirty and stretchy material than I thought. The front baffled me since the neckline was wide open and there‚Äôs all these buttons but no button holes to close the neckline up! It is slim-fit, I typically where a medium and the large was a bit too form-fitting"
3.0,It was very cute. Way too tight on the arms. Had to return it
3.0,Letters fell off chest within one week. But otherwise nice little rain jacket for running or hiking. Dont see it lasting too long but you get what you pay for. If you put a lot of wear-and-tear on a light jacket this could be a good non-expensive option to use and replace every so often
3.0,"The sandal has enough cushion to add comfort and support. I deducted two stars for 1. It is for narrow feet, in its description the width wasn‚Äôt mentioned as I have wide feet, 2. the label was cheaply applied on because it didn‚Äôt stick so I took it off then removed the adhesive with rubbing alcohol. Hopefully the adhesive used for the shoe isn‚Äôt the same."
3.0,No really worth buying it's really stiff and not enough holes to fix someone with a small wrist the price was to high
3.0,It's a great case for the price but -- only wish they had included the screws to hang it  .
3.0,Bracelet is not very heavy nor does it look sturdy. Added charms to it and it has held up so far. Does look dainty if this what you are looking for but weight is light
3.0,"I love the style and the color and the way it's made.  It doesn't sit very far down on my head because it's on the &#34;shallow&#34; side, so if I'm out in the wind, I doubt it stays on.  However, it's a very nice hat!!!!  Very pretty!"
3.0,"The sizing runs smaller than the measurements provided in the sizing chart.  I am especially noting the bust measurement as it seems to be smaller by about an inch to an inch and a half. I ordered the navy and the true color of the garment I received is paler, but close enough. The fabric is light and should do well for the summer months ahead."
3.0,"Great product, BUT they are extremely large sizing is not correct."
3.0,"Ok, but not a good thing to wear for too long. I would not recommend."
3.0,Runs a little small. But comfortable!
3.0,"Not the new bands fault but do not be surprised if you can not get the old screws out.  Got the first one out no problem but the next three not so lucky.  Either the head of the screw was already stripped or the little includes tool stripped the head.  Either way the old band was not coming off the watch.  So, since it was my loop that had broken, I took the loop off the new band and slid it on the old band.  Watch back in operation.  Kind of expensive for a small silicone loop but the watch is functional."
3.0,"They come small!  Order a size bigger!  I ordered an 8, and I wear a size 7.  Thank goodness I did that, because they still barely fit!"
3.0,"Loved this top! Got tons of compliments on it, however one wash and the lettering faded A LOT!"
3.0,The color of the wood is darker than the picture
3.0,Casually I didn't like the pocket to open
3.0,great item but its crazy small. person whom I bought it for is regular size and this was wayy to small
3.0,not as white or lustery as my baby akoya ones.
3.0,seam turns up in wash.
3.0,"Bonus- the fit is super flattering. The color is beautiful. The three star review is because the top of the burgundy ombr√© dress is too sheer. Nude colored bra doesn‚Äôt even help. And the color is off enough that I don‚Äôt know if I can find something to go over the top easily. I‚Äôm hopeful, because it is really pretty."
3.0,"Fits great, definitely a slim fit (bought large, and I'm 5'7""/ 190lbs) sits just below pants line and tapers on the sides. So soft!!!!<br />Downside, it's thinner than expected added with my olive toned complexion and you can DEFINITELY see my nipples and tattoos through it. Definitely needs an undershirt in public, or pasties"
3.0,It‚Äôs the fabric. So soft like a diaper. Now I‚Äôm afraid to wash it causing shrinkage. Since it wasn‚Äôt that expensive I‚Äôll keep it. However I won‚Äôt order another.
3.0,The band is awesome. I wish the price wasn't so expensive.
3.0,"I very carefully read the dimensions provided for this item as i had specific intentions for this bag.  Unfortunately, i cannot use it for what i wanted as bag is smaller than described.  However, the outside seems study and the cats are adorable.  The lining doesn't seem to be the kind of fabric that will hold up well over time, sadly, but otherwise it's okay."
3.0,Would be cute but it's baggy on me and it's supposed to be fitted.
3.0,A little tight even though I got my size. Should probably go a size up. Other than that I like it. It feels good against your skin. Keeps everything in place and not jiggly around. I like the fact it's high waisted so it hides my stomach while working out.
3.0,"When I got this my much desired key chain 3weeks ago, I fell absolutely in love with it.<br />The logo of my car brand is in gold on my car key.It went well with the chain, and the rottie looked so adorable;  everything was so nice.<br />But now the rottie is turning white and the gold of the chain is fading. All in 3 weeks!<br />White rottie?!!! Grrrrr..."
3.0,"Socks fit fine, but they have weird designs and color combinations on them.  Hard to match to my son's outfits."
3.0,The shape of the dress it‚Äôs cute but the fabric is thin and looks cheap. Overall when you are fully dressed it‚Äôs fine. But I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again
3.0,"The lining on the skirt is bright yellow, which makes it completely different than picture shown. The tones in the image are minty cool, while in real life it's the opposite. The flowers are also pink, not purple.<br /><br />If I had been going for that color palette, that would be one thing. The skirt itself is pretty and fits well. Just not at all as pictured. Such a bummer!"
3.0,"It feels very nice, but it‚Äôs not tummy control. Another thing that really bothered me is that is very see through when you do squats, so I can only wear with long tops/t shirts"
3.0,The hat is very cute and lightweight. After washing I realized it may be too lightweight because the cap part now flops down and does a poor job.
3.0,"For the money, fifty dollars, this is okay quality. There appear to be many watches of equal quality that are cheaper.  I appreciate quality in manufacturing, so I opted for this one hoping the quality would be better. It came with a sticker-note inside the cover instructing user not to shut the cover without depressing the release, so as not to wear out the pin in the clasp.  One would hope for better quality than that note indicates.  It's an overpriced watch of so-so quality. I treated it rough and, indeed, the cover did not last."
3.0,Nice appearance- good quality- too long for my earlobes.  Could have been shorter.
3.0,"My mistake ,I guess must be wrongly estimated sized."
3.0,Not too grand...it will suit people who likes tiny jewelery
3.0,"When we received , it‚Äôs dirty, and can‚Äôt clean"
3.0,The only complaint I have with these is the back clasp to the pins. They are very flimsy and don't hold into place very well. More for display which isn't why I purchased.
3.0,The dress is beautiful; however the flowers fell off after the second wash
3.0,"You get what you pay for so I can't be too upset that this product pulls across my bust area. It's not awful but I prefer it to be a bit baggier as the picture shows. So anybody above a C-cup, beware that your sweater will pull. The quality is okay but the sleeves are tight so pushing them up isn't really an option. I do like the colors and washing it without having to send it to the dry cleaner but if I had the option to purchase this again, I would turn it down."
3.0,"I'm happy with the look of the item, but the necklace chain and attachment are very poor quality. If it wasn't for the price, it would have gotten two stars. If you're handy with jewelry you can easily replace the back and make it sturdy. If not, don't get the item as it will likely break the first time you wear it. In my case , I was able to repair it , easily. But, it broke while putting it on. Love love love the lacework and the blue gem."
3.0,Satin lining inside shoe where kid rest the foot has came out in first 2 days of wearing the shoe .  Disappointed . But other than that it is super cute and lasting long from past 2 months . Iam liking it .My son has no complaints to wear .
3.0,Its ok. Fits the watch well. Removed 1 link and its a bit too big for my wrist. Remove 2 links and its cutting off circulation lol. Can't win.
3.0,"I originally purchased this product in Black, and the fabric was wonderful. I chose the gray pants when black was no longer available, and the fabric is much thinner and does not hang nicely. Black fabric is much better!!"
3.0,The bows are hot glued on. One fell off immediately
3.0,I liked this product except that it pushed my breasts together in the front in a way that I found unattractive.  Maybe I will try another size
3.0,"They look like kids' glasses. They are tiny and sit so high up, that it defeats the whole purposes. I wanted a low profile reading glasses that I can look over them. Definitely not what I wanted,"
3.0,I like the product but as of now 4 stars. When I get from travel I will provide an updated review
3.0,To small.  Maybe put chest size in the descriptions
3.0,"Really cute print, quality is good, but the onesie itself is rather small. I bought a 6 mo onesie thinking my 7 wk old would have room to grow but she fits it perfectly, and she weighs under 11lbs. Be sure to order 2 sizes up."
3.0,"This dress is looooong.  I am 5'6"", 130 lbs, and sorta long-legged and thin body type.  It comes down to the top of my knees.  Not flattering.  I thought with the extra small, the length would be mid thigh.  Nope.  But I love the pockets and the flow of the material. Maybe I'll hem it up.  The model in the photo must be 6 ft tall or at least 5'9 or 5'10""!"
3.0,"Because a man should own more than just one white dress shirt, I added this one to my collection... But:<br />Cons:<br />* Fits a tad big on me (15.5, 33/34, medium)<br />* Has no tags whatsoever, kinda fishy for my own like.<br />* Here comes the BIG one; the one I received wasn't WHITE. It was a light faded baby blue. When I returned it i placed a piece of another white shirt I purchased elsewhere (I tailor my own clothes so was able to send a cut out is said shirt) to show them what I was expecting the color to be.<br /><br />pros:<br />* 100% cotton<br />* Purchased from amazon so there where no hassles."
3.0,"Maybe misleading about the 2 pack and receive 1, uugh!"
3.0,"Like the fabric a lot . but runs small for the a 16-18 especially in the arms , disappointed about that  I have to return it ."
3.0,"Very pretty. Decent quality. Some bows don't match the headband, but they work together. I like that style. A lot of bang for your buck. However, they are huge. Way too big for my baby. Almost too big for my 3 yr old"
3.0,"really thin material and it smelled weird when got it,"
3.0,the glasses we received were not the shape pictured
3.0,Cute at for a kid or small adult.  Got the hat in time and it looks good... But an important part of the hat is missing.  The feather!
3.0,Earrings are beautiful.  Disappointed in how easy they bent when I tried to put the rubber backing on the post.
3.0,The points on the tips of the star are way too sharp and hurt.
3.0,"Didn't like, runs small, chintzy fabric"
3.0,"This is pretty Yes ........However after days of----- I put it in a bag with a cup of vinegar next to it to get rid of the mold/mildew; then in the sun for countless hours, then today I sprayed it with colloidal silver and I think it smells fine now..........whatever this seller or manufacturer is doing really<br />should be changed, the location, the storage ...........horrible allergens!"
3.0,I wish this dress came in petite sizes. The torso on this dress was too long for me (I'm 5 feet tall). I had also hoped the fabric would be a little softer; it seemed too stiff in my opinion. But I really like the look.
3.0,"Cute, but very small. Description should say that they are for &#34;teens&#34; as it does on the label. Cannot see the face very well when not in the correct light."
3.0,overall nice necklace. the chain is very very thin; ideally would use another chain. looks nice on.
3.0,Broke right after my son gave it to his dad
3.0,I like the screw back feature however  with each set there is one earing with a screw back and one with a screw on front. The ones with the screw on front require you to put the earring on from the opposite direction making it much harder to use.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress. It looked absolutely stunning on me but it arrived with a missing strap. I decided the asymmetrical look, while unintentional, still worked and wore the dress to the event anyhow and by the end of the evening another one of the straps had come off, making the whole thing unwearable."
3.0,The retractable cover comes off and had to be refastened and glued.
3.0,It looks cheesy and poorly made.
3.0,I love the color and fit of the leggings but the seams at the ankle is already frayed and starting to unravel Very sad might have to toss these ones and find something else.
3.0,I was looking for a pair of skintone/nude pantyhose. These were not it. They fit but when I put them on they looked very pale and I couldn't see my skin tone at all. I'm darker skinned and order the tone coffee. It looked more like a coffee with extra cream ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I can't say these are bad pantyhose. They just didn't fit my needs.
3.0,"Very cute, but wasn't centered,  took me a while to fix it. Also one part wouldn't lay flat on my nect no matter which way i put it."
3.0,These are just okay.  Really a little too large for my 6 year olds.  They constantly fall down their face and really do not work well for a face mask.  The material is too thin for a face mask in my opinion.  Some sneeze or cough particles will go through the thin material.<br />My girls have been using these more for neck scarves.
3.0,To much $$$$$$$$$$$$.
3.0,Description very confusing. The description said the band was silver and BLACK . It was 100% silver.
3.0,"So this popped up and my son and I both thought I should get it because it is &#34;me&#34; and it isn't very expensive.  Lesson learned: don't do that again.  It is ok, but I will need to do some adjusting because it does not hang as shown in the photo.  The chain and pendants are pretty, but the book pendant actually hangs about 25% behind the moon pendant.  And it doesn't glow, but that wasn't important to me anyway.  If you are looking for something high quality, keep looking."
3.0,cute but the deer on the front smelled real bad even after washing and drying it...I had to put peppermint oil on it to hide the smell
3.0,"So, I expected the hipsters to fit nicely around my hips, but I also expected them to sit comfortably on my backside.  I feel like I'm having to choose whether I want them to fit comfortably on my hips OR I want full coverage on my backside‚ÄîI'm not getting both. I thought that maybe the next size up would do the trick, but when I compared them to my well-worn hipsters, these are actually already a tad larger in the hips, so a larger size wouldn't help. I don't know, maybe it's just not my style, but I'm disappointed. I will say, on a positive note, that the fabric is heavenly and the colors are beautiful. Just need to make more styles that fit more body types."
3.0,Only negative is my cards fall out easily. Will be keeping it for now!
3.0,"They do give good arch support, but they are thicker than the insert that came with the shoes so it make my shoes feel really tight.."
3.0,Much lighter blue than expected
3.0,"Fit as expected, but the pattern was different (and less flattering) than in the product picture because of where the material was cut"
3.0,"The fabric used is really cute, but the waist hits really high.  So it‚Äôs unflattering on me."
3.0,There is absolutely 0 neck drape like shown in the picture. Its like wearing a compression sock on your throat
3.0,"This is amazingly comfortable. So soft! But the top is quite loose. I end up exposing myself. This isn't a problem because I only use is as pajamas and only my husband sees me in it. Maybe if you're a D or DD cup it would be fine. Also helps to keep the buttons buttoned. I bought a small, and I usually wear a size 2 or 4, depending on the brand. I'm usually a small petite."
3.0,"Cute. About 16/18 g. Ordered white. Returning because I got both the 4 and 5 mm so the stones don't match in size, thought that would match."
3.0,I love the shape and the design. I just didn't realize how small they were and have a little problem trying to put them on
3.0,It is attractive and stylish.....Just doesn't hold time. It's sporadic. I have had to adjust to correct time once I start to wear..Not good.
3.0,"I just received my wrap, and it's cute, but not as pictured on Amazon.  The photo shows an ivory colored fringe at the bottom, but the one I received has green.  I'm not a big fan of green, so may return it."
3.0,Cute bag but a little too big for my taste
3.0,Loved the bracelet for a guy BUT breaks very easily - now broken and i cannot return it
3.0,Good quality but short in the crotch area.
3.0,"Really like the details of the shirt. Soft, and looks just like the photo. They run SMALL. I ordered an XL it fits like a med/large. I like T-shirts to be roomy and have a comfy fit. I usually wear a medium or large in tops. My D size bust fits in the extra large with not a lot of room to spare. Order a size or two up and you'll be fine."
3.0,Sheer & comfortable but don't stay up more than 3 hours
3.0,"Cute, but I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it!"
3.0,"Shrinks after first wash.  So the space as far as size remains the same but the length of the torso and sleeves shrink.  So if you are a large, you will fit but depending on your height and reach not so much.  Don't wash it lol"
3.0,It had a nasty smell and was not long at all like in the picture.<br />Was not very satisfied with this purchase at all.
3.0,"Loved the shirt when it arrived. It fit perfectly and the colors were lovely.<br />Unfortunately, one washing in cold water, cold water rinse, with small amount of Tide and dried on delicate and it looks like a t-shirts I bought and wore last summer, not awful, but no longer beautiful, slightly faded and an inch shorter.<br />I will wear it around the house,  it I am disappointed and won‚Äôt buy another."
3.0,"I was so excited about receiving these pants because I liked the style. But let me tell you, it is NOT tall girl friendly and I‚Äôm not even that tall (5‚Äô5). It barely touches my ankles! Maybe they‚Äôre supposed to be shorter‚Ä¶ not sure. I got the M and it fits too tight, so I would recommend sizing up. I‚Äôm very disappointed that they don‚Äôt look right. Maybe on someone else shorter than me."
3.0,The top fits right I just don't really care for the fabric it feels synthetic. I would prefer something softer.
3.0,"I indicate somewhat large because the bodice was too large and the arm area too tight. Going down a size would not have fixed the situation. I like the idea of the trapeze dress for the occasions I do not want anything tight or binding,this dress just didn't do it for my body type."
3.0,"I love the design & color but was disappointed in the fit. Runs small, too tight in the arms & was a lighter weight material than I thought."
3.0,"Fell apart shortly after, but looks nice!"
3.0,"This top is cute and fits well EXCEPT it's way too short. I can't lift my arms in yoga class without exposing my belly, even wearing high-waisted pants. I'm disappointed since its specifically marketed as a yoga top."
3.0,"It is beautiful, but very difficult for myself to pull up the zipper in back once I have put the blouse on."
3.0,I didn‚Äôt rate it high but I do like the dress.  The material is hot. It‚Äôs too thick for a sundress. Slips nor spanks are necessary.  I swear this thing is 100% polyester.  I had to get it 1size up. I have a belly. It was clingy at my actual size. I was going for a free flowing look.  It‚Äôs large through the bust area. I‚Äôm a DD ‚Äîat the larger size I have to really tighten the straps to make it work.  The colors are pretty in person.  It has pockets and it is long!
3.0,"They look great; However, they're so dark i cant see anything inside the car. IE speedometer, driver controls, GPS etc...."
3.0,"This is an adorable adjustable ring set. My daughter and I got them, to be matchies. The rings are very difficult to open and adjust. (Size 8 and up, will be a struggle to get open wide enough and look decent) Then, in about a month or so, the ring started to tarnish. It looks black, when it should‚Äôve been silver. It was an adorable ring, now it‚Äôs garbage. üò©"
3.0,Not black and red at all... Black and hot pink... Doesn't work for intention (with black and red swim suit) but it is cute for something else.
3.0,"I am 6'2 tall, 170lbs 30wx34L in jeans. I ordered small allowing for slight discrepancy. 30-31w, comes with a 39.3 inseam. Seems like more than enough I thought. The material is comfy, stretchy, good! They look good! Fit wise, the waist was more like a 31-32W and the inseam was like a 30-31L.So they were perfectly snug on my thighs while loose around my waist. And the Length barely touches the top of the shoes. When I would sit down they rose up way too high. I would have had to spend the day both pulling them up and down or wear boots so that I wouldn't look like I'm wear ""flood"" pants.<br />I'm unsure how there could be such a difference in the chart measurement versus the material. It is difficult to find smaller waist, longer length pants in these<br /><br />I do like the cool style though. I need them for a 70's event. So I am going to go up a size to get the length I need, find a belt and hope it doesn't bunch up the middle too much and accept the likely looseness to be in the thighs. I'll update once I've gotten them all together."
3.0,These were not all the same size so I had to give some away.  They were too small.
3.0,Fits really well but the shoulders remind me of ruffles because the ribs are so large on it. To me it would of looked better if it was down in if that makes sense?
3.0,I was a little dissapointed when they came in because some of the rings weren't the colors of the actual rings.
3.0,"I loved the skirt, however it was small....i assume its the material.<br />I need longer skirts due to being in a wheelchair, so was thrilled to find it , but had to return it"
3.0,"If you are 5'3"" or under this is too long. I'm 5'3"" and it's brushing the floor. I'll take a hem but not as I expected. The material feels cheap. More silky thin than anything close to sweatshirt material. For what I got, I overpaid."
3.0,"As others noted, mine, too, arrived broken.  I had to reattach the chain and re-glue a few stones.  Fortunately, I have the tools and for the price, it was worth it to me to make the necessary repairs.  If you are not handy, though, this may not be the necklace for you.<br /><br />No one will mistake this for Fine Jewelry, but if you are looking for a fun, inexpensive piece to get you on-board with the Statement Necklace trend, this one will take you there--but be prepared to repair on arrival."
3.0,So this is a great little purse/wallet. Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for someone who doesn‚Äôt typically like carrying around a purse with them. I am very disappointed though because mine came with the ‚Äòbromen‚Äô logo embossed on the front of it. This is not shown in any of the seller‚Äôs photos and it is also not shown in any of the photos from the reviews. I have no idea why mine has it. One of the reasons I bought it was because it had no logo on the front.<br />I knocked off one star for it having the logo in the first place and not being what was advertised. I knocked off another star for the logo being awful. The words bro and men with bunny ears? Really? I‚Äôll probably glue a metal plate over it to cover up the logo. But buyer beware that the product you get might have the weird logo on it.
3.0,I used this followed directions and followed up with the sponge and it just didn‚Äôt clean like I had hoped it was better would recommend
3.0,"Beware, you might have to get it hemmed."
3.0,"Dress is really cute, but the top portion was big.  Seems like it was made for wide shoulders."
3.0,Size up one
3.0,"Nicely made belt.<br />The buckle was larger then expected although looks good.<br /><br />This belt Never said what size it is, so I blindly got it, as I have 4 sons, and my hubby. I figured there would be at least one of them this belt would fit!<br />It now said this belt is a size 32...good cause  two of them  wear a size 32.<br /><br />That said this belt did not fit anyone!"
3.0,"Locket is large, very pretty, but chain breaks easily."
3.0,"It's a very cute dress, but the arm cuffs are super tight. Unfortunately, I'm returning it. :("
3.0,"cute patterns, but much smaller and TIGHTER than expected,  was over snug on my 4 yr old daughter, will hopefully relax a little  so they will be comfotable"
3.0,"I love the color of this band. It is the most comfortable band too because it has a slight stretch to it AND you can slide the size adjustor to fit just right. However, it occasionally pops off my fitbit so this is concerning considering how much my fitbit cost."
3.0,Returned these because they ran so small and had such a thick waistband it was giving me a muffin top. I hate panty lines and you definitely have these with this underwear because the seams are thick elastic.
3.0,"The hat does not look like the shape in picture when actually wearing it because of its narrow depth. It sits funky and can easily fall off your head. To make it fit better, I had to pull it down. Luckily my head is smaller than average size but the hat loses its shape; looking like a regular round hat, not fedora shape."
3.0,Got a large like I always do and it was way too small. The fabric doesn't have allot of stretch and think it would fit someone who was S-M. It also wasn't long enough to cover my chest. I'm 5&#34;5 164lbs. And I don't have a long torso. Maybe a bigger size XL or 2X would've fit. But over all I liked the swimsuit compared to other cheap swimsuits the material was the best I've seen so far and it is really cute just wish it fir me. üòã
3.0,"Sleeves fit really snug. I bought a large, it has the same boggie fit as seen in the pic. The material was good"
3.0,"I'm not to crazy on the material of these bibs. They seem kind of thin and cheaper. They stay kind of wrinkled up and crinkled looking. The patterns are cute but again the material is not my favorite. FYI these don't come with anything attached to the string. You need to have your own binkis or teething toys that can latch onto the straps hooked to the bibs. My voting overall would be ""just okay""."
3.0,"It looks slightly cheap, like as if fringe trim was just sewn to a big white t shirt. Definitely more of a beach cover up vibe, than a dress. The fabric doesn't breathe, its that synthetic material, not cotton."
3.0,Fabric is heavier than I expected and runs small.
3.0,"The dress is adorable and fit as expected. Unfortunately, two major issues: the dress was not sewn in two places at the waistband (I repaired with my sewing machine) and worse than that--it reeked of chemicals. Our whole house smelled like it. I've never had this experience with a new clothing item. Very strange!  I hand washed it twice and have hung it outside in the hot summer sun, and while the smell has subsided I still can't wear it. Am going to take it to the dry cleaners to see if they can get the smell out. In light of this, I can't recommend."
3.0,"I received this in a timely fashion and was excited to try it on. The material is soft but it has a polyester feel. The pants are long like in the picture, which I love, as I'm tall. But the shirt is a little small and it does not hang off the shoulder like in the picture. It fits much smaller than the pants but an overall nice outfit for the season."
3.0,"I love this necklace, but it's somewhat poorly made. The three sections aren't perfectly close together so there are openings in between. Still not bad for the price."
3.0,Size &#34;XL&#34; fits more like a &#34;L&#34;.
3.0,I got these because they're super cheap. The quality is fine. My only complaint is that the poats seems to be thinner than usual. The included backs come off very easily--I've already lost one earring when the back fell off. I've had to purchase the little plastic backs.
3.0,Material is a little shiny. Cannot return or exchange for free
3.0,It did come unglued after a few days but can be fixed.
3.0,Runs very small! Go up at least 2 sizes.
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about these pants. I bought them to keep my shirttails tucked in.<br /><br />Pros: These are made well out of a durable twill. They flare just enough. The visible buttons are cute<br /><br />Cons: Only 2 of the pockets are functional. Also, I had to cut the button holes myself (they were stitched just not cut). There are no belt loops.<br />I am somewhat curvy (I have a butt and thighs, but i'm 5'6.5&#34;, 130lbs, and fit. I normally wear a 6/8 or a 7) I chose a medium and it fits my waist, and is a good length, but is just a tiny bit too tight on my hips and thighs. This puts strain on the real pockets and the pocket seam/lining shows just enough to ruin the aesthetic. I can do squats and toe touches and bend over in these without pain, or fear that the pants will tear, but I would have liked to be able to choose an actual size based on measurements rather than small, medium, or large. Normally, I would just get the next size up and probably be very happy with them, but i'm concerned that a large will be very big in the waist or sag at the butt.<br /><br />Overall: These are a good quality material, well made, and generally very comfortable. If you're slim all around, they'll work out great. If you're a little bit curvy or athletic, you may have some issues with fit on thighs and hips."
3.0,too thin for our purposes.  broke easily
3.0,"Cheap metal, decent leather. Material chips off on it's own from the car keys themselves."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3fa711c0b1379de43a25ba2f7a7b9e8b]] I was quite disappointed as this order was to ne with obsidian beads running around the whole chain. As u can see in the video it's with a cord. Now the carving work on the obsidian is great but sending something different to what was advertised is horrible buisness etiquette.... I should be refunded or be accommodated with the actual order I ordered. Smh
3.0,I have several of these dresses because they are super comfortable. Very easy for traveling and washes well in the washing machine. 3 stars only because tej colors in this one are not as vibrant as the picture.
3.0,Definitely not the best quality but you can‚Äôt expect much for the price! Also read the reviews - they‚Äôre right. The pizza slice is out of the pocket a bit.
3.0,"There are numerous rings which are a plus, but other than this, the products are flimsy and cheap. The metal agitated my nose and made it sore. I literally am using these like daily contacts."
3.0,"It's ok.  I like that it's all white, even the logo.  What I didn't realize was that there was an American flag on the under side of the bill.  I guess I'll just have to live with it."
3.0,Wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. Runs a bit small.
3.0,"This is a nice lanyard I like the stretchy elastic and it is fairly comfortable to where (although I remove my lanyard at my desk. However, it does have a flaw in the design. The clip is made with the thick wire being twisted around with sharp ends that if you are not careful will poke your knit polo shirt creating pulls in the fabric and small holes. I now have a nice super soft knit polo that is not suitable for work in my opinion because of this. I took the original clip of this lanyard and added one from another lanyard that I did not care for and it has been great since."
3.0,The molding process kind of sucks. The metal rusts super quick while in your mouth. Maybe 3 times use for a short time. Nice to take pictures with really quick though.
3.0,"Not a bad looking purse. It's roomy, but not too big. Definitely is not leather! I'll probably keep it, rather than bother with sending it back, but the inside pocket zipper came apart the first time I used it."
3.0,didn't realize earlier but there is writing on the mat
3.0,"too tight...too small.  mashed me flat.  I wear a 42 C.  I got the largest size available (3x) and still I felt like I was in a vice.  Product returned.  They are cute, though.  also well made, just not sized correctly"
3.0,Sturdy but much smaller than the pictures led me to believe. Literally no spare room even for my phone with my wallet and coin purse this hand bag is full! Shoulder strap is not as long as the picture indicates either.
3.0,"Could use them very well, seems like lenses were too narrow?!?"
3.0,Wish I would have ordered in a smaller size
3.0,Not as like as expected.
3.0,"These are soft and comfortable. I am 32B and wear med to large in tops. Got the medium and they fit with plenty of room. They are comfortable but very stretchy -including the straps, so these will not provide much support. Good for around the house."
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and 200lbs. They fit well but are long but i think doable with a pair of heels. The only problem was they are not white,they are off-white, almost creme, so i was not able to use for my outfit."
3.0,"It is a pretty ring. My only complaint is that it claims to be surgical steel, but the charm tarnished. The bar seems fine which is the most important part, but it's still a bit aggravating. I would recommend avoiding water or wearing it for long amounts of time to help keep it from happening."
3.0,The fit and material were fine but the dress was shorter than I wanted. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and the large was too short
3.0,Not true to size feels like the clip for bra will break the way it is sewn will fall apart
3.0,"The waist size on these is pretty good. I'm between a 32 and a 34, but not quite a 34, so I ordered the 34. They fit well, with a belt, and have a little give so they aren't tight.<br /><br />However, they are big, especially in the crotch. These clearly are not meant to be form-fitting or flattering, they are meant for over-relaxing. They are very baggy. I can pull about five inches of material away from my upper thigh. The crotch hangs about 3 inches below where it probably should. Plenty of room, if that's what you like.<br /><br />The material reminds me of corduroy. It's nice and soft. The pockets are great. They come down to the top of the knee, so they are very long, even when sitting at the right spot on my waist.<br /><br />If you like to wear well-fitting clothing, these won't be for you. I'm quite physically fit and slim, and generally like to wear form-fitting clothing for a slimmer athletic look. That said, I'll be taking these on vacation and wearing them around the house, but these aren't something I'd wear out too often in public."
3.0,If these socks had not had such tight elastic at the top I would have given them 5 stars.I gave them away. Suitable for those with skinny legs.
3.0,I needed something that the cuff looks good inside and out.
3.0,it was smaller than exspected
3.0,just ok not great.
3.0,Too thick and kind of heavy
3.0,It didn't fit very well.
3.0,"The color was really pretty and they are light. Not heavy on your nose. I am a small woman with a small face and head. Normally, I have to wear kids hats because most adult hats are too big. This is to give you a size reference.  The size of the frames on my face were too big. It  covered over half my face. Way too big for me to wear."
3.0,sum ringd fitted and sum didnt!
3.0,I am usually a xl in pants so I ordered a 3X to be safe. When they came they were more like a medium. Definitely check out the size charts before ordering.
3.0,It‚Äôs definitely a synthetic costume like material not a clothing quality material. Wouldn‚Äôt breathe on a hot day.
3.0,"The purse itself was very nice, piece in the center a little loose"
3.0,Honestly kinda ugly. It made my head look so fat cause of the choker.
3.0,I like the color but It's small
3.0,"I Order M, high: 5,7. 144 pounds, some belly fat.. Lol... 36B<br />I usually fit in 6 size dress or 8 a little loose... THIS dress fit nice on my chest.. lose on my hips, the cut in the bottom is Not even left side is good in the front is short to my taste, in the right is longer than the front but not shorter than the front.<br />U can see thru.<br />I see my underwear wearing this dress.."
3.0,"Dress is see through, hard to find a slip for it because the straps are thin.  I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again."
3.0,Nice looking but the scorpion part of the wrist band can get caught on things easily because it doesn't contour around the wrist
3.0,Doesn't stay up. Slides down
3.0,"I get a ton of compliments on this shirt, and it is very comfortable. I've noticed as I wear it throughout the day it starts to gape quite a bit between buttons. It actually fits me a little loose, so that's not the problem. I think maybe there is just a lot of space between buttons? I'm just going to stitch it together to solve the problem. And thankfully when I wore it to work I had a black bodysuit on underneath."
3.0,"All things considered it is a nice cheap watch. Runs well. The band is awful though, and broke twice. I have since recovered and older watch, as this was only a temporary fill in-which is good because the band really didnt last too long."
3.0,Fits really well after a couple wash and drys.  Not very good under cold windy conditions. Otherwise pretty good.
3.0,They are super cute BUT they come with a rubber post guard to help keep them in your ears and if you aren‚Äôt extremely gentle it will instantly bend the post. I‚Äôd prefer sterling silver but until I get some higher quality these will do the trick.
3.0,Cute but the quality is meh.
3.0,"These shirts do not wick perspiration, and they run 2 sizes too small."
3.0,My husband wanted me to order these leopard skin look masks after he saw another woman wearing one - but you can hardly breath thru them so I don't wear them! To bad hubby!
3.0,Not at all the way it looks in the picture
3.0,Fits but colours very bright for me
3.0,Super cute. You can dress it up or down. Just wrinkles badly.
3.0,"I was excited when I recieved the watch since its beautiful, sleek, and dressy. Unfortunately within a few times of wearing, water fogged up inside, and after 2 weeks it stoppped working. It states that its water resistant for normal use. Obviously its not, and I want to return it."
3.0,"Not near as long as shown in the photo. A more accurate photograph would be nice. You also definitely cannot put your hands or anything else in the pockets as they're mere slits. It's a soft, cute shirt but know you're not getting what you see here!"
3.0,Way shorter and smaller in size then I thought
3.0,"It smells like chemicals at first, but the fabric feels good on. I'm hoping that the smell will go away in the wash."
3.0,Veryyyy cute but kinda too big for my 5 yr old. I obviously bought the size for 2-7 yr olds & it's too big which is weird cause I don't understand how this would fit a 2 yr old.
3.0,"The dress is OK.  The material is very thin, so I agree you cannot wear this outside the home if you are busty.  The dress was $18.99, which is entirely too much for what it is.  Should have been $10."
3.0,"The blouse is nice, material is nice but too short, especially if you are busty. I purchased a medium as that size normally is right for my DD frame, Im 5'6"" and 159 pounds. The blouse looked too too stretched on my chest area and it became a crop top"
3.0,"Shirt will be ruined before too long with how easily it gets snagged on anything. If you have pets, wear rings, or around others who wear rings - you‚Äôre doomed. Cute shirt though while it‚Äôll last."
3.0,"No review, I returned it."
3.0,The material wasn't as good quality as I expected.
3.0,For the money it's okay.
3.0,Material feels great but very casual and bigger. Hopefully it'll shrink some.
3.0,"I purchased these necklaces for a boudior photo shoot and they were perfect for that purpose.<br /><br />They are not the highest quality necklaces, but I wouldn't expect them to be at this price point.<br /><br />The color is perfect and the beads themselves are nice. They don't look cheap at all, but the finishes (bead crimps, thread they are on etc ) are at best costume level.<br /><br />I certainly expect them to hold up just fine, perfect for a one or two time dress up/theme situation, but I wouldn't wear them to try to replace genuine pearls."
3.0,Not a true size 12. Too big.
3.0,"About a full size too big, but my granddaughter does not care. She loves them. She ran off with them on. Guess I will keep them. Lol"
3.0,"It‚Äôs really cute, but made of cheap bathing suit material."
3.0,I have only been able to wear the actual stainless steel silver pair. The rest make my ears itch as they are coated and I am allergic to it.
3.0,Oh how I wish the xl large fit! It was perfect in the chest area (42DD) but the bottom area too big and saggy. It looked great on but just a little big below the waist. Love the material!!!
3.0,Keeps unhooking otherwise I love it
3.0,"Finding the right fit has become a huge challenge on the on-line shopping.  After review many products similar and owner stating it was to small went size WAAYYY UP.....big mistake. I own a shirt w/o zipper XL, great fit for 43 chest 33 waist.....freakin hard time taking it off......hence the zipper at XXL. TOOO LARGE. Once it goes on sale I'll get another one LARGE. The product does make you sweat!!!!"
3.0,These are really nice and look good.  The only problem is the little pin and spring come out to easy.
3.0,"The waist and seat fit great, but the legs are a little baggy so they rode up. The pockets are too high on the side, hitting right at my hip joint. So I couldn't use it for my phone while cycling, both uncomfortable and not secure for the phone. The way the pocket angles back my ph ou ne could work its way out and fall. They may be fine for walking or running, but I need good cycling shorts."
3.0,"Purchased for my 6 year old son, he's not chubby but muscular in the legs and rear end, he could not even get these to cover his butt crack.  Shirt was super tight.  If your child is really skinny, these would probably be ok."
3.0,"The glasses are fine, but the zipper broke day two otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."
3.0,The piece is very pretty but the sterling silver chain was tarnished. This is a gift so I guess I will try silver cleaner to brighten it up. It shouldn‚Äôt be that way when it‚Äôs brand new
3.0,"mask is very small, too small for 6 year old; otherwise seems to be well made and cute design."
3.0,It is small and does not hold a lot of cards.
3.0,Need wider brim than pic depicts.
3.0,"Has a hole at the bottom of the zipper, right out of the bag.  And a very strong perfume smell"
3.0,The metal hanger broke on my first trip.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt fit and they don‚Äôt offer in larger sizes but they got it to me right away looked like good quality just made me jelles for a smaller sized person üò´
3.0,One of these necklaces was unfortunately broken. I wish these chokers could fit tighter. They are exactly as pictured and cute!
3.0,Cool design and feel
3.0,"Just barely fit and afraid to was , it might shrink! Too delicate, to a point ."
3.0,"It's a good overall, but one of the cuff buttons fell off. They should be more secure."
3.0,"Having purchased other Soufeel charms, this one was lightweight and small.  Pretty pricy for the size/weight."
3.0,It kept rolling down my legs.
3.0,Definitely runs small.  Wore once and noticed fuzzy piling on the chest and underarm areas.  I will not purchase again.  If you want a wear and toss shirt then you may like these shirts. Price was cheap but not cheap enough for this product.
3.0,What l like most is the fabric and what l like the least is the length.
3.0,"The little adjustable piece‚Äôs end that has the metal on it gets caught/snags on everything. Like it doesn‚Äôt sit flush with the band because it‚Äôs just after the velcro, if that makes sense. Other than that, it was comfortable and clicked onto my watch easily."
3.0,"The Valknut emblem is high quality. Fits comfortably. FYI - if someone is looking for a low profile ballcap, this is NOT low profile. Neither do they claim it is; I am stating that here for clarity for buyers. The pics don't distinguish particularly well. This hat does sit up rather high, like older ballcaps."
3.0,"I returned them,  Did not look like the picture  The zipper area was very long.  Did not like them  I ordered a medium they fit as expected"
3.0,"I am buying earrings for my granddaughters 10th birthday.  Sadly, the sapphires were too dark!  Pretty little earrings, just not the right color.  Well priced, and almost perfect...‚Ä¶."
3.0,"Was really excited to get the purse, beautiful blue color ( my favorite) and soft leather.  Unfortunately it's size of a wallet,  very narrow,  I was able to fit inside only my phone,  car key in addition to that was stretching the purse. Returned it."
3.0,"These were pretty, but they were smaller than I expected and don't compliment my ear very well. If they were bigger, I would love them."
3.0,thinner smaller watch but still fits my big hands... to bad I lost it quite fast.
3.0,"The colors are nice for a change from normal pastel nightgowns, but the material is a knit, not light either.<br /><br />Fit as expected"
3.0,Asked for an extra large and got a 2 x
3.0,"It's painful to wear them all day, so you wonder if they're providing any benefit. They are hard to put on, so I disagree with the ""Easy-on"" labeling."
3.0,They will fit Polaris nets if you modify the ends. Much cheaper and they are easy to make work
3.0,I was so excited when I received the ring!  But I was disappointed at how thin it is.  I will still wear it because it is very pretty.
3.0,Typical JS sizing.  Go up one for a more comfortable fit.  Small pouch up front.  Love the minimalism.
3.0,"Loves: the look, that it doesn‚Äôt trap moisture under the band (like water from hand washing or sweat), and it‚Äôs easy to put on/take off.<br />Hate: Since the clasp is magnetic, the band tends to loosen with use. I can‚Äôt work in this band because it has loosened to the point of almost slipping of my wrist."
3.0,"Quality seems fair for price, but it is way too large in length and in width."
3.0,"Small for a 2x, o thought would be more stretchy"
3.0,"Cute bow fit 4T as expected. Did the job, but fell apart right after one use - good thing it was a one-off prop for a school play!"
3.0,"These are pretty, but I bought these compression socks to wear for work during my pregnancy, and the &#34;rough&#34; texture left considerable pattern marks in my legs and feet, so if I took them off to go out, my already-swollen legs looked even more odd. I would have liked a smoother / finer texture for compression socks."
3.0,Cute and exactly what you'd expect
3.0,I sometimes buy a small and it big. So I didn‚Äôt want to get a medium but this size small is a baby small. Lol.  Can‚Äôt even go over my head
3.0,ok but nothing special
3.0,"Love the fit of the shirt and it's great but it's supposed to be home of the black flame candle not ""blach"". It's a shame because the shirt is great aside from this really bad error."
3.0,"These are basically gardening gloves, I don't see how they're going to provide any cold weather protection."
3.0,"Half of the bees arrived with a lot of dislodged crystals (one had 10 that were fallen out). It was a bit disappointing, as I was wanting to use these in acrylic coasters. Ended up buying a second set, so I could complete the coaster set. They're really cool looking... I just wish they'd been more durable. If they fell apart like that in shipping... people making jewelry would be really up a creek."
3.0,"It is such a clingy material.  looks bad at the top of the jeans, even leggings have to be super smooth.  I returned it."
3.0,Long in leg length and short in hips.  More like a hip hugger cut which isn't mentioned so I am disappointed since cost so much.  Was out of town when arrived and now believe too late to return unfortunately.
3.0,It's a pretty dress but I wish it had a little more &#34;give&#34; at the waistline.  It's a little too snug for me to wear not but I've been working on losing a little weight and it should be able to fit more comfortably after another 5 lb. loss.  The pix of customers on line sold the dress.  Everyone looked so nice in this dress.
3.0,These are super stretchy but they are see throug. I don‚Äôt mind them with a long tee .I Love the color I ordered a XL and usually wear size 14 pants.
3.0,"When I ordered this, I thought the blue strips on the front were part of the fly, but it turns out there's no fly on the whole thing. The front is actually a pouch that thrusts your junk forward, rather awkwardly sometimes (I don't know about you guys, but I don't care to know how my manhood looks all squished up). Otherwise, it fits just fine, and the mesh is moderately comfortable. However, getting an erection while wearing these can be uncomfortable, as the mesh can rub your...well, &#34;head&#34; the wrong way. Not a bad pair of underwear per se, just not what I expected."
3.0,I loved the look of these shoes BUT after a couple hours of wear I had 3 different blisters on my ankles. Very dissatisfied with the make of this shoe. No issues with seller just horrible design on MKs part! I would not buy these if I had the option again.
3.0,The large size ran small.  It was really a 10 rather than a 12.
3.0,Runs a bit on the small size; I normally wear a size 6-8 but this is tight to the point of almost not wanting to wear it. Scoop neck is nice as is the racer back but the medium impact makes this less versatile. Overall I'd go a size up and probably go with another brand for both fit and support.
3.0,These shoes run small and the charge doesn't last long... My son had these shoes for just two months before they wouldn't charge
3.0,Looks exactly as pictured but strong moth ball smell and I've tried everything but cannot kill the odor.
3.0,Good watch.  Comfortable. Downside is that it scratches easily for those who workout a lot or are active
3.0,The material was a little  too flimsy..but other than that I love it!
3.0,"Nice material, however I usually wear small and this small was waaaayyyyy too big for me"
3.0,"Love the color, exactly how it looks in the pictures. I‚Äôm an Xl or large in dress sizes ( mainly for length and I have big hips) and a medium for T-shirts but couldn‚Äôt even get this (xl) over my shoulders. Definitely size up."
3.0,"Xtra LARGE MEANS,,,,,<br />Extra Large....... Look it up!"
3.0,"This is a nice dress, with soft fabric, but it is very clingy.  It showcases everything, so not for me."
3.0,It's nice looking but the pins that can with it were to small. Therefore I had to use my other ones from my other band. It was frustrating due to the band coming off with the pins that came with the band.
3.0,"Fit well, back of bra is pokey and uncomfortable, came with all pieces"
3.0,I was disappointed that the set is pictured with gloves but gloves are not included. Otherwise its fine.
3.0,I bought for Walt Disney world cus we stay at resorts on property and I wanted a character that was still ME. I have plans to use ears headband with this suit at pool. The fabric is middle of road nothing special. The bottom is reversible. The top cups are nicely constructed. I wish it was a triangle style Aka boring af lol. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the money. I think it looks like $18 MAX. IM<br />NOT GONNA CHANGE LIVES WITH THIS LOL. it will be cute for WDW. the xl fits like a junior large. I wear 11 pants and the xl bottom is cheeky and mid rise which is fine. The cups in top fit me which is like a large B or small c cup.
3.0,"These sandals fit as expected and are adorable. However, the Velcro doesn't hold and opens easily while wearing."
3.0,Pretty good umbrella. It would be helpful if there were some instructions how to open it and close it. I shouldn‚Äôt have to have an associates degree just to open an umbrella. But we like it. Once we learned how to work it.
3.0,Delivery was fast. The top fit good bottoms small.
3.0,"Product not as advertised also, product had defects in some of the functions blood pressure monitor was way off battery life advertise for 7 to 10 days I got 48 hours!"
3.0,These did not hold up well at all for our granddaughter.  Screw on backs were not real good.  After a couple of uses and some aggravation they were pitched into the junk jewelry drawer.
3.0,Looks better than it works.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this bracelet. Atnd I do. It is beautiful. However , after about an hour of wearing I noticed something was scratching my wrist/arm. The band has a knot that is out and scratches my skin constantly. After another hour I took it off, was unable to hide or move the little knot. It can't be cut as it keeps the bracelet together. However, i am able to use if wearing long sleeve..."
3.0,"I sized up like some suggested and these are still too small, will donate them."
3.0,I was very pleased with the selection and quality.
3.0,"Without the shield, hat fits great! With the shield, the front is weighed down and I can‚Äôt see anything. There is no way that I could see to fix the issue. Too bad because this is so cute and would have been perfect during covid!"
3.0,I really loved these glasses they were really cute I just wish they would have lasted longer
3.0,I have to made it shoe. Couldn‚Äôt ask more for this price... it was pretty and cute!
3.0,Pretty dress but didn't fit well I ordered a xl and it was too small sent it back I normally wear a 12-14 and have a large bust
3.0,"I got this top after seeing a review from a friend w/ a poet (not sure if it was the same brand but concept was the same). I decided to try it since I was having nasal surgery and the hospital recommended a button or zippered top to avoid bumping my nose.<br /><br />Pros: It did make getting dressed and undressed easier and somewhat faster. I do like that there are even side zippers that I can leave unzipped near the bottom to make the top lay flatter since I'm in a wheelchair and always have problems with tops and coats not laying flat and giving me that unwanted pouch look.<br /><br />Cons: For me the biggest con are the zippers, especially for the shoulders. I'm not sure if it is because the top has a faux mandarin collar, but once the shoulder zippers are zipped, it really irritated my neck because it doesn't lay flat on my shoulder. I tried leaving it a tad unzipped but that doesn't look right.  My other issue is the zippers aren't good quality and get stuck easily.  The top isn't as bad as the zippered pants I got from the same company (that zipper completely broke at the hospital!) but still, for the process and that these are meant to help aid individuals with their independence, better zippers need to be used."
3.0,The shoe is a navy blue but it‚Äôs not as dark as the picture. The item pops up under prime items that should arrive quickly but took almost 16 days to arrive.
3.0,"The quality of this product is a little cheap. The price point reflects the quality. You will definitely need to size up with this one. It runs small. Light weight, cute sweater."
3.0,"This shoe was stiff and had zero flex. Not at all comfortable. Also runs a bit small, we choose to err on the side of caution and return."
3.0,Loved the fit however the color is not a clean dark black. Almost looks a bit faded. Still cute just not the coloring I was hoping for.
3.0,"Good Strap. Its thicker than normal nylon NATO straps. The only thing I don't like is that the holes came out of the box frayed. Not too big of a deal considering the durability of the strap. Good company, I would buy something else from them."
3.0,Thought I ordered a longer one
3.0,"We ordered this product but did not receive the shorts, only the shirt. The material is very soft but very see-through. True to size."
3.0,It arrived sooner then expected.  And the fit was ok.  Not sure if it will shrink once washed but it was priced great. Every where else I searched offered it at a lower price but shipping it was more then the product. So I got a great deal on the sweater with free shipping so I would definitely purchase from them again.
3.0,"Inaccurate website description of fabric. It is not 35% polyester and 65% cotton. Garment tag: 80% polyester, 15% cotton, 5% spandex. It also runs large."
3.0,The shipping and delivery was actually faster than the expected date by 2 weeks but as I wore it for a few days it started to change color on the back from having contact with my skin.
3.0,"It is pretty- I think the photo makes it appea like there is more shape to it than there is- it is a wrap/ shawl with no arm holes or anything. My one complaint is that I wore it with all black and the shawl shed terribly. I looked like I'd laid in a dog kennel all day after wearing it a couple of hours. Hope it sheds less with increased use; if not, I won't get much wear out of it."
3.0,Wood grain missing. Looks odd. Kept because unique. But poor quality control.
3.0,Not what I expected. Sort of cheap.
3.0,"These are very cute, and I will enjoy wearing them anywhere but on my ears.  These hurt like the dickens.  They are so large that they cover the earlobe and then hang over even more at the bottom, which I don't consider attractive (just my opinion), and they are very heavy.  They made my ears terribly sore.  I have never had earrings that hurt like these (I've had pierced ears for many years).  I'll modify them by shortening the posts and then wearing them as pins.  I wish they were just a wee bit smaller and more comfortable, as they are really pretty."
3.0,Everything was just as expected except the back is like a snap back and not an adjustable strap.
3.0,This vest runs extremely small.
3.0,It's a little tight around the armpits and shorter than I was hoping for. I got the same size in a different color that fit perfectly. Sizing is not consistent at all
3.0,They wasn't what I thought I was looking for them to be bigger
3.0,If you're a big guy or normal size 36/38 get the 2x. Trust me
3.0,"Material seems decent for moderately cold temps, but size was waaaay too small. Felt like it was a children's size."
3.0,"I like the colors but size runs a bit small. It was tight on hips. Otherwise good buy. Not great, good."
3.0,The size is not true and quality of material looks cheap
3.0,"The color is not as I expected, looks better on the picture, the white is not white, its more like a beige"
3.0,"This was a great necklace for my one-time wear for professional family pictures. However, it definitely isn‚Äôt made to last. The strings come out way too easy, and this necklace was shedding before I was even finished getting ready. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
3.0,"It's definately cheaper looking than the photo shows.  be warned, your finger will turn green"
3.0,Im on the fence about the rating. Im the biggest costume jewelry fan ever. The positives are You get alot of pieces and variety but overall some of the pieces look cheap to remedy that I wear just 1 necklace looks better than wearing 3..u get what u pay for
3.0,"I usually wear a 14/XL, I purchased this at a XXXL because I had read review saying it ran small and I like things roomy, even ordering several sizes to big this was snug!"
3.0,"Cute, but I lost one the 2nd time I wore them. I couldn't get the rubber post on the earrings so I guess it just fell off."
3.0,Love the bling. No pocket for filter
3.0,Hugs all my fat rolls very thin material had to wear a slip. Would not buy again
3.0,"While this style seems like it would accommodate a large bust, it won't!  Long and full skirt but top is too narrow. :("
3.0,"The reason I bought these jeans is because they come in 27' inseam. 27' inseam are extremely hard to find. I like the length but not so much the width at the bottom of the jeans. They are pretty wide. If they were a lot more narrow, I'd buy more. I like the wrangler 28' inseam jeans a lot better."
3.0,Material is a bit on the cheaper side; ok made
3.0,Cool and comfortable.  Waistband too snug creating a pot belly look.
3.0,"I ordered a large, but it was very tight around the breast area. I suggest ordering a size up if you are a little bit more bustier. The material was also very cheap!"
3.0,Wish the hooks were clear or even nude. Bright white shows too much.
3.0,"The dress is very cute, material is good.  I went by the size chart, but it runs small.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 36DD"
3.0,"Cute, cute, and super soft fabric, but a little thin. I hot the black and white stripe, and they're fine as long as you wear black underwear underneath. I'm usually a 2x, I bought a 3x and they fit well, but are tight in the waist and dont stretch at all in the waist. They fit my ""thunder"" thighs well."
3.0,"Beautifully crafted... tiny AF.. it looked much bigger in the picture, but be prepared, its small."
3.0,"the hoodie is really baggie, a unisex S is always a perfect fit for me and the S was so baggy and made you look stuffy."
3.0,Fit perfect. But broke at 5th time of use.
3.0,"Lightweight, very small"
3.0,I ordered my regular size (xl) based on reviews saying it fit as expected. It was way too small and accentuated every problem area I have :( I would have reordered a larger size but I used a coupon to purchase it (45% off!) and couldn't bring myself to reorder at full price. The overall feel of the fabric and colors in the pattern were very nice. I'm really sad that this didn't work out for me.
3.0,Really nice material shirt. The colors are great and it‚Äôs not shiny or cheap looking. Unfortunately they sent me the wrong size!
3.0,"it feels like it's worth what I paid for it, but that's fine. I don't need an Armani dufflebag to hold roadside emergency gear."
3.0,I like the product but started to get a small hole in one of the bags (at the seam) after a couple months
3.0,The color of black was not shiny didn't like the opaque  color
3.0,"I‚Äôm surprised how I‚Äôve bought their Fair Isle pjs for my kids each year and even this year and thought the quality of all their pajamas would be this good, but their not. These ones the pants threads are not as tight so they will easily wear out over time"
3.0,"Like the colors and style but  even after following the sizing suggestions, somehow I ended up with a suit that was too small"
3.0,"They are pretty, however, read carefully the description.  If you think that you are getting the real deal for a good price, you are not.  Beware of ""inspire"" in the description or ""elements"" cause its not real crystal or swarovski (I kinda sensed that as they were not expensive).  But, I got what I paid for.  They do look like they are worth more, so I'll keep them.  Just don't let anyone handle them as they are a hard plastic, not even glass."
3.0,Got this to make a Backdrop and one out of 12 came faded and dirty it was like so obvious so had to delete leave a row out. Dissapointed not gonna spend another 15$ to replace one. Oh well.
3.0,"Great for the wind. Doesn‚Äôt necessarily keep your hands warm but no where near as cold without them. Definitely would recommend liners. Riding with these takes some adjusting because they are thick gloves and it is as if you slid on a set of sausage fingers. Take it easy and get comfortable with them especially if you have a sensitive throttle  because there is a learning curve. That is the only gripe I have is they arent the most comfortable to ride with and sometimes I accidentally roll on the throttle when I don‚Äôt intend to because the gloves are so thick. However, i wont get frostbite from windchill so that is a huge plus. Id rather accidentally roll on the throttle than my hands hurting because it is sooooo freaking cold and i literally am holding the side of my engine barehanded to get my hands warm. Sure beats that."
3.0,The purse is super cute but I was upset to see that one of the straps had a defect to it. I trimmed it the best I could.
3.0,Ordered a navy hoodie. Received a all black one. Why?
3.0,"I just &#34;like&#34; the charm. It was not as cute as I thought it would be. However, I am still satisfied with my purchase, for I collect angels. I gave it 3 stars because it is more &#34;OKAY&#34; than &#34;REALLY NICE&#34;.  I wanted an angel for my Pandora charm bracelet collection. I will look for a nicer one to add, as well."
3.0,its ok check back later
3.0,The top portion of the lens is blurry.  The bottom portion is great for reading.
3.0,"I bought this for my very thin very thin 15 year old, the waist was so small that my even thinner with no but or hips 10 year old could barely fit into it.  she's at least a head shorter than most girls her age, and just bones.  that's saying something if it doesn't fit and it's for woman."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt get to wear it yet.  Have to loose 20 lbs!
3.0,"Pretty and dainty. I always receive complements when I wear it. It stands out, but isn't too big. The chain has knotted several times."
3.0,The fabric is pretty poor quality. They need to be washed several times before they're even remotely comfortable.
3.0,The color was as pictured and it is pretty soft.  It just wasn't very flattering on me. I did return it.
3.0,expected better quality
3.0,I had to return this hat. It was supposed to fit an adult even my granddaughter said it was to small for her head. It was really soft and beautifully designed I would have loved to been able to wear it. It had no give in it whatsoever.
3.0,It runs very small but I can wear it as a top.......
3.0,"This vest was okay, I‚Äôm normally a small but this was a bit to short and the arm holes were to tight as well so I sent it back and got a different brand that I was more familiar with."
3.0,because of the layers it tends to ride up to your waist & you have to constantly pull the back of it down. other than that it is a nice blouse
3.0,"I got the smallest size and it was still big on me. The shoulders would fall off and it didn‚Äôt look flattering on my body at all. Nothing a trip to the modiste couldn‚Äôt fix but still annoying and disappointing.<br />For reference my measurements are the following:<br />Height - 5‚Äô6 ft<br />Weight - 124 pounds<br />Bust - 32B<br />Hips - 36 in<br /><br />I‚Äôm giving it 3 stars because the fabric is really nice, looks just like the pictures and is very well made."
3.0,Didn't look as good as the picture but will keep them as the price was good and they arn't too bad.
3.0,Just a little to big and not as much stretch as I'd expected.
3.0,"Fun, festive"
3.0,I disliked the poor quality of the material. I liked the color and the way it fitted.
3.0,Washing it...was a joke
3.0,"My daughter has a themed last week of school and for super hero day she wanted to be Pikachu. Is Pikachu a super hero? Who knows, but that's what my 6-year-old-wanted. There were some cute one- piece outfits, but I was worried about her trying to wriggle out of it to go to the bathroom last minute, and figured this would be easier.<br />Well, being that we're months away from Halloween, costumes aren't easy to come by. Thank you Amazon Prime for coming to the rescue! However, this costume is cheaply made to say the least! There is a 2 inch long shiny streak down the front of the costume. The fit is very tight. It definately runs really small. My daughter typically wears an 8 and I got her the large and it barely fits. The hat is very tight and the ears are floppy and do not stand up. That was disappointing to my daughter. There are a couple of small black marks on the hat as well, but I don't think she noticed. The leg things are too big and slide down easily.<br />The ONLY reason this costume isn't being returned is because my daughter absolutely loves it. Otherwise, it would be going back in a heartbeat! Not impressed at all! It's really too bad. It looks cute in the picture."
3.0,"The saying is nice, it was a cute stocking stuffer, but overall cheap quality."
3.0,I liked them a lot but only 3 stars since there was no zipper. Otherwise they are great.
3.0,Super cute. Although half of the ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù phrases are backwards. Super confusing because it‚Äôs  only half
3.0,"While these are stylish glasses and the arms are long enough for my larger head, I find these combination reading/sun glasses a tad inscrutable.  The idea is a good one but the execution isn't the best.<br /><br />The etch line between the reading lens and the outer standard lens is large and very difficult to ignore.  It is so prominent that I can't really use these glasses for anything other than reading.  It would be nice to be outside working in the yard and able to read an instruction manual for a new piece of yard equipment; sadly, I find the reading lens so bent at the outer side edges that I can only look head-on to read.  That the lenses are darkened by design means that they can't really be used in a lower light situation such as inside a garage.  So, their usefulness is extremely limited.<br /><br />Also, one of the arms seems to be loosening and I've only worn them a few times.  The hinge at the rim on the left had a lot of wiggle room when I first took them out of the box and I will likely have to glue them in order to wear them -- if I do.<br /><br />On the positive side, the packing is good.  I like the case and I also like the removable nose bridge pads.  (This makes cleaning that area easier.)  And these sunglasses really do look good on me.  I just wish they were better designed and constructed."
3.0,"I'm am actually very disappointed by this dress. The skirt on this does not look like the photo. The photo makes it seem more free flowing, but the one I got is very stiff and doesn't fall properly on my body. It literally sticks out awkwardly in certain areas. I'm going to try and do some ironing on it today to see if I can fix it. I sure hope I can, because it has potential. I will update this review at some point."
3.0,My daughter bought this and has some qualms about it. It is a good quality but does not fit as advertised. The top is very loose but the bottom fits pretty good. This is why I am giving it 3 stars.
3.0,It was ok. I left it in my camping stuff. It just isn‚Äôt really comfortable.
3.0,"I love the look, but it wasn‚Äôt as dark as it was on the picture. Still a lovely tee."
3.0,"Let me start by saying.. I love the quality and the color of this shirt. It washes nice. Comes out of the dryer nice. Irons well. The shipping time was amazing.  But,  I ended up ordering 2 of these shirts. One a 3 xl. Fits more like a 2xl. I then ordered a 4xl. Fits in the stomach like a 3xl but sleeves were 3 inches too long and it hangs off the shoulders. I tried to send the one back but it was $8 so I kept it."
3.0,I bought three of these tops. The quality is good but the shoulder fit is odd. The ribbon is too stiff causing the shoulders to bunch up.
3.0,"Decent hat for canoeing.  Relatively thin fabric doesn't have much shape, but will keep the rain off you on the river."
3.0,liked the style but the sleeves are a snug...and i do not have large arms
3.0,Honestly wanted to love this dress as well as take it on vacation but it‚Äôs too see through. I could see through it in my house which is dark. Don‚Äôt want to know how bad it would be on a boardwalk. Unless that‚Äôs the look your going for then this is perfect. The pattern is beautiful. It‚Äôs the perfect bathing suit cover up I guess
3.0,"I love everything about this dress!... the ruffles, the hemline, the cute straps... except it‚Äôs pretty sheer. You can‚Äôt really wear a slip with it either bc of the unique hemline. If you are going to wear it, you definitely need some nude undergarments and it also may need to be worn at night! üòÇ<br /><br />If you think this review is helpful and want to see more, you can follow me on IG, Amazon, or FB @prettycheapmama<br /><br />Happy shopping!,<br />PCM"
3.0,"Not as expected. Disappointed but I did not have time to send them back. Too large, make me feel like a clown."
3.0,It's beautiful but I can't fix it like the picture
3.0,Im normal a medium. Im 5‚Äô4 130 and this medium is ginormous on me. To where i could definitely wear a xs. I actually have to tie the sides its so big. Its good quality and soft on a good note. itd be flattering if i wasn‚Äôt swimming in it.
3.0,"Colors are off from the listing. Was expecting it to be more calm/neutral colors but the orange is bright. Not sure I want to keep it.  Sizing is always a challenge with Zaful. Small is too small, but medium is just a bit too big"
3.0,The dress was too large HOWEVER just because it didn't fit doesn't mean there was anything WRONG with it.<br />It was a beautiful color and soft flowing fabric. Very disappointed it didn't fit but I find S-M-L-XL sizes are always<br />iffy. Will exchange for smaller size.
3.0,"I got this to bridge from winter season to summer. It should work for that. The 3X fits my fatty bicycle body well enough. The pants are almost too tight in the calf for my large legs. The thighs and hips are so stretchy they should fit anyone as long as the person is close in size. The jacket is stretchy and can even accommodate a vest or sweatshirt underneath for insulation. The insulation on the jacket and pants is quite thin, again not for winter. There is absolutely no resistance to rain. The color matches my red/black bicycle scheme. The contrasting colors should be visible to cars from any angle. The reflectorized area on the back is way too small to be significant, but it is there. I had to put on my waterproof rain jacket when I tried it today with very light rain. Three stars because of the winter comment and rain resistant comment. True to size."
3.0,not bad but the shirt is too thin
3.0,I wanted to love these but they‚Äôre just not jogger material. They are more like legging material made into a jogger. Was looking for something more cozy so sending back.
3.0,I really like the sunglasses. They are fun and really are polarized.  I would have given these a 5 star but the glasses and the case smelled like smoke.  So if you suffer from allergies or are sensitive to smoke you may want to reconsider.
3.0,The scarf isn't as nice as I thought it would be. It's not as thick and looks a little cheap
3.0,"These could not even remotely be considered &#34;sun&#34; glasses, but we only bought them for a photo prop, so they served our purposes. They are also very flimsy and can be easily bent with fingertips or anything else that contacts them. Bend them more than once and I suspect they will break. For a novelty one time use prop they are fine and cheap enough at under $2 a pair, but don't be thinking they are sunglasses."
3.0,Straps to short
3.0,"Need extra sole inside boot, my feet was hurting after a couple of hours of wearing them, other than that cute boot size I ordered was perfect. I wear a 6 and I ordered 6 1/2"
3.0,When I speak the plastic fogs up. Smashes my lips. I will regift. Doesn't look high quality. Laughable
3.0,"Was initially impressed with these frames, BUT they do come apart and my son has figured that out and lost one of the pieces. Do you guys sell replacement pieces? I don‚Äôt want to purchase a whole new pair of frames when I only need one small part. They lasted a whole week in our house. üò≠"
3.0,The eyes were a little small but over all a good mask.
3.0,"My wife said the color of these glasses was nice, but they were not comfortable and did not look good on her.  She did not like the thickness at the outer edge of the lens."
3.0,Nice ..but definitely not for men..I originally purchased it for my self but upon receiving it decided it was more suitable for my daughter.
3.0,So there is nothing wrong with this outfit but it doesn't look good on me. The middle colors look cartoonish and it was too long. I bought a size small and it was dragging. With heels I am good. But the outfit is not faltering. So for me it is a 3 star but if it looked good on me then it would of been a 5. Just my opinion. I am 5'5 and 125lb and a 36DD on a normal day 36DDD on a what is going on day.
3.0,Too long for me. But looks decent. Not worth$50+.
3.0,"the stone does not look like a Sapphire at all, but other than that I am happy with it."
3.0,"They are cute and fit well in my cartilage piercing. My only complaint is that you only get 6 colors, not the 12 that are advertised. You get 6 pairs rather than 12 individual colors."
3.0,"They fit great, really like the material and very comfortable"
3.0,Awe! A very comfortable and classy sweater. Quite cute and works well with casual outfits for all play and some play settings. I've had the opportunity to wash on several occasions and experienced no fading or shrinkage post machine washer. My only problem with this sweater is that it runs small!
3.0,"I like this llittle piece. It fits kind of nice. Not perfect but very nice. I like how the style is a bit diffrent, and you can just put it on and go. But it fits really nice, Its a great price."
3.0,Disappointed.......The skirt portion is Georgette material. Looks cheap.......and see-through. nothing like the picture.
3.0,"I love the shirt but should've kept the other reviews in mind.. I wear a 2x..it was thin, which I didn't mind but it wasn't long enough and the sleeves were a tad tight. Overall it's a great shirt for the money but it definitely runs small üòü"
3.0,The item delivered is not the same color as the picture at all. It appeared to be a light gold but what I got was more bronze.
3.0,"Robe came with threads hanging off of it. Also the robe is a little tight around the shoulders and arm area.  The fabric is great though, nice and silky smooth.  Just doesn't fit as well as hoped."
3.0,The pendant is a lot larger than I expected. The color of green is lighter in person than the picture. However the chain is very nice.
3.0,"Cute shirt, loved the lettuce sleeves, and bottom edge, but it shrunk. Am keeping it so I will be able to wear it once I lose some more weight."
3.0,Nice smooth caps!! wish they were a little longer for folding or more hair.
3.0,"The color is brighter in person, and it has a wide-ish neckline. I like it and wear it but would not buy again."
3.0,The brackets are so cute but break so easily. They were pretty loose on my wrist but randomly started to break
3.0,Good but could be wider so that it will fit a bottle of rum.
3.0,"I bought the Navy Blue floral in Medium, because I had already already ordered the green one, which I love. This one makes me look fat and could barely zip it up. Will be returning. Order up a couple sizes."
3.0,"Fabric was meh, I returned it"
3.0,Slightly too large and lenses pop out
3.0,"This is a very pretty bra, but it has no wire. It does not help to lift at all. I was hoping this would be a cheaper option, and could out-perform, a VS bra- but sadly it can/is not."
3.0,I bought this watch two years ago from a reputable jeweler.  The watch band lasted only 10 month with very light wear and extreme care.  After much haggling they sent me a new band.  The new band lasted only less than 11 months.  They are clearly defective.
3.0,Looks just as depicted although much wider than expected. If you have a short waist forget this one
3.0,"For the price and the bulk of the product this is really nice to play around with different kinds of earrings. The only thing was that I fell the material was too bulky for my frame and did not look good. I do adore it but just not for me,"
3.0,Good color and comfortable material. Fits like a t-shirt. The material is substantial enough to provide good coverage but it fit a little smaller than expected. The tie belt is a nice touch and gives the dress some different styles. Fun and comfy. Just wish it would have been cut a little bigger!
3.0,The sizes run a bit small. The quality is ok.
3.0,Way too long & I hate the elastic band. It rolls constantly. I really wouldn't recommend this unless you are tall & thin.
3.0,"The dress is nice. It's hard to find dresses with pockets and this one has them. However, for me since I'm petite, the waistline drops a tad too low."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. This is a pretty dress and it is comfortable. It fits as expected. The fabric is very thin (flimsy) and 100% cotton. Keep that in mind when laundering. I will hand wash in cold water and hang dry. It requires ironing as it qrinkles badly. The colors were true to the pictures online. I odered the aqua blue with red flowers. I do not like the buttons, they simply don't match the dress. They are white with yellow and black. I will change them to coconut shell buttons. The sleeves are not hemmed.  They only have a serged finish. I will be hemming the sleeves. The bodice is a little skewed, as well. It is slightly off center. I purchased this for a beach vacation, so it suits my needs for the price."
3.0,They are fine for play shoes. They wear/scuff really easily. But for the price they are ok.
3.0,Loved the item but it was too small. I order a medium because I fit into a small or medium in lingerie and this piece was too small. It doesn't have enough stretch.
3.0,I need to send this one back and I don't know what to do. It is a beautiful dress and I like the material but it didn't fit well on my granddaughter.
3.0,"I don‚Äôt like the string on this cardigan, I took it off because I felt like it really made me look larger than I am and forced the front chest to fold oddly. I am 5‚Äô5, size 6 and always a medium."
3.0,"Nice quality, but A LOT bigger than I imagined."
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and Medium size is too short. Not good quality material. I have bought the same design with different seller called R. Vivimos and its so much better quality and the length is perfect for my height. Don‚Äôt waste your money and time with this
3.0,"It's very pretty, but tarnishes easily and along with that, starts to smell."
3.0,Love the color. Had loose fit on shoulder arms I was not comfortable with.
3.0,"Hello I ordered this hat in order to avoid the sloppy, floppy look of most conventional sun hats out there, however, this hat is still quite floppy and instead of giving the crisp, fedora look, seems somewhere in between the average Columbia style sun hat and a neater look."
3.0,The design of this suit is lovely and it is well made. I had to return it because the design of the midsection emphasized my muffin top - it's not a good design for people wanting to de-emphasize a bigger tummy.
3.0,"Great price, wish the pearl was smaller."
3.0,"My thin son wears 32x32 normally. Since these were Asian made, I decided to get 34. Too small in the length and thigh but good quality. So I returned for 36. Too big, even the tag and care label were different. I‚Äôll keep the 36 due to quality and hope they shrink"
3.0,"It's cute, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,It‚Äôs OK for a shirt I wanted it for a lightweight jacket for you
3.0,Doesn't fit right. Good for the value.
3.0,Nice skirt.  Fits too small.
3.0,Fabric is synthetic and feels uncomfortable.
3.0,Product arrived dirty. Not sure if it was used or they cleaned the floor of the warehouse with it before sending it. Luckily it was machine washable and the funk washed away.
3.0,"Cute enough, but very pointy! For short hair gals only!!"
3.0,One of the selling points for these socks was the advertised fact of their being so easy to put on.  No way!! No How!!  I help my husband to put on his compression socks with the aid of a sock assist device.  These socks were extremely difficult to load on the device & Very difficult to pull up.  There is no way that a person can put these on by themselves.
3.0,The light colors show every line and crevice  so not the most flattering but very comfy
3.0,It‚Äôs a little big and the material is a bit different then what I was expecting but it‚Äôs still very cute .
3.0,"I likes the length of the legs on these pants, and I liked that they were very tapered at the ankle. But the waist was way too loose for a size 14. They were baggy and started sliding down instantly. I would recommend going down a side when buying."
3.0,"This was too long for me, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0‚Äù and it swallowed me. It was cute but not for me."
3.0,I think the shorts are cute.  They feel cheaply made.  Washed well the first time.  They fit as expected.
3.0,It was much smaller than it appeared online
3.0,My wife likes thus string of pearls. But the picture they have here must be 2 necklaces or a very small neck prop. My wife wears hers wrapped twice and that leaves them hanging loosely to about mid chest. 3 times and they start getting tight. I think 4 times would be impossible. And the 5 wrap they have shown here I think is somehow faked.
3.0,The inside plastic did not last a month.  I did drop it twice.  It is now in tow pieces.  Still latches but everything comes out every time I open it.<br />I do like that everything is protected for RFI and dirt and grime.
3.0,"The fabric was good quality, but definitely size up. My daughter is in 7-8 and this was way too small. It fit, but was uncomfortably snug."
3.0,I did not get the color represented in the picture all thew its a nice wallet for the money I payed I would have liked the  shown what I received was a dark gray in color
3.0,Pretty cheap never wore it
3.0,Not a good shirt I'm my opinion. Too thin and too small even though I ordered 2 sizes bigger on purpose but still very tight. Don't recommend
3.0,The shoe is very pretty. Exactly as pictured. Runs big. The material is a bit rigid. My daughter doesn‚Äôt love them but tolerates them for fancy quick event.
3.0,These are very nice however they run very narrow.
3.0,These do not fit any woman in my family. They didn't even fit my teenage niece. They did fit my 4 and 8 year old nieces. I cannot say these are women's bracelets. They do seem yo be of good quality and they buckle nicley. However they are a bit too much for the younger girls imho so they're headed back to Amazon.
3.0,"This is a well made coin purse for men.  The leather is tough and should last a long time.  I got it for myself, but it turned out I did not like the flap closure and it was too small for coins.  However, I have found a good alternative use--I use it to hold guitar picks!  I carry this around in my gear bag and always have more than enough picks.  It is slim and does not take up much room and is perfect for that!"
3.0,"The suit is cute but fits oddly. The elastic on the waist band is very tight and dug into my waist very unflattering. I dont have big boobs so the top was WAY to big. The pads in the top were moving all over the place and made the top look worse. Also the top had plastic rods that were protruding out and digging in my underarms, very uncomfortable. I'm 5' 6&#34; and 180lbs usually wear a lg to xl. I bought an XL in this suit. It's just not for me. It's a great suit for larger chested women unfortunately I'm not."
3.0,"No stretch at top and bottom, yarn broke and frayed after putting them on."
3.0,disappointed that's it's not a minimizer.
3.0,Color was nice..... but the fit was too big to be just a Medium
3.0,"Bought these for my daughter she is 3, neck holes are VERY tight. Not a lot of give on the neckline. Had to snip the neckline with scissors to make it fit. Other than that she and I love the designs. .."
3.0,"Colors  in description show a more green and actual is much more blue than green. Blue, gray and black bands are closer but description photos are brighter colors"
3.0,This is a beautiful dress but very curve hugging and the material is stretchy but fades if it‚Äôs stretched even the slightest. I have a DD chest and it‚Äôs a good thing the top part is mostly the light colored pattern. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and about 158 and the medium fits well.
3.0,No me gust√≥ como queda. Tuve que eliminarle una de pulseras para que se viera mejor.
3.0,"Definitely runs big. I'm a Walmart medium, not a vanity sized medium haha, these are baggy. I'll keep to bum around the yard and house because I love my animal prints but it definitely looks weird üòÖ shiny spandex material baggy isn't a good look"
3.0,I bought it for my boyfriend who has very long dreads it can't stay on the weight of his hair drags it off backwards
3.0,I have only wore the bracelet twice and the color is already wearing off of the band
3.0,"THER were very comfortable, polarization Was good; so much so,it pretty much wiped out the heads up information display on my car‚Äôswindsh.  So I can say with assurance, glare Is 95% neutralized.  What I didn‚Äôt like is the plastic lens were not optically clear so everything was a bit fuzzy and unclear.  I had to go back to my glass Lenses to see clearly.  The case is nice but I would suggest they use optically clear lenses."
3.0,"They're okay. They are too tight when you first put them on, it's suffocating. But then when they're stretched out, they end up falling off my face."
3.0,"These were cute and a great idea for trouser socks since they are so thin, but they do snag, and now after several wears and washes are starting to fall apart too. The mesh material is what snags, just like pantyhose will, so that section can get a ""run"" in it. I have seen similar ones with flowers, shapes, etc on them and they all have that issue. Cute, but know that they will ""malfunction"" on you sooner than later."
3.0,Looks nice but won't stay tightened.
3.0,Made very well but cups are bulky and has no support
3.0,It is a pretty ring and it is adjustable to fit any finger. The only thing i don‚Äôt like is the side of the ring is very thin.
3.0,"My son is a size 9 in Nike‚Äôs, Champion shoes with a bit of room for thick socks that make the for just right. Theses rain boots on for my son‚Äôs feet with he does not wear socks and even then they are a tight for."
3.0,"I'm looking for a blush or dusty rose lace dress to wear to my son's wedding in June and ordered this in both the Xl and XXL. It looks well made but the sizing is really off. I normally between a 12 and 14 and after reading the reviews I decided to order both sizes. The XL was a bit snug around the waist and through the bust but fine through the hips. The XXL was to big in the waist and the bust and gaps under the arms. I have tried ordering other dresses of different styles and found similar problems. I can purchase a brand name such as Calvin Kline or Jones of New York and they fit fine.  I appreciate Amazon free shipping and returns but it's a bit frustrating to have to order so many sizes only to return or in my case I may keep the XXL and have it altered. For reference I'm 5'3"", 170lbs, 36DDD bust."
3.0,Horrible chain. It looks old and not at all attractive.<br /><br />I took the pendent off the chain and used it as a decorative piece to my key chain.
3.0,could be better quality. over all its cool and does its purpose. make sure to have extra powerful batteries because generic ones dont work with it
3.0,"Nice weight and very flattering on.<br />However, it's pretty short. I'm 5'11 and expected an ankle length but instead It's an awkward above ankle length. If you 5'6 or under, this is the dress for you."
3.0,I like the material and it‚Äôs nicely made but it‚Äôs too big I should have went by the size chart and did a 2x but I listened to the reviews that it runs small and went with 3x and it‚Äôs too big in the top
3.0,This sweatshirt needs to be longer in the body. It‚Äôs too short
3.0,This suit is adorable however the top is very cheap. The bottoms are very well made while the top is see through.
3.0,"I wanted a nice emerald or hunter green dress and received a Kelly green one which was disappointing.  It is way too heavy for a summer dress as the photos imply.  It does fit well enough though, I guess I‚Äôll save it for a xmas party."
3.0,"It fit weird... best I can explain it. It's super form fitting in the body, and kind fb of loose in the arms. And I have big arms, so it's usually the other way around... just kinda odd."
3.0,"Warning, these are not ""sweatpants"" as advertised in the title. They are very thin, similar to a windbreaker material. It does look as advertised and does fit well, hence why I'm giving it 3 stars. But still returning as it was not what I was looking for."
3.0,Too big for a charm bracelet.
3.0,Perfect for a child. It's very small and cute. the hook between the cross and the chain keeps getting stuck and that drives me crazy. I like it but I had to stop wearing it because of hook issue.
3.0,I‚Äôd say this is really cool but diamonds fall out. I guess it‚Äôs made so you have to just put it on the wall. Overall it was a good birthday gift. Little pricy for not being able to get many extra diamonds.
3.0,"I just received my BITCH earrings today and although they are cute and I will keep them, I am a little disappointed. I must first say the shipping is amazing. I wasn't supposed to get them until Aug 10th and they arrived today, July 22nd, so I am very pleased with that. The problem I have with them is that they are way off center. One is worse than the other but they're both off. Another problem is they are very thin and cheap looking. They really remind me of a thumb tack, no joke, they're that thin. They are cute and I have decided not to return them but I definitely don't think they're worth the money- even though they were pretty cheap."
3.0,A bit heavier than I would like it but a nice product that serves its purpose.
3.0,while the set was very nice it was too small in the top. May try to order a larger size.
3.0,"The product is ""lovely to look at,"" but the clasp tends to be loose and comes open on occasion.  I'll try to tighten it myself.  Had a jeweler remove several links so it fit properly. Excellent price!"
3.0,"Big but comfy - cheap but it is... love the color . Shrinks - for that was good, except for length. Runs large - best for around the house or with leggings."
3.0,Mask didn't fit as well as I hoped.  It sits farther down on my face than I would like. It also arrived cracked in the middle due to poor packaging.
3.0,It fits big. Sleeves are too long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 170 pounds and normally fit in large. This is okay fit on body but arms are way long
3.0,"This item fits well and the color is as shown, however, the knit fabric is very thin.  A quality fabric would have a higher percentage of cotton and be made in the USA."
3.0,Fits great but do not dry. They pumpkin stuck together and caused part of it to rip off
3.0,"Sizing seemed way too small. I bought a Size 5 for my son to replace his 4.5. These size 5 were the same size as his 4.5's. So buy a whole size big and you should be okay. Seemed like a decent cleat, but just too small."
3.0,Decent quality.. Was expecting it to be better..
3.0,"I swear to God if my.wife buys another one of these stupid hats, I'm leaving her"
3.0,The silver pieces were tarnished. There was clumps of cut string fiber like they were trimmed inside the box. The layers on the tassels were unlevel. You get what you pay for. I'm still gonna rock em anyway.
3.0,"I gave it 3 stars. Because although I am returning it, due to being disappointed with the fit. It is a very BEAUTIFUL product! Colors are JUST what you see in the picture.<br /><br />I ordered an XXL. Because obviously I am a big & tall guy. Were there an XXXL available, I would simply switch out sizes. So be advised to order a size larger. Especially if you have big muscular arms. Dear Sellers: if you're reading this, make a few XXXL in this style and you've got yourself a DEAL!"
3.0,"These leggings are ok. I wore them all day yesterday to power-wash the driveway. I received a size Medium, and they seem a bit small. I'm 5'4"" and 117 lbs. Pulling them up as high as they go the pants don't go all the way down to my ankle but right above it. That was annoying.<br /><br />Also, the white stripe along the sides makes the bottom of the pant leg flare out a bit, so they don't sit tight around your leg at the bottom. Overall, these are just so-so. I wouldn't purchase a pair, but since they were free, I'll continue to wear them while I do odd jobs around the house."
3.0,Its a nice top however sizing runs a bit bigger and color is a dull
3.0,when you order this dress you might want to go two sizes bigger.<br />over all it's a really cute dress...
3.0,They're not half sizes. I bought the 6.5-7 and they were size 7 so a little big. I wear a 6.5.
3.0,"This looks like a dress in the photo, but it's not really. It has slits up the side up to the waist, so you'll have to wear pants under it or maybe a really nice slip that you don't mind showing off. That said, I really like the fabric and the buttons up the front. It's definitely too big in the chest and shoulders for me - usually things are too small in that area. I'm 5'6&#34;, 155 lbs, 36DD bra. I am fairly broad-shouldered, and I don't have skinny arms either, but this is probably a couple of sizes too big on top. I'd say it would easily fit a size 12-14. It's really pretty though, so I'm keeping it and will just wear it over leggings or a long cotton skirt."
3.0,"It‚Äôs comfortable, but it is too small I can only put it on the first hook and it keeps popping off"
3.0,"No pockets. Pockets is literally in the title of the dress. Skirt not quite as full as expected. Fabric nice and soft. True to color. Will wear, but really annoyed about the lack of advertised pockets."
3.0,Tiny wrist people will like these
3.0,The color is cute but the cut is very strange. It's tight in my chest area and boxy in my waist so it's not very flattering.
3.0,the color went dowen very fast
3.0,"These have textured fingers which is really nice. They also allow me to use my phone with them on. They have a super horrible smell that is impossible to wash off, and they all make your hands extremely sweaty."
3.0,too small & tight
3.0,I'm 5'5. And 150lbs.  Ordered a large.  It fit fine.  The length was exactly as shown in the picture; right below my knee. The fabric is thin and not high quality thus the 3 stars.
3.0,Its coo.. i feel it should hug in the fat a lil more...but works!!!
3.0,"I bought this 3 pack for variety in bands, but one of the 3 is put together backwards.  There is no way to fix this, so unless I ignore that one side black and one side is blue‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it‚Äôs useless.  I really wanted to wear the blue one too.  Other than that, bands are soft, comfortable and functional."
3.0,"Ordered the brighter blue, received Navy instead.  Sent feedback to seller. No response. Bf is okay with them, I would have returned them not only because of the color but because they run small and aren't as warm as other fleece gloves that I have."
3.0,"I really wanted these pants and in every color. But, they fit like a glove through the legs and entirely too baggy and high waisted through the hips and waist. Not even a belt and baggy shirt would help me remedy how loose these were and keep them held up. I wear a 2 in jeans and ordered a small. I have wide hips and thick thighs. So disappointed. Also, there are no back pockets so it looked just terrible."
3.0,Wasn't as shiny as the picture depicts
3.0,Purchased for my daughter and she loved it. Thanks
3.0,"not for curvy folks. shoulders and hips tight while waist had way too much material. looked frumpy, would ride up if I walked more than 10 steps"
3.0,Within two hours it have a run in back
3.0,"These socks run small but will help with swelling.  Not the best on the market, but they are helpful."
3.0,"Looks great. Sized well for a dude. The bead for the clasp of the cotton corded one broke after only wearing it twice, making it pretty expensive per wear.<br /><br />(Update). The company contacted me and offered to both replace the bracelet and refund me.  I didn‚Äôt take them up on it, but they made quite an effort to make it right. I appreciate the good customer service."
3.0,"I had bought two of these shirts in size large. While the Maroon came quite in the usual large size which fit quite well, the other charcoal was unusually bigger and clumsy. I live in Jamaica and have to have my Amazon items brought back to me after I send them to an American address. And so it is almost impossible to do a return."
3.0,"It serves its purpose. When I received it and used it after a few weeks, one of the zippers broke."
3.0,Alittle right below waist
3.0,Silk should be soft and lightweight. These masks dont feel anything like that. There‚Äôs a thick padded layer of some crap under the silk. The only good thing about that os that it keeps your face warm
3.0,"Not as wide as I would've liked, but still functional."
3.0,Top part of dress is too short - unless you are high waisted!
3.0,Looked bigger in picture
3.0,Ordered the blue since my fianc√© loves blue and polka dots and scarfs. Got sent a black one. Gave it 3 stars cause the scarf is still cool plus I got a new keyring out of it.
3.0,"My watch arrived in a small box and well wrapped. The design was just as expected. One bummer was that the watch came already ticking so I have no idea how long the battery will last.<br /><br />The overall look of the piece resembles semi-costume jewelry. But for the price, it‚Äôs fine."
3.0,"I was disappointed in this item.  It is much cheaper looking than it appears in the picture.  It will probably look fine from a distance, but it is not as nice as some of the other items I ordered from China at a lower price.  I paid close to five dollars overall and I don't  think it is worth that.  It is now listed at two dollars, which I might have been satisfied with.  It is a Christmas gift, so I can't attest to the usage conditions/quality yet."
3.0,People will definitely see you and your dog at night so no worries there.  Don't understand why the put the pocket facing the inside of the vest.  Would have been a great place to put dog treats if it were on the outside.
3.0,Arrived crushed. Had to wet and reshape several times
3.0,"This watch is a real deal for the price. It's small and lightweight, which is not easy to find in an automatic watch. In fact prior to spotting this the only thing that came close to the size I wanted were watches by Rolex, Rado, etc and the like going for thousands of dollars even used. Makes sense; it costs a lot more to make an automatic movement that's miniature. Somehow Orient has done it, but set your expectations. This isn't going to be sturdy and durable like a Rolex or even a Seiko. The way I look at it, for a small fraction of the price of a Rolex can get t his watch in a few more colors (hmm! Xmas wish list) and be set for years.<br /><br />The watch keeps very good time so far and though the hands don't seem to be luminous, it's very readable under all lighted conditions. Yesterday I intentionally let the watch run down for eval purposes. It started up immediately with a few gentle shakes, after which I tested winding, which works as well. The watch is still running accurately.<br /><br />The weave of the bracelet is lovely; it gives the watch an opulent look. The latch opens and closes very easily and securely. I intend to have a couple of links taken out, but it's quite wearable as it is on my medium-boned wrist. Doesn't slide off my hand. I just shove it up my arm a tad if I need it to stay stationary.<br /><br />The color is a thrill for this purple person, it's a genuine royal purple rather than the orchid, lavender or plum that some so called ""purple"" items turn out to be. Yet it's just plummy enough to be worn as a neutral tone, even in summer. IMO actually more versatile than red or royal blue. Go for it!<br /><br />The day/date are very small and there's no magnifying dome over them as there might be on a larger or more expensive watch. Not a complaint; when you go for small, small is what you get. The date is quite readable and that's what you'll glance at. The day, maybe you squint for a minute but be honest would you even miss the day if it weren't there?<br /><br />Speaking of setting the day, maybe I can spare you a moment of confusion. Though it's mentions in the booklet that comes with the watch that you can choose between English and Spanish days, the meaning of that may not register. Here's how it works: The two languages alternate as you scroll through the list of days-SUN, DOM, MON, LUN, TUE, MAR, WED, MIE, etc.  I guess at midnight the day display advances two clicks. Say the watch is on MON. It moves through LUN to TUE. So if you choose your day in English you stay there; presumably Spanish works the same.<br /><br />This is actually very cunning, something to delight those of us who love the little complications on our watches. It's only a problem when you first try to set the day. You're squinting at the little abbreviations and saying what's MAR? Isn't that a month? Now you'll know what's going on. Here's a helpful tip: The Sunday pair (SUN, then DOM) is in red. So get yourself to Sunday then count forward.<br /><br />****UPDATE**** OOPS! A larger issue has now come up.<br /><br />I posted my review too early. Apparently when I reset the time yesterday I didn't do the noon vs midnight calculation correctly. At noon today the day/date advanced to tomorrow. A routine mishap for those of us who wear automatics.<br /><br />The wrinkle: This time as I was resetting the day and date, the crown flew off the stem and landed at my feet (lucky roll). I was not pulling hard on it in any way. I was able to snap it the crown back on but reset action is now not smooth, I'm sure because things aren't perfectly aligned. I can change the days as easily as ever but it's a huge struggle to move the date numbers.<br /><br />I'm going to attempt to exchange it. No reason to think vendor won't cooperate based on guarantee/reports from other reviewers. Hopefully the next one I get will be perfect; for sure I'll treat it tenderly.<br /><br />I have to knock off stars for now. Can't mislead others when this product may not perform as it should. I'll keep you posted by updating this review.<br /><br />What should you do in the meantime? No other reviewers have reported this issue though one did report that the watch ran very fast. We're probably looking at inferior quality control. They may need to hire the watchmaking equivalent of a chiropractor :-) Based on all the reviews I've seen, I'd go ahead and try this; it's guaranteed after all. Just pull the crown out mindfully when you do need to reset. And as with all mechanical watches, if you can give it 30-40 rotations even on the days when you don't wear it, you won't have to reset as often."
3.0,"Ordered this as a "" just in case"" outfit for my trip to Nolia. It looks so cheap and thrown together. Not a great purchase"
3.0,Had to roll down to about midnight calf in order to use. Had to get off also.
3.0,Shorts were a little snug for my momma bottom...top was just right
3.0,"I think it is a great style, but the suit was too short for me."
3.0,Soft.  Tight across toes.
3.0,Wore these for my son's wedding--unfortunately got a contact dermatitis for weeks after wearing.  But received compliments
3.0,"It's good while it lasts, just not very durable."
3.0,Quality seems good but sizes are not accurate. My son wears an 11 1/2 and the large was too small.
3.0,The fit was great...I just didn't like the material. Should have ordered the black instead!
3.0,Too large for an 11 - returned
3.0,Muy bonita pero su tela es muy sueba y eso la aser ser mas grande la talla delo normal
3.0,"I'm 5'10 and they are too short and loose around the ankles. Soft and comfortable. If they fit tighter around ankle I could probably stretch then to be a better length, but as is they ride up."
3.0,"Center of tie was significantly off so one side larger &#34;bow&#34; than other.  I was able to push it towards the left bow which did finally center it (if not, it would have received one star).  It should not have left the warehouse looking like that.  Material feels cheap to be completely honest.  The pattern was nice howevere, esp the colors.  Remember, you get what you pay for."
3.0,"looks ok for the price but you have to know that the fabric is really poor, very light."
3.0,Need more of a selection an a bit pricey.
3.0,"Fits Large,except in arms,but i have large arms.However the dress is huge other wise. Will keep for lounge wear. Love the fabric and colors.Length is as pictured."
3.0,"This was a good product but it didn't work the way I thought it would.<br />It blends real good but it doesn't save time, if anything it takes longer.<br />Personally I still prefer my blenders and brushes."
3.0,It‚Äôs cute but it broke within 24 hours of wearing it...
3.0,"I didn't quite expect the design of the pants or the short legs. These pants are about 2 to 3 inches shorter than I expected. They bleed in the wash and seem to stretch out quickly. For the price, it's worth it and I'm happy."
3.0,my grand daughter loved it ty
3.0,Not what it looks like in the picture and not as soft as I‚Äôd hoped it would be. Sending back.
3.0,"This is fairly, nicely thick at 16 mm on the side of the case.  It‚Äôs one of the thicker watches I‚Äôve ever seen and heavy for a watch.  First impression was like wearing an alarm clock.  However, it will do for informal wear.<br /><br />The first thing I asked myself when I got it is why is it called a ‚Äútonneau‚Äù watch.  Come to find out, that‚Äôs a French word and means the watch face is shaped like a barrel.  Looking at the face of it, I can see it resembling the profile of a barrel.<br /><br />The watch band is a rubberized-looking silicon and very  rigid.  It‚Äôs  unwieldy to strap on because it‚Äôs so stiff.  It is a skeleton, kind of, sort of.  You see elements of the movement but I wouldn‚Äôt totally classify it as a skeleton watch.  I certainly wouldn‚Äôt call it a mechanical skeleton watch since it‚Äôs quartz.<br /><br />It does have a luminous dial that if you expose to light, will light up in the dark.  Under normal household lighting, I found it did not light up.  Only after I held it directly above a table lamp for a minute did I see the glowing effect in the dark.<br /><br />It does have some interesting features like a date movement.  Why they chose to attach it in such a way that the numbers are upside down to the hands telling the time is a mystery. They could have just had just as  easily created a small dial with the numbers oriented in the proper direction that would have worked.  It ‚Äòs almost like this was an afterthought.  I actually thought I was wearing the watch upside down until I looked at it closer.<br /><br />I did get it to set the date once but then I had trouble trying to make further adjustments.  It has a date function and another number wheel that I never have figured out. The instructions weren‚Äôt of any help on that. Time, date and week?"
3.0,Way bigger than I thought they were gonna be but the quality it decent
3.0,too short in the front...
3.0,The shirt is not a regular cut. I always purchase XL this is a small XL. This fitted a person who wears a medium. But the fabric is great.
3.0,"Very thin, clingy t-shirt material, but very comfortable."
3.0,Great product except the white outline has worn off quickly....
3.0,There is not a halter to this cover up and I received a different print than desired/ordered. Okay quality for the money spent.
3.0,"Beautiful little handy watches. I don't want to place a hole in my scrubs so I clip it to my name badge.<br />Downside about this is that one of the watches did not work. Otherwise, pretty good."
3.0,I like baggy and comfy but this was a bit much
3.0,I'd go down a size
3.0,Looks good with quality at this price.
3.0,"Meh.  The color is great, but this is a very fitted dress, and it's pretty snug on me.  I ordered my usual size for these types of items, but this one doesn't fit so well.  And I don't like the really wide neckline so much, either.<br /><br />I don't really want to bother with returning the item, so I'll try to salvage it with a scarf."
3.0,"Order 2 sizes larger, or it will be too small"
3.0,"So I'm returning this because of the material.. the fit was fine but the material is like a thin t-shirt, which I don't particularly care for. The black looked pretty faded, unsure if that was supposed to be the style"
3.0,"It's nice, but the material is cheaply made."
3.0,You cannot put it in yourself and it doesn‚Äôt completely unsnap on the shoulders. But it was better than a regular shirt
3.0,"Not bad. The hanging hook gets in the way  of zipping back up and it would be nice if the bag had a sturdier flat bottom, so it would stand better on its own."
3.0,Cute AF but it broke the first day I wore it :c
3.0,The print looked a bit like a cat and ther see-through for sure but i love the idea and decided i would keep them and wear with a longer shirt.  Nice feel and fast shipping!
3.0,It‚Äôs not the greatest quality but it‚Äôs pretty and washes well.
3.0,The pants are too large. Would order a number smaller. Other than that good product
3.0,dont care for the weight or the material
3.0,"This top is very loose fitting and basically puffs out everywhere. I thought it would be more fitted. It's also a bit of an awkward length (right above my hips) to where it sort of looks like it went through the wash and shrunk in length only. However the print is very crisp and the material isn't too thin, and it is pretty comfortable. Disappointed it didn't fit as expected."
3.0,First time order was the wrong size.  Got refunded & ordered again.  Right size.  Grandson loves them.
3.0,"I just received these but they look great and are super soft. I wore them taking the dog outside when it was low 20s and they kept me warm. Very happy. I typically wear XL, but I went with XXL. I‚Äôm glad I did because think XL may have been too tight. But great.<br /><br />Update: After about 3 washes, the stitching has come undone. They‚Äôre still wearable but a little disappointed. Not sure how durable these will be. Otherwise they‚Äôre great!"
3.0,"It's a little pricey for what it is. The crown is folded and hard to keep on, the gem came off during the day."
3.0,I bought them for my 2 year old grandson as his rain boots tend to fall off easily. They help to keep his boots on but he does not like wearing them. He says &#34;no&#34; when I try to put them on. For some reason he doesn't like them.
3.0,"I dont know, I mean it holds my pants up, so that is good, but my wife says it is not real Leather. I mean it says leather but it is priced pretty cheap for real leather. So it seems a little thin, mi wife says its 2 pieces of something glued together, I dont know, my eyes are going I think, she tells me to look and I say I see it, but I dont really ....I know it doesn't say genuine leather on it, my eyes are not that bad. I gave it a 3 because it serves its purpose."
3.0,Product arrived with a broken zipper. Klim seems pretty over hyped. Quality was good but the plastic zipper came broken so I wonder if the ykk zips aren't as great as people thought.
3.0,"If you are wanting a necklace for short term, then this is perfect. If you want a necklace that you will have a while, this is not the one to get.  I literally wore the necklace 2 days and it broke."
3.0,Bought a size larger than I usually wear and this item was still too small. Very disappointed!
3.0,the batteries were very hard to work with and quite difficult
3.0,"I got this for a wedding, and the material was way too sheer. It also was pretty loose and made me look like a pilgrim."
3.0,Nice dress but had to return; it was way too small.
3.0,I received the band today. Looks really plasticky no Metal overtones at all. I'm not sure of durability. Wears pretty well not heavy at all my arms are hairless so I'm not sure of the ‚Äùhair pinch‚Äù we get from other similar styled bands. The clamp seems to hold pretty right. I would have returned it had I inspected it closer before removing a link for a tighter fit. If I did order again it wouldn't be this style. I ordered a case for my watch as well just hoping it matches since most my jewelry is gold. I'll update later
3.0,"shoe is a bit hard to break in, but have gotten many compliments on them.  i would consider buying again."
3.0,Unfortunately I‚Äôm going to send this dress back. It‚Äôs SO cute and I love the thicker fabric. I read the reviews carefully and ordered the size I thought would fit me and it is WAY too small. I would definitely size larger if you‚Äôre on the fence!
3.0,"Saw all the comments about size so I ordered a large for woman who probably wears a small. It's a wee bit big but when she put the dog in the pocket, she was happy with the size and said she would not want it smaller. Quality is ok/not bad--That was a happy surprise."
3.0,"Very thing rings, had to wear 2 to make it thick enough. Decent for the price you pay"
3.0,Smaller than I thought. Perfect for a man!
3.0,"I really thought this would be exactly what I was looking for, but the first time I tried it on, the catch in the back came loose and i have not been able to get it back on due to my poor eyesight and allergies."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:8ff8e8c82f5cf214728e5da091867861]] Like style, but don't  like size how fit on me..."
3.0,"use it as nightgown, too small thru body and large up top!"
3.0,At first the umbrella was fine. It was a little tough to get anchored in the stand but perhaps I needed a stronger stand. Then I noticed a rip in the fabric months later. Not a huge deal but not cute either. Then a wind storm came and tore this umbrella a new you know what. It looks like some prototype for a Mad Max movie. Fabric flew off and the bars are pointing every which way. RIP.
3.0,Nice warm hat.  Both of the furry balls fell off the first week and had to be sewed back on.
3.0,My first pair the lenses delaminated.  I contacted knockaround customer service and they offered to replace them at no cost. Hopefully second pair will last longer.
3.0,"I kinda expected these to be a little bit unstable, but I was a little shocked that the clasp on the ankle strap was actually a snap.  It has popped off one or two times and caused some consternation."
3.0,Size 1 size to small quality good
3.0,These things seem ok'ish for the price. Not as stretchy as I'd like. They're nice and thin so they shouldn't be too hot to wear. One of the three did fall apart during the first wash I put it through. The bottom seam came undone and totally unraveled. I ended up with a large ball of clothing because the continuous thread wrapped itself around 4 or 5 other garments. The quality just isn't acceptable. Wouldn't recommend purchasing these.
3.0,"Hat is great except the strap doesn‚Äôt match the hat.  The hat is black, blue, and white, but the strap is pink, blue and white.  It looks like they took a strap from a different hat and put it on this hat.  I like the hat and hope they correct this error."
3.0,Very cheaply made. Fit me too small. I ordered an XL and weight 175lbs and am 5‚Äô2
3.0,"Nice feel but slips down easy, but it is warm"
3.0,They fit great! But they're definitely not waterproof. Maybe the pocket liners but that's it.
3.0,Some of the screws were stripped so my daughter can only wear 2 pairs
3.0,"Fit good. Bought it for a Halloween costume and it was perfect for that. However, I wouldn't want to use it often with my infant because it is not soft. It's a bit scratchy even after a couple of washes."
3.0,"They're cheap and they work, but they seem to be closer to 10x, comparing to a more expensive 20x I have."
3.0,Size is appropriate but there is a terrible itchy fishing line type thread used at the bottom. Irritated my skin. I tried buffing out with nail file but it just unravels. Helped a little but now looks kinda cruddy.
3.0,"They were cheap so I wasn't expecting much. Good for a costume, but definitely not for daily wear. There were two in the shipment. Wasn't expecting that so not sure if it was an accident or I just didn't read description very well."
3.0,Awkward fit because of the way it was sewn. I sent it back for refund.
3.0,The romper is very short in the legs. Almost no coverage. I‚Äôm not very tall so I can‚Äôt imagine how it would fit someone over 5‚Äô3‚Äù<br />I wish this came in a long pants version of this romper
3.0,Nice Matt finish mask but it is a better fit for wider faces. Did not work for me.
3.0,The fit is a bit off. The mouth in the photo fits to my chin<br />But it‚Äôs cool
3.0,"I knew it was cropped, but if you have a large chest, it just barely reaches over your bra. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and have a 34DD. It‚Äôs skin tight on me because it has to stretch over. But the sleeves and just as pictured."
3.0,"Well, it looks slightly fake because of the color of the stone, that's why i.m giving it 3 stars, i would have like it to look little more real."
3.0,"It was a very pretty pattern. Unfortunately, the skirt of the dress was too heavy and despite getting a smaller size, the dress was just too long for me. I'm average height so I think it's just that the fabric was heavy and pulled the waist down too much."
3.0,"They are nice and warm as expected.  There is little to no sole support. In fact, the sole feels like it is sagging. But comfy otherwise. The fit is a little snug over the toes."
3.0,"This ring is large and heavy. As you could see it is much bigger than my other rings. It is also heavy so if the fit is not good it will not stay straight on your finger and will shift from side to side because of the weight. It is also very flashy and shiny. It's a nice ring, especially if you like big and flashy, but it's to bulky for my small hand."
3.0,Love the crosses but started tarnishing right away‚òπ
3.0,Gave as a gift the recipient is happy
3.0,Pretty. I have yet to put it in my ear because the back part of it is just so small I don't think even a 2 year olds hands could screw it in. It does look nice though.
3.0,It is good. My son loves it. It's brighter then what I expected.
3.0,"I completely love the horseshoes, they work out great! These are awesome quality and I love the color assortment ment. The only issue I had was that I was hoping to use a captive bead ring in my cartilage, but there is no way to do that without stretching the earrings since the opening is way too small."
3.0,"I like this bra! I wear a size C bra, so this bra didn't fully cover my areola. I have to keep adjusting it to cover them back up. I like that I can loosen the chain that goes around my back. I will still wear this at home since it makes me fill so feminine!"
3.0,"I sometimes have trouble getting my ring off for the gym as my knuckles swell easily,  and was really hoping this would work when i am doing a WOD vs straight lifting where I can wear gloves. I sized up to a large based on my small fingers (size 5) and the carat size (2) as suggestec and i could barely get it over my knuckle and the ring. Once it was on, it was a little too big where the ring actually sits so it slid around and exposed the band a little.  I was only rowing that day so I dealt with it,  but would never wear this for any barbell, dumbbell or rig work. Really wanted this to work for me,  guess its just not right for my fingers.  I also don't think it is intended for any stones i would say over 1 carat."
3.0,I loved the way the shirt looked however after wearing it for a couple of hours it seemed to start piling. Im not sure about the material.
3.0,Liked pattern & size. Did not like center zip pocket
3.0,This earring is beautiful... my only issue is that it is so much bigger that I was hoping it would be
3.0,These rings are cool but they arent as clean as the picture shows. One of mine came all bent into a werid shape but it was very easy to bend back into place. Overall they are okkkkk
3.0,The size was great but the one sided print was VERY  disappointing!
3.0,Bottoms are way to big and top is small
3.0,I love the color but I didn‚Äôt realize the zipper in the back would bother me so much. The material is thinner than I expected it to be. Ended up returning.
3.0,Started to unravel after the first wear
3.0,I wear smalls and mediums (size 2-8) and this engulfed me and it wasn‚Äôt oversized in a cute way because it was too stiff to fall in a flattering way.
3.0,Unraveled after first wash.  Small size and tight fit with limited stretch. Probably best for women and kids. Not the softest material.
3.0,Clasp tends to come undone frequently..
3.0,"I am almost 5'5"" and these came all the way down to mid-calf on me. They looked sloppy. Returned."
3.0,"I bought this watch in June 2018. Overall, it's a good watch and good value for the money. I've gotten compliments on it, and it isn't flashy or showy, just a decent looking watch. However, after about a year, condensation started getting under the cover. Wouldn't always stay there, but was noticeable. Then after about a year and two months, the second hand started getting stuck, and finally stopped working. I'm still buying another one, since it is a good value for what you get, but be warned that this is a case where you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Was fund for the kid to wear this year, but the motor kept falling off."
3.0,Very cute. Good material. The only thing is the pants fit kinda small. But other then that it is great.
3.0,"It came bended!<br />Not easy to use, the cards fell when you open it.<br />It‚Äôs  easy to scratch.<br />Very disappointing"
3.0,Not the best quality but good for a certain one time event.
3.0,The ability to have a high ponytail is awesome but the quality is extremely cheap. It still looks very cool though!
3.0,Very nice just a little to wide
3.0,"I should've looked carefully at the measurements. This case was the size of my billfold.  It looks great in the pictures and the leather quality is okay, a bit stiff, but I would think it will soften over use and time, however, the size was unexpectedly large. Unfortunately had to return."
3.0,"Ordered a large but it fit like a small, sleeve length isn't enough when lifting arms. I'm 5'2 so overall length isn't great. Very warm and lightweight."
3.0,"The pattern of the clothing isn't exactly focused, more of a splotchy jumble. The belt got lost within the first hour of putting it on, which is fine because it was basically a glittery zip-tie type of thing.<br /><br />It's held up to abuse quiye admirably. But it's not exactly breathable, and it's a little itchy and thicker than i would want to wear.  My daughter is pretty ho-hum about it.  She will wear it if given to her, but won't actively seek it out."
3.0,This fit as expected given the size chart. It does however like to unfold at the neckline and creep up the shoulders.
3.0,"I was really hoping this dress would work for an upcoming wedding. However, it is much too large and there is very little elastic to even keep the dress up at the bust. Sadly, I will be returning it. Pretty color and seems to be of nice quality fabric though."
3.0,The belt keeps slipping  out of the loops
3.0,Looks good. Pretty but it won't stay up.
3.0,"Pendant larger than expected but beautiful<br />Chain was absolute shit, tarnished after 3 wears!"
3.0,I wear mens 10.5 4e shoe. I tried the one size fits all and the Xl versions of this sock and they were too tight. This XXL fits comfortably.
3.0,"This mask is a silicone-like material, just like the masks inside the Halloween aisle in department stores. So not very high quality at all. It looks decent enough, but the real issue is the eye holes. They're INCREDIBLY small, and in my experience, only one eye lines up with the hole. I cosplay a lot, and walking through a crowded convention center hall, trying to look at vendors items, take pictures, and dodge other people, all while looking through a single hole smaller than an Advil pill sounds terrible.<br /><br />With that being said, the fabric, which is glued onto the top of the mask, is very nice and plenty long enough to tie under your chin. I think I'm going to try to peel the fabric off of this mask and use it on a 3D printed one."
3.0,I returned this simply because the color is off. Viewed on multiple screens the dress advertised looks like a mustard yellow but the item that arrived was drab brown.
3.0,"For the price of $5, I had to get it. It is very cute. I'm hoping it doesn't tarnish.<br /><br />Update: after 2 wears, chain snapped. Unable to fix. At least it was only $5."
3.0,"they actually work well for the thin material, they are running short so if you're tall like me get extra long -"
3.0,Found them to be to snug in the inseam area.
3.0,"This bracelet appealed to me more online than in person. I dont like the gold chain that hangs on the bottom. I might cut it off. This bracelet feels bulky on my wrist and wasnt as attractive as the photo. I havent worn it yet, debating on regifting it. lol"
3.0,Fun to wear! I call my lil dragon Lil Lucifer
3.0,I can't breathe too well in the mask
3.0,"don't like for me, will give it away."
3.0,"Yes these do look like photo, BUT they run really small got a XL and got sent large and even my hubby could not get them on and he has small legs. Not sellers fault but the people who make them"
3.0,These are interesting but a bit clunky.
3.0,"I feel like it‚Äôs going to snap when even the slightest breeze hits it. We‚Äôll see how long it lasts. So far I like the umbrella material, the frame just doesn‚Äôt seem very sturdy. We have it bolted to the deck and I love the 360 swivel but I wish it tilted both directions so I can block the sun in the mornings."
3.0,I love the colors and style of these panties. They are so cute but had to give 3 stars due to the quality. The panties were actually a little big on me when I first wore them bit now after a few months they have shrunk quite a bit after several washes. I'm sad I won't be able to wear them longer though because they're really cute
3.0,I would have preferred a bit more room in the waist and upper arm areas. I do like it though. The color and pattern are just as described. The fabric isn‚Äôt very high quality.
3.0,Great at night when city driving in the rain with all of the glare. Thats really the only time they seem to help though.
3.0,Shipping took a long time and when it got here it was the right size wrong color.<br />It is very comfortable for long days on your feet. Looks very sturdy and supportive.<br />Wish i could purchase from a closer seller.
3.0,Worked as expected.  Little on the heavy side if being used for a key ring.
3.0,I usually wear large/xl. I ordered a 2x and it fits like a small large. I couldn't even get it zipped. It was also like putting on a tarp and super hot.
3.0,Fits small got a large and it didn‚Äôt fit the arms were too tight. It‚Äôs nice tho
3.0,"I was super excited to get these leggings becaue they are really cute, but they're see-through :("
3.0,"Odd fit, pockets made it bulky. I usually love pockets on dresses. But the pockets on this one made me look enormous"
3.0,Could have been better.  though it does its job and hold my daughters hair when she plays soccer. its little better then the sparkly ones.
3.0,"This was really cute, but fit me kind of awkwardly. I'm 5'11 and roughly 125, so it was really short on my torso, but a bit loose in the chest. I would recommend it for anyone with a shorter torso!"
3.0,The ring for Tobi is way to small to fit perfectly on your thumb. You can force it on but eventually you'll end up loosing blood flow in your thumb because the ring is so tight around your thumb
3.0,The dress is cute.. It is a silky soft material so it does wrinkle easy and some how I overlooked that this is a maxi dress not knee length.
3.0,La verdad me pareci√≥ muy burda su elaboraci√≥n y terminado en la foto se ve m√°s pulido m√°s fino
3.0,"Thought I was sizing up & ordered the large for a 6 year old‚Ä¶it was so small, it barely fits our two year old! The material is quality & the pattern is SO cute! Just make sure you size up about 3 sizes!"
3.0,"Bought the chain with 3 birthday pendants for a birthday present for my boyfriend‚Äôs mom. The chain would not close so i went to Kohl‚Äôs to get a new one along with a jewelry box because it did not come in one, considering we are giving her gifts today I‚Äôm a little upset but the pendants are cute, glad i got it to work out."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:dc51c3a2ba0f1fe883b476fd708c3002]] Maybe I should have ordered a smaller size? This shaper is more like a one piece negligee. I didn‚Äôt see or feel any support in the chest, back or tummy. I ordered per size guide to make sure I bought the proper size. The crotch area has a snap. I was able to unsnap easily to go to the bathroom."
3.0,I bought this shirt in pink. I was concerned it would be sized on the small side so I went up a size. I found it to fit big. I ordered a medium and should have got a small which small would have then been large on me. I'm 5'2 and a medium is just way to big. Maybe down the road I'll use it as a maternity shirt.
3.0,"It‚Äôs not very stretchy and somewhat soft and it runs small, I would of ordered 2 sizes up. I prefer my shirts a little bit loose but thought by ordering 1 size up that would of been ok.<br />I also didn‚Äôt like that the arm sleeves were rolled and sewed on that way"
3.0,The over all look is great! Just runs small. Ordered 6-12 month and it basically fits my 4.5 month old perfectly. Will have to order another one.
3.0,It is soft and cozy feeling. The sleeves are a little short.
3.0,Great shirt... style wise.. I'm a XL..so I order an XXL.. still a little small...I followed the size chart... didn't work..
3.0,This product is just OK!  I can take it or leave it.  It's not what I would call a pillow slide.  It's a simi-soft slide & far from a cushiony pillow softness. A quick slide on for getting out of bed & that's it!
3.0,Its very nice but if u sweat alot it turns right away.
3.0,"I specifically searched and bought online for first time, because I have several bras that I bought a long time ago with same brand.  I loved my bras ad wanted the same fit.  I bought two different sizes just to make sure one would fit... neither fit."
3.0,It is not a high end purse and it smelled terrible for the first couple weeks.
3.0,The back of the earring is only black.  Wish it were patterned on both sides.
3.0,"These gloves seemed to shrink very minimally after washing. They fit my five-year-old perfectly, so even though the claimed fit is for 6-12 years old, I‚Äôm hoping these gloves still fit him for this upcoming winter. He is not a large boy by any means. At least we have several pairs in case some get lost."
3.0,Looks super but zipper is a stinker. Zipper blew out. I was able to re-secure but don't trust it to hold up. Shame because it is a good looking bag.
3.0,Took like a long time and it‚Äôs more of a Jersey than a tank.
3.0,"Look good, but unless you shuffle along the floor while wearing them, they will come off"
3.0,I love the style but I ordered red and ended up with purple. Not sure what happened but can't send it back so now I'm stuck with a color I don't like.
3.0,Nice glasses. Too small for my face. Unfortunately I had to give them away to my father in law because they didn't fit
3.0,"The shirt is nice enough, it is just frustrating that it is supposed to be an XL and fits like a M."
3.0,It‚Äôs ok to put over the glasses but can fall eventually from there.
3.0,"I have no idea why so many of these reviews say to size up, my daughter is 10 so I ordered a size bigger and they are huge! Going to have to exchange. Quality seems okay."
3.0,Not the quality I expected. It‚Äôs just an ok skirt not a ‚Äúmost have.‚Äù
3.0,"They‚Äôre very beautiful, but too small."
3.0,"The style itself is really cute, but this runs very large. I normally order tops in a large, but I ordered a medium this time and need to switch to a small. Also this is more like a long sleeve shirt instead of a sweatshirt. It‚Äôs still very cute though."
3.0,Poles are too long and cannot be shortened and can‚Äôt be used properly.
3.0,This is a Christmas requested by my granddaughter. We will not see how it works till Christmas
3.0,"This fit me as expected because I ordered 3 sizes up. I knew it was China size. So I got what I ordered and expected. I am a US Small size and ordered XL. This is a bit loose for me, L might have been perfect, but I can make do with XL. It is very thin see-through material and needs a cami inside for sure. But it is a very pretty blouse , summery and I like it a lot for the pattern and lace at the neck and the price!."
3.0,It was ok. A tad bit see thru and thin material. I purchased this for my daughter whose a Junior in college.
3.0,"Do yourself a favor, and order half a size up. I did, just because any boot with a pointed foot like this can get uncomfortable until it's broken in, and this is no exception. They don't have really any tread either, so fair warning if you're planning to wear them inside at any point. I actually almost slipped just trying them on. To put it plainly- they're nice boots for any fall outfit, and timeless in summer too, they look and feel to be a decent quality, but they're for decoration, and not any real work or wear/tear. I don't have much confidence in how they'll hold up. Which, if just for looks is what you need, then these boots will be perfect after a while, just give yourself the time to break them in before the event you want them for. Perfect for any shindig, but maybe not so much dancing in."
3.0,I liked the shoe but it runs small.  I usually wear a size 8.  I doubt that even an 8 1/2 would have fit.  The color was called pewter but looked more gold to me.  Very soft and comfortable though.  Wish it would have been what I expected.
3.0,"Not great for larger bust sizes; the bottom band eventually rolls up, and it runs a little small. The material isn't super stretchy in order to maintain support. I really wanted to love this bralette, but think that there just isn't a way for a bralette design to work for me."
3.0,It was ok and appropriate for working in cold weather
3.0,"Although military style but not military specs; I was at first disappointed that this was a 2&#34;, and not 1 1/4&#34; web, and the buckle was not what I recall from the service. That said, after several wearings, I find the belt to be very easy to use and comfortable. If it wears well, this item certainly deserves a 5-star rating.<br />Edit: 11-14-18 - After some months using these belts, I find the quality of the metal used on the end tab to be very inferior and easily bent. I've actually removed this cheap 'tin' piece on one of the belts and its easier to get it through pants loops this way. Shoddy material compared to actual military web belt."
3.0,Didn't expect these to be so large.
3.0,"I'm torn between 5 starts and one star... These are excellent quality socks, very comfortable, no bleeding when washing, holds up to frequent washing, and the colors are better than I anticipated.<br />However... they say the cut was made for chucks (which is my footwear 90% of my life). It's true they are cut in that way, but the execution was poor. The socks are too thick to fit under most of my chucks! Most pairs are normal low tops. The extra heel lip would prevent the classic chucks problem of all my socks sliding down into them, but it's just too thick. To use these, I'd have to buy shoes a 1/2 size up from my normal (women's 9) size.<br />I almost always go barefoot under my chucks. I only need socks when I am wearing a brand new pair and still trying to break them in, or for my job as a photographer (as I can fine myself in water often, and with no socks, the wet chucks can cause blisters). Luckily I have 2 pairs of very thin puma socks that are the only ones to stay up in all my chucks! If I could find them on here, I'll insert a link :)<br /><br />They are very very comfy though, and I will be keeping them!"
3.0,"Way too small/tight for U.S.  ,but customer service was able to remedy."
3.0,Expected these to be more rose colored since they are rose quartz. Mine were closer to white. Still like they but expected them to have more pink.
3.0,"It is soft, warm and cozy. But it has a hole. üò≠ I have not contacted the seller, but I will."
3.0,"I really wanted to wear this shirt for my fall beach vacation.  But.  It is too small in the body (unable to button shut), although the sleeves are nice and roomy.  The material is very light weight so would have been perfect on the beach.  I will be returning it."
3.0,Got these for my May baby. The color is closer to peridot than emerald. Good size and look well made
3.0,Minimal support.  Weird cup shape.
3.0,So this is TOTALLY sheer... Not like in the photos... You will need to have something underneath.<br /><br />That being said... Quality not great...  But it's OK. Didn't have high expectations given the price but I was still disappointed.<br /><br />I'll keep it but I'm not wild about it.  It does run small like it said.
3.0,"Update: The return process was very easy & the seller offered to replace the item. I declined, but was very pleased with the quick response.<br /><br />I bought this because I sometimes ride my bike to work & back (16mi total). I was excited that it arrived so fast, but was disappointed to find out that on the highest setting, it doesn't get warm. Especially not as warm as it says. Plus, two or three of the heating pads sewn in don't get warm at all.<br /><br />I like the idea of how adjustable it is, but no heat. Especially not enough to be worth keeping.<br /><br />Super bummed!"
3.0,fits funny. way to large on bottom and really small on top.
3.0,The only reason I didn't like it was the size (too small).
3.0,"My dress has a a small oil-like stain at the waist and the waist hem is uneven with stitching visible on half the dress. I‚Äôm not returning it because got it for 8 dollars and both issues can be covered with a wide belt, which I‚Äôd intended to wear with it anyway. The fabric is also heavier than I was expecting for the price too, so that‚Äôs a bonus. Overall, I do like it.  For anyone with size questions, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 150 pounds with a D cup, I got a medium and like the fit."
3.0,Rubber bottoms
3.0,Fit is not as expected.  A little smaller than i thought it was
3.0,Good quality but way too large. This is my second attempt at purchasing for my 2 year old son who wears size 5 in toddler shoes. The first time I ordered year 4-5 thinking perhaps they meant size instead of year. Those came way too big so I ordered year 3-4 but they look like they can fit a 6-7 year old in my opinion...Here is a picture of the difference compared to a pair of size 5 Childrens Place sandals.
3.0,"These are smaller than anticipated,  but okay."
3.0,"I ended up returning this product... mostly because I found that it had an odd fit for placing multiple items on it.  Also, I found that even when I got the exact right placement of products on it, that it was not ideal for me for placing in my bags/backpacks.  I much prefer to have regular ol pouches and zippered bags to place inside my bags as I feel they are more flexible.<br /><br />I do feel that grid-it's may have it's purposes for specific things like maybe organizing stuff in a glove compartment or in your desk drawer but for travel I didn't find it to provide any benefit over regular travel pouches."
3.0,"Was not as fond of this style as I hoped I would be. The front seems to angle down at a degree that I was not able to see much when I tried it on. Giving 3 stars for this. Quality and versatility are good. I did return the item. I feel that this hat may be better off on someone else‚Äôs head. Not all hats suit everyone, this one did not suit me. I‚Äôm sure others will have no issues."
3.0,It's ok. There was nothing wrong with it. Pretty much what you would expect for the price. The ring is nice and sturdy. More of a man's ring since it's supposed to be Dean's. Overall it was nice.
3.0,The quality is not what I had hoped for. it took a few days of airing out to get the smell of the packing<br />stuff out of the handbag.  I have used it and it is fairly nice looking. But I don't think I would buy another one.
3.0,"I am 5'2 and 100 pounds and ordered the size 0/2. The waist and body fit perfectly! However, the bust was huge! I wore a 32 B push up strapless bra and could not get anywhere near filling it up. The bust was massive and saggy. I had to return the dress."
3.0,"Dainty and very small, I had imagined, it would be a bit bigger in size. It would be a great gift for a young girl or a child. The chain is very small too and difficult to fasten. Overall, the necklace is shiny and the charm is thin."
3.0,This isn't super-flattering on.  It fits oddly and is better suited for yard work than a date.  It's pretty fabric but it fits like a man's shirt.
3.0,bit small but I guess OK to use for my Cannibal Costume/scene I am planning. Could be a childs brain &#62;:)
3.0,"Very waterproof. I'm 5'3"" and the top half just fits length wise. I have the straps as loose as they can go. I had to trim off 2 inches off the legs to keep from walking on them."
3.0,I found the dress to be high waisted and not very flattering on me. The color and design were pretty and the fabric was true summer weight. I returned the dress.
3.0,Definitely runs big. Nice and soft.
3.0,"Really awkward design, strait across face puts a lot of pressure along undereye area/eye sockets."
3.0,"Smaller than advertised, but still were cute."
3.0,"Well.....it is a nicely made winder,  However it is a little noisy.  I'm not sure if it is the acoustics in my bedroom, but I can hear it spin from over 15 ft away at night. Kinda sounds like a diesel truck idling outside the house.  Its not really that bad, but I expected it to be completely silent.  Also I went to put on my Tag Heuer last night, and it was dead.  I have only had it on the first setting (counter-clockwise), so I have changed it to the second setting (clockwise), and hopefully  it works.  Otherwise I will be sending it back."
3.0,definitely runs small and will shrink when you wash it. size up!
3.0,Average quality and runs small.
3.0,Colors were not as vibrant as I expected but it was overall still a decent scarf.
3.0,Really cute but runs small! Order up!
3.0,would be nice if arrived as a gift with a working battery!!!!!
3.0,"Wallet doesn't let me store cards in the very top slot, also has wording on it that looks slightly tacky I wish it was just the bow. Love the Wallet otherwise."
3.0,Pretty but not so easy to use (for me).
3.0,Did not like the quality
3.0,Nice gloves but way to expensive!
3.0,They are nice but not oversized
3.0,"The gray color and fabric are beautiful  The length is perfect too.  However the waist seam and pulls are too high and this makes it unflattering on me, I am 5'6""."
3.0,It's a nice dress up piece and I was able to wear it for part of my Halloween costume but I would not recommend it for someone of my small breasted body type. I could not get it to fit close to my boobs at all. But if your bigger than a size A cup you should be ok.
3.0,This was cute and it didn‚Äôt want to return it but i did because it was just not the color to me what I saw on picture . I didn‚Äôt look good with what wanted to pair it with so it had to go back. Had it been the right color I would have kept it.
3.0,"Fits as expected, decent quality worth the price!"
3.0,This skirt is cute but the material is more of a satin plastic type of material and I did not like that. Beware that when purchasing this item it‚Äôs cut small. I usually wear a med I got a large and it‚Äôs still tight so choose wisely
3.0,"Very lightweight, almost see through. I ordered an xl and it was more like a medium."
3.0,Great print but fading away fast with just a couple of  washes.
3.0,"I read that these run small, they shrink, get a larger size. Hoping that it will shrink. It is too big. The color is much lighter than the picture - almost a light powder color."
3.0,Nice quality but size runs small.
3.0,"I KEPT THEM, BUT THEY WERE NOT ROUND; I HAD TO SORT OF RE-SHAPE THEM"
3.0,Texture is great but they run small.
3.0,The fit is true to size. The material is on the thicker side and doesn‚Äôt breathe well. The tie shown in the picture isn‚Äôt attached to the shirt in any way so it doesn‚Äôt stay put. Will be returning.
3.0,Shipping was very long!!! Item runs very small!!
3.0,"The price of $25 was high for a beanie hat.  Gloves included would have been nice.  It is pretty and I thought my granddaughter would have loved it.  She asked, ‚Äúwhere are the gloves?‚Äù"
3.0,Even though the print on the lanyard is beautiful and great quality the clip that is holding on for keys or ID it‚Äôs not so great and in quality but has been replaced easily with another hook.
3.0,Not for me. Kinda looked like a costume on me
3.0,"These fit fine, but offer no support whatsoever. I'm keeping them to wear over my bra under some sheer tops or just around the house."
3.0,A little too thick but i like that is long
3.0,"Purchased a size small and it is very baggy. I believe this dress style runs bigger and suggest that you size down. Also, the material is a bit thin and more see through than I prefer. Would be better with leggings underneath. The print is super cute though."
3.0,"Not as long as appears in picture. I'm very tall and like hip long shirts. However, I gave it to my sister and it fit her perfectly."
3.0,"I was excited to try this product.  I like the concept of it - not having a bulging belt buckle showing under shirts.  It did work as promised, but I just didn't feel like my pants were secure.  I still prefer the security of a traditional belt holding my pants against my body, so unfortunately I did return mine.  I still like the idea of it and am sad it didn't work out for me."
3.0,peplum top fits a little large but I know how to sew so will be taking it in...
3.0,I wasn't aware the PS4 came in a slim edition I ordered this when i ordered my sons PS4. Found out his PS4 was a slim when it got here. Needless to say I put it on my PS4 which is the bigger version. Really nice material. Wish it would state it's not for the slim and vise versa.
3.0,They are pretty and everything but won't stay in place
3.0,"Looked for a less expensive replacement for some Teva Hurricanes. The inner sole of  Karrimor Mens Antibes is suppose to be shaped&lt; i guess like your foot, but not mine. They use a harder inner sole that teva and it's shaped unlike my foot. I little irritating... Found a pair of Tevas on clearance, in my size, last pair in store online for $20. Happy again."
3.0,Very cute pattern. Would suggest a belt to go with it if you don't look good in the style of dress.
3.0,Ordered XL and they are very small
3.0,"I took pink,but it was not looking as expected when I wore , Blue might be more beautiful.."
3.0,"These durags are over priced. Why are they over priced? The durags are the same type of durags found in the dollar store, just with a slightly longer tie. The wave cap is too big and oddly shaped. For this price, Amazon has better durags and for a wave cap the ""boo-boo"" wave caps are better. Buy if durags aren't in your area but if they are, just go to the dollar store or walmart."
3.0,The slit was up to my bikini line. I‚Äôm 5 feet tall and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable wearing this dress to a wedding. It might be better for a Girls night out or homecoming dance for a teenager.
3.0,more of a brownish color than rust
3.0,Nice color. A little thin.
3.0,"way to small, and very very short"
3.0,The top fit perfectly. The bottoms were way too small; like two sizes too small. And it isn't a halter style top. A halter style ties behind the neck. This ties at the bra strap area in the back.
3.0,Very cute a good quality could not use because the color was hot pink not red as ordered.
3.0,Quality good but actually for a size 6 through maybe a small 10. Very small..... not as listed. The length includes the length of the ties. Misleading.
3.0,The product definitely gives you a waist line‚Ä¶but NOT a flatten tummy like the videos..if you have a tummy it will NOT SUCK YOU IN..you will get the smooth firm look thats it
3.0,These are cute but got pils pretty fast.
3.0,Very pretty! Broke easily üòû
3.0,I normally wear mediums and even checked my measurements against the sizing charts provided but a medium is definitely too small for me because if my chest. If you‚Äôre busty definitely go a size or even two sizes up! I was somehow magically able to get the dress on and zipped up but forget about breathing lol
3.0,"I wear a size 3 or size 26 in jeans and I'm 130 LBS. I bought the small and they are a little tight. I can still wear them but a medium would of fit better. Also the button is loose so your getting what you paid for, cheaply made!!"
3.0,These are good but not great more silver than diamond. The pictures do not really represent.
3.0,"They are a bit tight as the ear pieces are on my head, but they look pretty good. The color though is not what is on the picture for the lens. Its a darker more purple and blue lens."
3.0,"The size runs very small.......can't even wear it. Nice shirt, too bad I can't use it."
3.0,"Not so good quality, it lays awkward on my toddler too."
3.0,The coat had a light brown streak on the back of it and the buttons were not fastened on securely. Wish it was better quality.
3.0,Was disappointed that I couldn't adjust the strap and after a week the zipper got stuck.  It is very lightweight & great compartment that makes it easy to kept stuff organized
3.0,I really wanted to like this but I was sent another jersey in another color. Not what was pictured.
3.0,Ok bag.
3.0,Somewhat small but it really cute.  I am losing weight so I will keep it.  I bought another jacket from a different retailer in the same size and it fit perfectly.  Both were ordered one size above my shirt size.
3.0,Look very cheap and the hearts should be coordinated so they directionally match when wearing. Do love the hooks.
3.0,Comfortable. Mild compression.
3.0,I bought the biggest size and still is to small for my 11 yd old son.
3.0,Cute but finger will turn green
3.0,"I loved the shirt and have only worn it a handful of times. However, there was a weird seem, or previous tag, or a hole that had been previously down on the back and now it has burst open. It looks like someone previously tried to hide it and it burst open."
3.0,They stretch out immediately after putting them on and then offer very limited thigh support. Good for tummy but I needed them for thigh area.
3.0,"The leather, if it is real, got a surface cut the first day I got them and the cut went all the way through. Also the stitching for the fabric on the inside of the glove is very sloppy"
3.0,"Being 5'2, I found the waist belt to be positioned rather high on my body and was going to return both of the ones I ordered (I got two Smalls - one in &#34;Royal Blue&#34; and one in &#34;Bright Red&#34;) as I got one as a gift for a friend who is 5'7. I thought she would find the belt to be too high up, but she was actually quite comfortable in it and felt it was more fitting for the style. I knew it wouldn't have pockets so I can't really mark it down for that, but just be aware that they don't. It's not the most well made robe but it's fine. I would say it's more form fitting - not that it's tight, it's just not a super drapey robe (those tend to feel more luxurious) - so size up if that's what you're going for."
3.0,"I guess I was expecting something more like a swarovski crystal. The material is nowhere near that quality. Feels very light like plastic and not very sparkly. Note that you do NOT get the chain. Bottom line, the pendant is wearable (and the price is a low), but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"This is an adorable little necklace. I bought two as gifts. One I ended up not giving because the chain was all knotted up when it came, and because it is a really delicate chain I couldn't get the knot out. I ordered some necklaces from another company and they came in boxes so there were no knots, versus these necklaces that were in teeny tiny pouches so they were completely bunched up."
3.0,"5'3, 120 lbs. Was flooded in this. Way too big. Also had a bit of a weird smell but I imagine that would dissipate. Was pretty though."
3.0,Promt shipping good quality but the size runs a little big
3.0,"First, as others have stated, I too received this product broken.  I liked the necklace so much though, that I wanted to keep it and made the attempt to repair it.  It took me a few minutes, but I was able to put the necklace together with the help of needle-nose pliers.  That's the problem though...I didn't buy this with the intention of having to repair it.  If you're going to sell a damaged product, at least note that, and lower your price (not that this is expensive).<br /><br />Overall, the necklace is very nice, I got compliments on it as I was putting it back together (LOL!).<br /><br />I am very hesitant though about buying from this seller again."
3.0,"Very thick and relatively comfortable. Wanted to use for compression during travel, not crazy rolling down when you sit, but it does roll a little. I'm 5'10&#34; and 10/12 and these do cover most of my torso."
3.0,pero con mucha pelusas
3.0,Shorter then what I expected and they are see through. Runs a size to small
3.0,The color is much lighter/faded than shown in the product image. Not enough stuffing so the tail doesn‚Äôt look as full. The fur on the tail and ears is very thin ‚Äî would not recommend brushing the tail as it may rip the fur strands.
3.0,"Nice ooking but had to return it because it says ""Women Men"" heated vest....we ordered an XL, but it did not fit a normal ""Men's"" XL...but did not indicate it was a unisize."
3.0,"These fit OK.  I think &#34;One Size&#34; fits all is a little over-the-top and somewhat misleading.  They work, but if were a size 18 I would think twice about getting them.  Other than that, they are very soft and comfortable to wear."
3.0,Big on me.
3.0,So small you can't tell it's a heart
3.0,"I purchased Demon Slayer Tanjiro earrings for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I don't like leaving negative reviews but I gotta be honest. So my daughter earrings were just too hard to clip on, I was struggle to clip them on both of our earlobes. After struggle to put these earrings on, we're-like-yes-there-on but they would just slide right off. So either these earrings are for people with small earlobes or we received a broken set. Anyways, I'm not going to return Tanjiro earrings because my daughter still likes them. I will probably place them on my daughter backpack as an accessory. lol"
3.0,Super beautiful.  Down side is they do not stay in place. They turn a lot so I'm constantly having to fix the position of it.
3.0,It's ok but the adages a blunt cut and rough . Leather is medium thickness. Really just a fair quality item.
3.0,Cute fall off easily ok product..
3.0,"We originally purchase a pair of this and didn‚Äôt last but 3 months, of course we though, ok our fault! Maybe we ripped the front by being on our knees to long, and maybe it unglued it self due to...umm idk. So we order again, and said let‚Äôs be more careful this time and swap up every other day with another paid of shoes... but nop, same results. Ripped and unglued bottoms within 3 months!<br />Thanks, but NEXT!"
3.0,"One lense is darker than the other, it messes with your eyes when wearing them.<br />2nd pair they sent had the correct lense tint on both sides but the reflective coating started flaking off after one week of wear and proper cleaning. Now they want me to go to (not my preferred khols)  UPS to return them, they won't even send out a replacement (like they did with the first pair AND let me return at khols) exchange smh..."
3.0,Band is losing its magnetic power a bit.
3.0,Recommend sizing up a couple of sizes
3.0,They are comfortable and cute but when walking around the house you whole foot and slide forward. I have slim narrow feet and long toes so my feet look like it‚Äôs griping the front when they slide forward. Other than that it‚Äôs comfortable!
3.0,I really liked the watch band but had to return it as it was huge and couldn‚Äôt remove links. I even measured my wrist before I ordered!!  Sad.
3.0,"Item appears to be decent material, but image is kind of blurry.  It fit kind of tight for a normal grown up, better fit on a teen probably.  The shipping time was excessive even if coming from china. And don't even bother with the tracking number it was pointless and never updated."
3.0,"I‚Äôm a 32B/C and the top doesn‚Äôt fit as hoped.  Doubt I‚Äôll wear it at all, but if I do, I‚Äôll have to wear a sports bra underneath,"
3.0,"Runs a size smaller (at least on larger sizes). Thin material, but a nice quality print of the image."
3.0,Not as it realy looks .it has more silver than the black.in portion.
3.0,This dress is an awkward design and I have only started to wear it as a maternity dress now that I am pregnant as it didn‚Äôt fit right as a non-maternity dress.
3.0,very small pair of glasses.  small bridge for nose.
3.0,No es de la calidad que esperaba
3.0,I have a small head & the band still left marks on my forehead.
3.0,Its beautiful but i was a little shocked to see how big the hole for the chain was.
3.0,Very short for a 90th % 7 year old.  Doesn't even come to mid-thigh.
3.0,"The Shirt is soft and long, but not the color it is shown as, it is a pale baby blue and solid, not ombre dyed"
3.0,It fit the Apple Watch but was way too big for my wife‚Äôs wrist.
3.0,Color was exactly as expected but sizing seemed off. This shirt was an inch smaller and an inch shorter that others I‚Äôve gotten in the same style and size.
3.0,"Be advised, the 12‚Äù is overall length, not inseam."
3.0,"I bought these for my 6 yo and 9 yo, and within 1 week, one kid had holes and the other was missing the back strap."
3.0,"It's nice and light, but flimsy and not the easiest to carry when its full. Not a great day-to-day bag but good as a backup extra space stored in the main luggage to give room for souvenirs/shopping."
3.0,I don't like how the balls on the end that screw on keep breaking I just got them and I'm on number 3 already
3.0,"I like the way these socks grip our wood floors. They are comfortable, I was worried about the little bumps but can't feel them at all. My only problem is they twist a little bit and the non-slip part ends on the side of my foot."
3.0,It fit as expected but wasnt very flattering. Might be my body type with the fabric.... but I didnt love it.
3.0,Silver clasp discolored after a few days (plastic not metal).  Fits and works as a cheap replacement band.
3.0,"I like the dress and the pattern but ended up returning, kinda has that squishy material ish so wasn‚Äôt a fan of that"
3.0,The glasses (2x) are very affordable.  And I love the style.  I get a lot of compliments from my family.  They do block the blue lights when you use the supplied test kit.  But I had to return them because they do not fit my face.  I really want to keep them and it was a hard decision to return though!
3.0,"Fit, material is extremely thin and cheaply manufactured"
3.0,Not as good quality as I had expected. I bought this for my husband and he liked the item but I think it looks a little cheap.
3.0,Not what I ordered!!! Don't get me wrong I like it but I wanted the one with the balloon from IT in it. If they were out could have let me known first.
3.0,Love the jacket BUT these are basically child sizes. The medium is really like an extra small. I just ordered a replacement in large. Fingers crossed.
3.0,"This brand runs extremely small! Cute suit, I love the style and colors.  It is the same style as my TYR swimsuit, but way cheaper.  The problem is it runs really, really small, like at least 2 sizes too small.  When I ordered it again 2 sizes larger, part of the suit fit and part was still too tight.  I am a size 8 and the 12 still did not fit nicely."
3.0,"Other than the chain, it's pretty to look at and tote around in."
3.0,Nice fit but lettering is crooked
3.0,It'll work...
3.0,"Cute, but looked bad on me in person. The company was helpful with returning it and getting me a refund."
3.0,"Stiff, formal, appropriate. Nicely constructed, imported from Asia, arrived as described. Look closely, that's all! (I like a chic bag that I can wear with designer stuff or with my worn tee/cardigan/jeans...I don't think this bag has that versatile, fun, glamorous touch which works well with both.) It's not a bag I will carry. I am keeping it, though, just in case."
3.0,"I do not remember if it gave the size, but it was much smaller than I thought.  Fortunately it was for my two young grandaughters and they are as happy as can be."
3.0,nothing like in the picture
3.0,"The hat is nice and fits well, but the embroidery began unraveling after a month or so and the clasp on the back fell off soon after."
3.0,"I think the glasses are adorable, they seem to be great quality. The cases and cleaning cloth are very nice. Sadly they are what I would think of as kid sized, but more baby sized."
3.0,"Nice but not very good for money!  The top as well as both sides and bottom are fully sewed closed, while the top of most wallets are open for cash  folders, NOT so here.  There are two places you can put bills if you fold them in half, but that is not very convenient. One place is under the credit cards and the other is behind them. with just a little more effort this could have been a 5 star wallet.<br /><br />Pro: Even with cash, credit cards, and passport it is still relatively slim.<br /><br />Other cons:  only 5 slots for credit cards, but you can double up and it will hold ten that way.  It is a tight fit, but it can be done.<br />The passport will fit, but once again, it is tight. I put min in with the page out to my ID section for easy access."
3.0,"Hubby has very lean legs and these fit almost snug, a complete first. Consider sizing up one size."
3.0,"This one looks nice, but it doesn't slide right.  Gets tangled on itself easily."
3.0,"I usually wear a dress size 6 but I'm busty so I ordered a medium. It was too big, way too big. I'm returning it. Had it been the right size I suspect I would still be returning it. The photos show the waist band around the waist but mine sits different, giving it a bit of a maternity look."
3.0,Fit weirdly around my chest and the ruffles are a bit too much. I like the adjustable straps though. Pretty cute
3.0,bought for grandson.  Too big
3.0,Wish would use regular hat sizes
3.0,I love this style and color but it is too small and hurts my head. I have a fairly small head too and have to use the smallest setting on baseball caps so they don't fall off
3.0,"This does cut down on the glare when I am driving in the early hours of the morning, but really nothing<br />to rave about.  I would rather have a pair for function and not necessarily ""Hot Fashion""  No one sees me<br />when it's dark out when I'm driving!"
3.0,"The wond is plastic and it breaks easily. When I got it, the wond it was bent. But the glasses, necklace, and scarf was great for my daughter."
3.0,Too thin & small. They unthreaded rather quickly too. would pass<br /><br />Only positive is they‚Äôre an ‚Äúofficially licensed‚Äù product of that matters to you
3.0,"I wear 2X clothing, but I was looking for something more comfortable than traditional style bras, so I ordered the 3X.<br /><br />These are crazy tight. Not snug tight, but corrected my posture like a full on back brace, tight.  My friends laughed their butts off when I tried the first one on!<br /><br />I did stick with one long enough to stretch it out.  It took approx 3-5 days.  I'm happy now.  Happy for the boob support and happy for my much improved posture.<br /><br />Basically, you must decide which is worse, shallow breathing for 3-5 days or repackaging them for return.  It's a 50/50.  Any gal who is plus sized will know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />So while they are very well made, they are sized small...buy a size up or DIET NOW!<br /><br />(I'd submit a pic, but lets be honest...ain't nobody wanna to see that!!!)"
3.0,"The color shows the dress as navy blue but, in reality, it's much darker; almost black. Additionally, this was a shirt/skirt combo and not a dress. The shirt keeps coming untucked from the dress and doesn't look all that good."
3.0,"This dress is cute and comfortable however poorly made. I feel it is over priced and I do not like the seam in the front as the polka dots don't match up. I do like the pockets and the adjustable straps. I'm 5'2"" and weigh 160 and ordered a Medium."
3.0,Comfortable but not the kind that tucks in your belly..
3.0,The dress came wrinkled and needs some adjustments.
3.0,Very tight. Too small.
3.0,weird shape to the hat
3.0,Rubbed my little ones heel returned and got natives instead
3.0,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY STRETCH BELT, BUT THE SIZING IS INACCURATE. GAVE THIS ONE TO A FRIEND AS IT RAN EXTREMELY SHORT IN LENGTH.<br /> WILL ORDER ANOTHER ONE, ONLY THE NEXT SIZE LARGER...."
3.0,The chest area was much larger than expected and I'm heavy chested so that says a lot. Love the style and color however.
3.0,"Ordering a men's small I thought would be rather large on my 12 year old.  However, this shirt runs small so I will be ordering men's medium instead."
3.0,Pants ripped in the crotch after one wear. Super cute outfit though.
3.0,"The fabric is a little cheap feeling.  I'll probably still use it, but the fabric in a little more expensive organizers feels a little better."
3.0,Its nice but just too big. I‚Äôm keeping it because I can make it work.
3.0,If it had a pocket for the filter to hide it willbe perfect
3.0,"Bought an XL for myself, fits my 10 year old daughter who is an XS or S. Runs VERY small. But cute and decent quality so she gets to keep it."
3.0,"Nice size and design, rather thin metal.  Look inexpensive."
3.0,"This dress wasn‚Äôt quite what I expected. It had a lot of tan in it, and though it looks black, it is navy. I bought a lavender cardigan to go with this and the tan washes the cardigan out. I think the cardigan I ordered was more of a blush color instead of a lavender and I have learned that true lavender is hard to find. If you buy a cardigan to go with it I suggest a darker purple or maybe a navy color.  Maybe even white. I bought this for a wedding and I ended up having to order another dress because the colors in this just do not work. The length is great and the fit is good, the waist is a bit high but it usually is on a maxi. I will wear this, but I have to get a new cardigan to go with it."
3.0,Love them but got smaller over time/washes
3.0,I really like this jacket but I gave it a three stars because the pocket lining on both side rip and created a huge holes. it a nice jacket except for the inner lining material.
3.0,"I received size large pants (the size I ordered) and an extra large jacket.  I purchased this a part of a gift and didn't have time to wait for an exchange. Quality seems fair, though I'm  not sure I would have given it even in the correct size."
3.0,"The bottom part is great, but the top part kind of looks bulky."
3.0,Size runs small and very narrow had to return
3.0,"Obviously cheap quality, but it looks great! Definitely order 1 or 2 sizes bigger."
3.0,It‚Äôs definitely very thin and very lightweight.<br />I don‚Äôt hate it but I definitely don‚Äôt love it. It feels like it will break very easily. I‚Äôm wearing it today and it‚Äôs definitely shiny and catches the light and sparkles. I this is more of costume jewelry or a necklace for a teenager rather than an adult.
3.0,"I've had this watch for 24 hours and this is what I can tell you: This watch is comfortable on the wrist, beautiful to look at, and works. The only problem is what other reviewers have noted as well; the &#34;gold&#34; on the watch is way more yellow than rose as the picture would have you believe. The dial however is the same color as appears in the picture. It looks as if they used two different materials for the gold section."
3.0,"Really like the style, and I know it is meant to be worn with a collar shirt under but the neckline is super big."
3.0,Overall a good blanket scarf. I bought two and they both came with a really bad factory chemical smell however after I washed them it went away. I do find threads coming out of it every time i wear it (which is not often)
3.0,I like the shirts but I recommend getting a size larger than you would normally wear as the chest and length are tight and short.  They are very thin which works great for me as I live in the south.  The price was good but many picky shoppers may be unhappy.
3.0,"This Prana Katya is a beautiful well made shirt. The fabric and stitching is quality. I am very pleased that it seems to be pre-shrunk because although it fits in every other way, it is slightly tight across the back at just below shoulder height.  I was injured a few years ago, broke my back, and this has kept me away from the gym, so I have 15 pounds and 3 sizes to lose. Hoping to eventually get back to exercising and take care of this issue. Meanwhile I shall be washing this in cold water and hanging it to dry."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. It's nice and sexy but not amazing. It's not disappointing but again it was only about $8.00, so what can you say."
3.0,"Love the romper. I use it as a bathing suit, but it was a little smaller than I thought it would be"
3.0,"look like nice slacks, however they run really small.  The XXL is probably only about a ladies 12-14"
3.0,"Like them, not heavy @ all should have purchased bigger size"
3.0,"I haven't used any of the items yet.  They all look to be of very good quality, except the &#34;swim cap&#34;.  It's described as a &#34;leak proof swim cap&#34;.  I wouldn't consider it a swim cap, and it certainly isn't leak proof.  The cap is made of a nylon material that is pretty thin.  I will report back after/IF I use it."
3.0,"Did not like how it was shipped, the hat is smashed, don‚Äôt know if I can get the shape I like on the brim."
3.0,A little difficult to close
3.0,"I was under the impression this was organic, but the label only reads &quot;95% Cotton 5% spandex.&quot; After inquiring about it I was assured that it was organic- but I have a hard time taking someone's word for it when nowhere on the label or the actual tank does it actually say that it's organic cotton, especially since I've read under the questions that some labels on the tanks people order do specify organic cotton. I try to only buy organic cotton and this is why this tank doesn't get 5 stars...that's what labels are for, right?"
3.0,Too small for female nipples
3.0,"So much fun, but they‚Äôre see through"
3.0,Velcro hurts my foot.
3.0,"Sleeves too short, fits a little large, and not very long for a woman who's only 5'71/2.&#34; Very well-made. Extremely elegant. Just a little disappointed about the fit."
3.0,"Hmmm, don‚Äôt know what to say. I purchased a XS size. I got a S size. Didn‚Äôt want to request a change, so, I kept."
3.0,"First impression after opening package was the smell ... terrible. BUT, after washing before wearing, the smell was gone. The material is quite thin, which I just didn't expect. The shirt looks nice, but the photo of it is a bit misleading as it is not as long as pictured unless you are very short ( I am 5ft. 3in.) but it hangs barely past my hipline, so it is considerably shorter than I expected. The sleeves are made of a sweater type material which differs from the fabric of the body of the shirt & are a bit snug. But I am keeping it & the others purchased from this same manufacturer/seller. I give it a 3 star rating ... not the best, but I have bought worse items online."
3.0,I got a new watch that I really bike and I would have had to replace the band because when I took it out of the box I've broke the clasp when I removed the tag it was a goodbye so I did not want to bring it back so I was able to get a clasp and fix it that way the only problem was it did not include a tool to put the clasp on which made it a little more difficult furniture today
3.0,I wanted to get the Oberm slippers that you see when you search for the item which have a small back on them.  I did not realize that certain sizes (larger ones?) completely change to another brand and style with no back at all (slip-ons).  I did not realize this when I ordered and now have to return them for something with a back.<br /><br />I'm giving 3 stars because of this - the slippers are nice enough but having a product vary depending on size is misleading.
3.0,Quality of the material not the greatest.
3.0,with some alterations from a tailor it fits good. I recommend ordering one size up and having it tailored to fit as it seemed to be slightly smaller than expected (not much) but my tailor was able to work magic. great design though
3.0,Pretty but always smudged
3.0,"I liked this necklace when I saw it in the picture, but in person, not so much.<br /><br />First, the chains that are hanging down are what first attracted me. However, with my necklace the chains are unevenly placed which makes it look kind of funny.<br /><br />Second, the cord that the beads and chains hang from is a bright blue and...almost yarn like and the yarns snags easily. If you look closely at the pictures on the left, specifically the last one, (up top, next to the item), you can see a snag in it.<br /><br />Lastly, if you accidentally drop it while trying to put it on, good luck, because everything slides off the necklace and all over the floor. There's no knot or anything to prevent that from happening. (However, this makes it easy for me to rearrange the chains that hang down, so that they look more even.)<br /><br />Overall, it's okay and I'll probably wear it, if I can get it on without dropping it."
3.0,This has the slit on the side so it shows a bit of the thigh.  It is a bit tighter than the other dresses from the company but that is the style.  My only concern is the washing.  I will update that after I run it through a few hand washes.
3.0,In fear of it being too big I ordered down a size a medium  I should of gotten a large or possibly a X-large as I am 511 155.  But none the less it's a beautiful garment  will be returning to get larger size
3.0,Polyester material makes it too hot to wear in the summer time a little sheer and pants are really wide leg and long must wear heels.
3.0,I love the feel and look of the product but I am missing a couple pieces to my 12mm set (size bigger than double zero... now I have to order the size separately.. that s the only thing disappointing to the set is missing pieces! Other wise the box is beautiful!
3.0,Nothing extraordinarily but fine product
3.0,Good material. Strings weren‚Äôt long enough to loosen. The top felt very tight on.
3.0,"Green isn't as pictured...more of an olive than a dark real/spruce. Fit is ok, gonna keep for a few days to decide whether or not to send back."
3.0,"I like the look of it. When I ordered a large I thought it would be more full since I wear a medium usually. And it is itchy. Have washed it several times with softener, still itchy. Felt I couldn‚Äôt return it after washing it the first time."
3.0,"This is an elegant wristband that resembles the band on my Casio G-shock watch. I also chose it because I don't like strap buckle clasps. After six months the folding clasp failed and no longer holds the band in place. Although it was sold by a third-party, it was fulfilled by Amazon, and Amazon refunded my money after I contacted them about the problem. If you do get it, be very careful with the tool that adds or removes the links. The pin bends easily, rendering it useless. The supplier is responsive, and when this happened to me I received an immediate replacement."
3.0,Awesome look but a lil snug and lenses don‚Äôt fit right
3.0,"My daughter only wore them once and they are already coming apart.  They feel weird also. not soft like leggings, but more like plastic. weird.  I ordered another pair from this brand but they were nicer."
3.0,"I own and wear several sets of compression socks because I get restless legs at night. I‚Äôm not too fussy about what they look like because no one except my husband sees them! But these black and pink ones have a modern design. Unfortunately, these socks are not for me. I ordered the biggest size (L/XL) and they are too tight around the top of my calves at the sock opening. These come up higher than my other pairs so would be good for taller people with less wide calves. I am a 8-10 pant size and these are just too tight and cut off my circulation very quickly. I had to take them off within 30 minutes because they were too uncomfortable."
3.0,"Quality was as expected.  The white definitely has a bluish tinge, so if you are expecting bright white you‚Äôll be disappointed."
3.0,It‚Äôs not worth the money and does not inflate. My child cannot breath in it either.  We will be returning it.<br /><br />Edit - I am changing this to three stars because of costumer service which is great.  They really make an effort to work with the customer which is greatly appreciated.  They refunded the costume and said they would work on their product so hopefully they have found a version of this costume to sell that is worth the price.
3.0,"This jacket ran at least two sizes too small and it‚Äôs probably more a woman‚Äôs style since the zipper is opposite of what it would be for a manks clothing item. Other than that it looks well-made, love the zip off sleeves concept, it was a gift for my husband and he‚Äôs happy with it. Love the bright color so that he is visible when we‚Äôre riding our bikes."
3.0,Pretty cool product. As I‚Äôve seen other reviews the time stone is definitely yellow in this product. You can see places where the glue is visible that‚Äôs holding it together. A little pricey for what I got but it‚Äôs pretty cool.
3.0,"They aren't too large length-wise, but they are too large in width and I don't have a narrow foot. They are nice and fuzzy so I like that but they feel like they are going to fall off. The bottoms are a thicker shoe-like sole and that is strangely narrow. You feel it when you walk so expect your foot to be very slightly wobbly. As I break them in they feel better. They'll do for the price and like I said, they're nice and fuzzy. I would greatly appreciate it if you would mark my review helpful, as I hope this helped!"
3.0,"Zipper is cheap, never heard back from seller, I was hopping to get an exchange but still no word :("
3.0,"Cute keychain. I'd give it 5 stars, however, I only received one keychain when the description says two. Other than that, the product is as described. I received the keychain with Dory only, just like the one in the picture."
3.0,"Last min costume, I wanted to do something fun and within a good price range and came across this! Great material and the fan is not cheap-feeling! I'm laying it out to get some wrinkles out of it but overall the quality is great and I can't wait to have my friends over for some great laughs! The order came quickly as promised and the package had no damage!<br /><br />Update: I used it at the party and I went through 8- AA Batteries. within a 4-hour time frame. I'm going to try and buy the rechargable AA batteries to trade them out."
3.0,loose speakers hard to adjust for optimum sound
3.0,Charm broke off within a day.  Was a nice charm though and thought it looked pretty.
3.0,"This suit fit true to size however, the photo looked like the color was more of a lilac and when I opened the package it was purple. Too dark for my liking."
3.0,"Material is super lightweight, slinky, not linen or cotton."
3.0,They are very thin.
3.0,Fits true to size. The top doesn't support very well if you are big chested but would be fine to lounge around the pool area with or sun bathe. A little complicated to figure out how to get the top on but was very happy with the bottoms. Overall cute suit.
3.0,i found the ring to be a disappointment; it was not as good quality as i expected.
3.0,not good quality lace. the seems aren‚Äôt good and it does not flow out like the photo. pretty color
3.0,"I really like this swimsuit because it covers, but is also cute, light weight, and just as the picture shows. The size is true to fit, I had no problem with the sizing and I wear a large. However, while in the pool I felt the swimsuit snag a little bit if I rubbed up against the wall, that was disappointing to feel the little bumps and snags on the material from the pool, but overall I still like it. Good product for the price,  I would by it again."
3.0,"warm, cute, only 3 starts because they don't stay on baby foot, they come off easy"
3.0,My mother‚Äôs broke the first time she wore it. Could glue it again I guess but it broke during my shower. I liked that there was one for my mom and once for my MIL and they looked the same.
3.0,"These are very cute, fun and comfy.  However, on me, the crotch area is long and does not fit, I constantly felt like I had to pull up on the pants.  Example, if I were to do a standing straddle forward fold, there was a 3"" gap between body and pants. The last thing I want to do is fuss with clothing while focusing on training."
3.0,"too loo long, don't care for high waist ed band."
3.0,the lace veil front dose cover your eyes .it is also clearly just hot glued into place .
3.0,The construction is not the best... but i cant complain for the price
3.0,This is a nicely made purse insert. Lots of pockets and zippers. Perfect for the roomy purse that needs some organization to find items in it.
3.0,My daughter says the coat is ok..I thought it would be thicker
3.0,The pocket and arm patches are very thin material that look like a child attached them. Not very nice at all!
3.0,A little to then.
3.0,"It runs a little small,but its super soft. Love the material. If in doubt, especially since its to sleep in, I recommended a size bigger. The shorts fit more true to size I thought than the shirt did.I don't like anything tight around my belly or chest, and this fit just a little too tight. But comfy!!!!"
3.0,My dress had a stain some type of oil stain in the front.
3.0,Cute but was missing one
3.0,Necklace and chain are decent quality but my pendant showed up missing the spikes of hair shown on the right side of the wolf face.
3.0,"Must return, overall it‚Äôs too small. I ordered size based on reviews. Neck is too tight. Good quality tho."
3.0,Because I love Shoe Jewelry
3.0,It was a little longer than expected and definitely for someone with a B cup size or smaller. Cute but sent back
3.0,"Not constructed particularly well. Serviceable, but don't expect too much of it. It's roomy. The round rubber patch on that pocket flap is ugly but it's only sewn on so was easy to carefully remove. I thought the pockets at either side would accommodate at least 1 water bottle. They narrow at the top so no bottle would fit.  Hard to say what they're for.  I would not buy another of these and would only recommend to a friend if I was detailed in my opinion and knew exactly how the friend might use it.  I believe it is over priced."
3.0,"I absolutely love the design of this purse. I prefer a smaller handbag - this is not too large, but has a surprising amount of space inside. I can even fit my kindle in it, along with the other items I carry. I took off 2 stars because the zippers are really low quality. A couple of them get stuck and the one on the back often separates, so I can't really use that section for fear of my items falling out (this would have been a perfect place to carry a phone). Also, the zipper pulls are on the small side and difficult to grasp. If the zipper issue was corrected this would be the perfect purse for me."
3.0,a bit shorter in length then the other NATO straps I purchased.
3.0,"I had another cheap Casio that I really liked. After a year or two the strap buckle broke, so I got this one...not the same. It's not as comfortable for some reason and the light is horrible. I am very, very disappointed with this light."
3.0,The size i ordered fit good and the shorts themselves were comfortable but the inner padded shorts were something to be desired.<br /><br />Although they were just ok I felt the seams were what I was feeling more than anything making it a little uncomfortable to have all<br /><br />I felt the padding could have been better and could have been a little bigger to actually cover more
3.0,Only holds one card.
3.0,I bought the frames because I liked the light blue speckles. When they arrived there was no blue in the frames just Brown and clear.
3.0,"I will be returning this product. I tried ordering a large and for some reason a XL was what ended up being delivered. I'm 6 feet tall, about 180 lbs, and a size 10-12 and this dress, while definitely long enough for my height (YAY!) was way too large on my frame. I expected it to be loose, but the dress looked shapeless and bag-like. I was also disappointed in the color, which I thought would be a more purple-y blue based on the pictures, but is actually a very deep midnight blue in person. It's still pretty, just not what I was expecting. I will be returning this item, and I thought about getting it in a smaller size (i could probably fit into a medium tbh) but it was for a costume and I found another dress that will work well.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice dress, just not for me. As a tall girl, I definitely recommend this product as it is hard to buy dresses anytime, especially online. If you are a plus sized girl, the XL would fit you great! Based on how it fit me, I think this size could fit anywhere from a size 14 to 18 and maybe even 20 depending on how you want it to look."
3.0,I wear a 40c but I should have bought an XL instead of L. The colors were good. As tight as it was I didn‚Äôt need the eye and hooks. Of course I may not be getting them the right way too. ü§®. Overall not much better than my $12 one from Walmart I bought in a pinch.
3.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I ordered a medium and Amazon sent me a small! The product itself seems nice and warm but I gave it two stars because of the size!
3.0,The colored beads are kinda cheap looking.  It's an okay product but more for a child than an adult.
3.0,It's smaller than it looks in the picture. Cute for a kid. Too small for an adult.
3.0,They definitely run on the small side
3.0,A little surprised that it is so very itchy.
3.0,"Larger than expected and material is very thin. However, it is a nice item. My son will grow into it in no time as all."
3.0,I normally wear a medium and got this in a medium.<br />This bra dug into my shoulders so bad it hurt and left marks after wearing for just a little time.<br />The bra is cute and I think if I got it a size up it would be better.
3.0,"Great seller but the product is not so great.  It arrived all together in a box, none of them individually wrapped.  So, it looks like they slid around & scratched each other up...can't really see out of the lenses too well.  Some seem to be curved away from the face.  Also, we did not get an equal amount of the colors.  Out of 18 glasses, we got 1 pink, 2 blue, 6 green, & 9 yellow.  Cute, inexpensive gift to give out at a birthday party, but you do not get to enjoy them."
3.0,Fits small. I read reviews and sized up. Normally wear a medium and large fit good. Only problem is color. It is actually a magenta pink not a darker cranberry red like I thought
3.0,Fits a big snug i order a us large fits like a medium still a nice style jacket but they need to get their sizes right
3.0,I like the dress but it is larger than I expected it would be. Wondering if I should try to shrink it.
3.0,Not as ultra thin as expected for a small-framed person.  The thickness of the mechanism is more for a man.
3.0,"Nice pants. The cotton may get softer once you have washed it a couple times. At first it is quite rough. Two reasons I am returning these pants: the color is much more green than what it looked like on the website. Had I known about that I would not have bought them. Two, the fit is VERY tight. I don't see how anyone with a bit of a behind can get themselves into these pants. Yes, they are adjustable, but they start out as medium and you can adjust (tighten) to make them fit a small. Uncomfortable if you are large, impossible if you are x-large."
3.0,"The dress was very pretty but I felt the material was not a good quality, my opinion only. I am short and the print would overwhelm me."
3.0,Hate that the earrings were broken when I received them. Other than that they are nice
3.0,"I have multiples of this shirt in various colors (red, pink, white, yellow, black, and light blue).  The issue is, they all fit me differently.  Some are tight while some are loose.  Yet all are labeled as the same size.  Just be careful and mindful while buying this product.  Some colors are also thinner/cheaper feeling then others."
3.0,"I like the lack of feature marketing and the unique colored bezel. I alao like the countdown timer also shows the current time in the top right corner and (I may be mistaken) that the calendar is set until 2099 (i heard this in a review, not 100% sure on accuracy of the calendar though)<br /><br />I really don't like that the bezel and face are not just metallic but they are mirrors. . . first thing that happened when I put this in was the sunlight flashed directly into my eyes. . . dricing with this on is a love hate thing because at a certain angle it looks like a normal screen but then it'll blind you with reflected light. Affordable yes, but is a mirror that could potentially be unreadable worth it? Hmm, you decide."
3.0,"I gave this to my friend and she found it to be a bit snug, but no real complaints.  It's a fair product and arrived on schedule, which made me real happy."
3.0,"The dress is cute, but came missing a button as pictured. I listened to the reviews and sized up, and it ended up being a little too big. I ordered a Large, for reference I am 5'8 145lbs 36 small B cup, I usually wear a size 6/8 pants and a M/L shirt.<br />The dress is plenty roomy so Im not sure why everyone said to size up? I wouldn't. Unless you have really large breasts then maybe.<br /><br />Update: I decided to give the dress ONE more chance.  I re-ordered in a size M and it fits great.  And bonus.. it has ALL of its buttons. Hahaha. I will keep the large for a spare, because I think it will shrink significantly when washed. Between my two dresses, I have one half way decent dress.<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying it.. keep these things in mind, but it's cheap.. so worth a shot."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:ef3d586ecc0382df65f8c49a32f205ad]] Mask is comfortable, but after a few days, it had an extremely difficult time picking up sound on it's internal microphone. I think the technology is neat, but I feel we still have a ways to go on this working well."
3.0,Like everything except the metal. It had already turned dark.
3.0,Good mittens ..
3.0,"the fit is good and quality is ok, however the leopard on the sleeves was very cheesy looking but it is wearable"
3.0,It's super small
3.0,Felt inexpensive and stripes didn't line up.  Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,I though it was cute but ran a little small. It pulls on my daughter's neck.
3.0,"These are nice, but WAY larger than expected. Very heavy."
3.0,strange shape
3.0,I really wanted to love this dress. The print is super cute but it is really see through
3.0,This watchband disappointed me when it fell apart where it attaches to the watch after 5 months of use. I also found that the paint used on the magnetic ends wore off in that time. I will look for an alternative to replace it.
3.0,very good quality strap but the pins included were too short for the strap.
3.0,"They look great, but they are small on my face."
3.0,Great box for great price
3.0,"I'm a doofus and ordered the wrong size, a medium, which was really short. Exchanged it for my actual size XL. Looks like it's decent quality. XL has yet to arrive, will post update when it does."
3.0,"Cute shoe, but for some reason this was way too big for my 4 year old. He wears an 11 in all other shoes, including other Hawkwell branded shoes."
3.0,"So, let's start with the positives here:<br /><br />+ Style: My twin 11-year-old girls do like it.  They have both worn it multiple times now, which tells me that it passes the fashion test for them.<br /><br />+ Fit: My girls are nearly 12 years old, and they are tall for their age.  So, I got them the Size 13-14, and I am very happy.  It looks good, and they have a little room to grow into it.<br /><br />Now the things that I'm not crazy about:<br /><br />- Not Warm: You cannot get much thinner than this vest.  It must have virtually no filling/insulation in it.  Don't expect this to actually keep your kid warm.<br /><br />- Cheap Zipper: Very disappointed by this rough/sharp garbage zipper.  A decent zipper can make all the difference, but all too often, garment makers go cheap on the zipper.  This zipper is so sharp that you could actually damage the vest and other clothes in the washer with it.  Make sure the vest is zipper UP when you put it into the washer, in order to prevent damaging clothes.<br /><br />- Price: $29.98 for this vest is no bargain, especially given the above drawbacks.  I would feel much better at $19.98.<br /><br />Given the above points, I cannot rate this vest more than 3 stars.  It's fine.  Nothing great."
3.0,"The stone is TINY. I was expecting it to be small, but it doesnt even take up the space of the indentation. The hole is much wider than the stone so it looks like the stone fell out."
3.0,My son wears a size 8 in shirt and pants. So I figured I would order the size 10. The shorts were a bit too short. I  purchase this so he could wear this next summer however he has to wear it for the rest of this season. I'm disappointed in the fit. The style and stitching are really great. It's not cheaply made. My son got to wear this 9ne day when Ronald McDonald showed up one day when we was at McDonald's. It was a bit of a surprise but I now have cute little memories with this outfit on!<br /><br />I purchase this outfit in exchange to test the fit of it amd to review it with my honest opinion!
3.0,I loved this outfit on my daughter but after washing it twice (once before she wore it and once after) the sleeve is already starting to come apart.
3.0,"Light weight. Comfortable. However theres not really a shape to it and the straps dont exactly fall in place like you would think unless maybe your petite. I'm a L/XL maybe ordering a size up would make it fall better, maybe it's the way it's made?"
3.0,"would get much higher stars if it didn't come really wrinkled and was such a pain to press before I wear it. otherwise, great fit, accents all curves in the right way."
3.0,Tried to heat treat 3 stones.  When done I found out there all just died quartz not saphires.
3.0,This would be exactly what is needed except the neckline has a loose seam that has allowed the fabric to unfold and it‚Äôs not able to be worn to dance. Waste of money.
3.0,"Larger and much heavier than anticipated. Unless your lobes are used to the weight, can only be worn for short periods of time.."
3.0,Pretty but watch stops on it's own
3.0,"Had to return them. I ordered size XL, my normal size is 16. I found them to be too tight, they were more like a 14."
3.0,The fit is great! I loved these nose rings... for about a year. They don't last much longer than that before the gemstone starts disintegrating.
3.0,A little tighter than I'd prefer and expected.
3.0,"It's pretty, but runs very small."
3.0,"It‚Äôs a nice shirt but it does not fit true to size. Definitely size up. I got the white and it‚Äôs see through, and not a true white, it‚Äôs more cream colored. The length is good unless I want to tuck it in, which I have to for work. I will be returning and getting a large."
3.0,Arrived with odd smell.  No tags so I don‚Äôt know what material is or how it should be washed.  I‚Äôll wash cold and dry low.  The fit is good.
3.0,It looks just like the picture but it‚Äôs just a tiny bit small.
3.0,"While the watch is very attractive, there is NOT enough color contrast between Hour and minute hand and the watch face.  In various light conditions (outside and inside) it took several seconds (for my eyes) to discern the difference between the Hour and Minute hand and the watch face in order to read the time.  I'm sure Seiko will make the appropriate adjustments so otheres do not have the same issue.  Item return/refund process is not complete.  FedEx website claims the watch has been delivered.  Vender claimed the watch was dirty and coulld not be represented as ""new"" - so I would have to pay a ""Restocking Fee"".<br />While I find the assertion absurd, I do admit to wearing the watch for 2-3 hours over a two day period to ensure I was not being unreasonable about the watch face glare.<br /><br />For me, at 70+ years old, I do not make a habit of making an international purchase ""just to return it for a refund"".  Can the vendor, without fail, guarantee the watch was inspected at their facility before it was shipped and found to be flawless?  But, since I was not in their store, and did not physically inspected the watch before purchase, I have to trust their judgement.  Lesson learned!  Thus far, they have stated that a refund has been processed.  I will update should there be any unreasonable delay."
3.0,"Nice shoes, and I like them very much. However, they fit very tightly making it difficult to close the zipper."
3.0,"Comfy for lounging, but if you wear a large you should go up an extra. Just my experience in the size fitting."
3.0,Not great quality.  A bit thin on the amount of flowers.
3.0,Like the product but gave as gift and they did not care for it
3.0,"Would like these better if the cuff came up beyond the end of my palm. I have to work at the touch screen feature to get it to work but when it works, it works."
3.0,Shorts had a stain
3.0,They're not as shiny as in the picture.
3.0,Super cute but runs big
3.0,"Beautiful top.<br /><br />HOWEVER ... I always take a size small, so ordered a small. Note to future buyers: even if you are teeny, order a size larger. My ""small"" fits too tight for comfort, looks sweet, but I would've ordered a medium had I known. These top sizes must apply to Asian-sized ladies. I'm not returning it - not worth the hassle - but it feels uncomfortable.<br /><br />(5'6"", 34C, 26"" waist, 115 pounds.)"
3.0,"Love them but WAY smaller than expected, but worked for me"
3.0,I did not get the bra that was shown in the photo showing the back.  In the photo the strap adjusters are made so that they can be hooked together so the bra can be worn with racer back shirts.  The bra I received does not have these adjusters.  I'm disappointed but will keep the bra because of the comfortable fit.
3.0,"The pictures are very nice, but the back parts were all over the place. The didn't match where they were attached and I found that to be very strange and frustrating. I never wore them, I gave them away instead. The quality was there, and if they had been attached at the same place, I probably would have worn them a lot."
3.0,rubber that holds glasses arm stretched  after month had to throw away
3.0,"Initially I liked the pattern, but in person it seemed more like wall paper. It was very basic, offered no shape. I actually looked bigger wearing it."
3.0,"They are nice abd cozy, but the fit is odd. The top band is the right size but it can stretch ALOT. When my daughters bends it comes down and you can see her undies. My daughter's botty is a normal size; if your daughter has a big booty keep that in mind. Then the legs get reall skinny at the bottom. It was so skinny we had to cut off the bottom band.  The pant legs fit fine after. At $11 a pair, I guess it's not so bad."
3.0,These gloves do not come in sizes and they were too big to be effective.
3.0,"it was a gift, no negative comments from recipient"
3.0,Much small than I expected. It looked like a thick and heavy leather wrist band... and maybe it would be for a small girl. But it is a bit more dainty than a 6'2 athletic dude would expect.
3.0,The dress was to big
3.0,I give this dress a 3 because I couldn‚Äôt wear it a second time...the material it was made with isn‚Äôt durable...washed it in my machine and it came out bigger than it went in.
3.0,"The magnetic snaps are clever,but still hard to get into the bag easily."
3.0,Pajams are very loose .Not have elastic in it
3.0,"I love Yellow Box flip flops, but these were larger than what I normally get with the same size"
3.0,it is alot more cheap looking than a picture.
3.0,Not true to size in the waist. Material is cheaper than I expected.
3.0,"The quality isnt bad at all! I am a big fan of these, too bad they don't fit my feel very well. I wear size 11.5 shoes and these are pretty damn tight on me. But the material is great and the quality isn't bad at all.<br />I gave them to my girlfriend who has much smaller feet than I and they are great and she loves them."
3.0,I would have liked about 2 more inches in length. The waist wasnt right for me either. They stretched out alot in the waistband.
3.0,The pj's fit rather snugly-my granddaughter didn't like them
3.0,It‚Äôs ok- not stunning but just ok
3.0,I liked the stretch material and the color. Unfortunately I got a whole in the crotch area rather fast. I feel like the threading material just wasn‚Äôt strong.
3.0,I would have given it 5 stars but the fastener fell out after a month of use which made the Fitbit unwearable.  I loved the design and it was very comfortable. They need to improve on a more secure clasp.
3.0,"I am 5'3"" and 150 lbs and ordered a Medium. The top is a bit too small and seems to squish the girls down (DD) and not a lot of support. However, the bottoms fit perfectly! It is awesome that they don't ride way up the side like most of them do these days. I love the bottoms, the top will work but I will more than likely wear a tank over it."
3.0,"It's not the color of the photo, that's why I did not like it very much."
3.0,"I prefer the original inserts, but hard to get even with this vendor. I get a couple different makes every time I order and they're ok, but don't last a long time, Too bad, oh well."
3.0,"The V neck is very low and shows a lot of the ladies, especially if you're big chested. Too much for me"
3.0,"The necklace arrived with the purple heart broken out of the silver lining. Usually, I‚Äôd rate that with a one or two stars. But the pendant was actually much prettier than I expected it to be for the price. A little bit of glue should fix it up as well, but obviously, you‚Äôre going to get what you paid for"
3.0,Really cute and good quality but run extremely small.
3.0,"Runs very big,  and not as cute as pictured"
3.0,It was so cute on here expect that the waist bad was too big. Should be adjustable the top was fine but the pants kept sliding down. My toddle loved to material.
3.0,Fits good..i like it alot
3.0,Material good love color the strings are a pain.
3.0,"I washed it and the wrinkles cannot be ironed out! Weird. It also tore on one side when I sat down, so I shortened it and added the remains as little pockets. Now it makes a good tunic. Try to wash it only by hand and iron it while semi-wet, hope it will work. This garment is made of a very slippery, strange fabric, definitely not silk."
3.0,Love finding bargain jewelry on here
3.0,A bit too boxy to be flattering.
3.0,"Like the design, thought it came with a belt but didnt. Also this would be better in cotton so it maintains the look."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is 4 years old.  She plans on wearing this to my maternity shoot.  I will say I ordered her normal size (5), and it was a bit big on her and the sleeves came to the middle of her forearm.  It's still a great dress though and if anything, she can grow into it a little."
3.0,"They fit well.  Did not like the color, it is a cheap looking red. Not rich like in picture. Returning them."
3.0,"Great design and idea, they need to be larger. They aren't very comfortable for people who fall on the top end of the waist size. I returned these."
3.0,"I got these ears because they were pictured as all grey. When they came in, the tips of the ears were brown. They are still cute but not what I ordered."
3.0,"These are so cute and so soft. But they're very thin. If you're a runner and have a big butt and thick thighs these literally offer no support what so ever. Also, if you're like 99.9% of women and have cellulite, these will definitely show it. Plus, colored panties show through very easily. I use these for everything except working out."
3.0,"The style is really nice.  Could be a great jacket, but it runs really small. I would advise ordering a size larger than normal."
3.0,"Gloves hold shine initially, but lose their shine in the hands area very quiclkly after several uses."
3.0,Color not as nice in person. The color on the screen is a nice crimson red like in the description but when you get it it is a orangy red instead. I was really disappointed. It is not nearly as pretty.
3.0,the bottom part for the 2nd hat came in broken but I keep it anyway. I am using the top part and that is working well.  John R.Egan
3.0,"The dress fits well, and even camouflages my tummy, but the material leaves something to be desired.  It's made with a shiny lycra-like material, which retains heat.  Since I wear it as a summer dress, I don't want or need it to trap heat, but it does.  If the dress could be made with a jersey or knit material, I would buy one in each color and design.  But for a woman undergoing her own personal summers, it's not the best thing to wear in this super hot summer weather."
3.0,I expected a softer fabric but it felt weird. The back is a weird elastic and makes the dress look cheaper. It didn‚Äôt really meet my expectations
3.0,"Cute boots but Very wide in the toe area and the faux leather or whatever it is on the outside is very stiff and not comfortable to walk in. Did not try them outside so I'm not sure how warm they would be, I sent them back."
3.0,"This hat is lovely, however, it was very large for my head.  I lined the inside with cotton and now I can wear it.  Remember,  you get what you pay for.  The hat was 5.00, so I got what I paid for.  The hat was smashed flat when it arrived and it did take some effort to smooth it out again."
3.0,Runs a litter large for my 14lbs.
3.0,Love the ring perfect fit. Would buy again.
3.0,"I needed to replace my referee's watch.  This does the job but it has too many functions for my liking and it's not all that comfortable on my wrist.  Having said that, you can't beat the price."
3.0,"Very basic dress.  Fabric feels kind of sleazy; not much cotton content, very lightweight.  Do order a size or two up--I'm saying this fit as expected because I knew to do that.  It's not a great dress, and the fabric isn't breathable, but if you want something simply to throw on, this might be for you."
3.0,Ok I will give it a 3 star review the reason for it is that the pant are to big and it looks to lose in the front. I am 5.6 and ware clothing size 14-16. I hope this helps some of you guys.
3.0,Super cute but the material is cheap so I don't know how long the sticker will last.
3.0,I typically wear a size Medium and occasionally Large so I ordered Large since I was ordering on line but it is far too tight for me to wear comfortably.  Everything else about it is/looks great other than size. So depending how you wear your clothes you may want to order an upsize just in case.
3.0,"It was ok, but not quite as lightweight as some I have seen. It was a little more bulky. Nevertheless, it's a good product."
3.0,"I really liked the look of this. I wore it for a bit and it was itchy (the hair), so I am sadly returning it."
3.0,"Although my child likes it very much, its smell is so strong that I need to leave it outside for a few days until the smell dissipates."
3.0,I did not realize these are high rise underwear but they do fit right. The fabric is not that good but it's a good deal for how much you get.
3.0,Expected the color to be white. It is more of an ivory or creamy white.
3.0,"So, they are flexible. Like other reviews said, the little retaining ring came off in about a week. It stays in w/out it, but mostly because I'm 7 mon preggers. The round disk is at the entirely wrong angle, no matter which direction you put it in. It sticks out and irritates the skin by the hole. It does not lie flat. The pointed end has a plastic burr on it and tend to snag clothes."
3.0,Fits great but I did order a larger size than needed. Material is different than shown ~ looks Matte in picture but is Shiny Material ~ not a fan of material  but I like the style.
3.0,Too narrow...returned it
3.0,"I was very disappointed that the cut was so small. I chose my regular size but couldn't even zip up the jacket. Other than that, the sweat suit was really cute. Had to be returned unfortunately. I'm hoping my shipping fees will be reimbursed."
3.0,"It‚Äôs thin , it‚Äôs somewhat see through and I very much dislike how scratchy/itchy it feels . It‚Äôs still nice I will be wearing it with a long sleeve because of that feel. True to size ."
3.0,My hubby‚Äôs been cooking a lot and ruining his shirts so he wanted these. The fabric is very light and not to sure it will hold up . Three come in a package . We ordered XL but received L . Will update after a wash and see how it does with stains.
3.0,Pretty narrow coverage in the front.  Wouldnt suggest it for full chested.
3.0,They were very difficult to put on. I returned them.
3.0,This bag would be much better if the zipper was sewn all the way across.  The sides have gaps that could lose stuff.  The pattern is cute and washable.
3.0,"For me, it wasnt ideal for my work bag but could work if I was looking for a purse. I had to return this bag because it was too small and the material was cardboard hard."
3.0,"The quality is fabulous, BUT it's much more green then in the photo. I thought I was getting more of a mint color, but I received more of a grassy/Aqua darker green. And it would be too much to send back, so I'm just going to deal with it."
3.0,Smaller in width than regular military laces but they seem to work.
3.0,"So I get the box, the packaging is great and kept the product protected. I remove the bubble wrap and pick up the jewelry box these braclets come in and the box snaps and breaks off the hinges. I'm disappointed at that because it would have made a nice box. The braclet are nice, they don't feel like 20$ quality though, more like 5$."
3.0,I certainly hope the shipping is free with a $1350 price tag....
3.0,"Seems like a good water shoe, but had to return b/c they were too big."
3.0,"Runs very big. I deliberated between ordering a large or a medium, got medium and it is huge. Color much much brighter then pictured, one shade away from hunters orange."
3.0,Nice but ran a bit large.
3.0,They fit well but the padding isn‚Äôt positioned right. It‚Äôs a bit too thick and too far back even when riding in the drops. The inner edge sits right on the edge of my sit bones causing a pressure point. The padding either needs to be more forward or wider.
3.0,Came with a minor defect. There is a gap between a point of the lens and frame.
3.0,"Ok, so I got a 5x and I was kinda scared to get it because I couldn't be sure the reviews were by real people. I bought the sweater and took a chance. So, it's more true to size than a lot of other sweaters you see made by random amazon companies with fake looking reviews. They're usually made by places in Asia and run smaller - you know what I'm talking about. Not this sweater. It's also pretty cozy. I like that the neck is high but some might not. If you wear a shirt underneath its nice (you can get hot in it easily though if you're inside). I've seen some people wear sweaters as shirts but I wouldn't recommend it for this one. It's cozy like I said earlier, but it isn't thick at all. It feels like it was handmade with yarn and its rather thin. Seems cheaply made and it looks more like the Wish version than what is shown in the pictures. I personally like it though."
3.0,Nice gloves but too big for my small hands
3.0,I like these earrings but was disappointed in the size and the online description is not completely correct... also the quality is not as I expected it should be.  The hearts bend very easy so not easy to put on and not durable.
3.0,"Very Pretty earrings, but smaller and daintier than I was expecting."
3.0,"I was conflicted about the number of stars to give this.  I give the concept and design 5 stars.  I am a die-hard Seahawks fan and I love to be able to show my spirit.  The Bradford Exchange allowed me to return the Seahawks bracelet and exchange it for the Seahawks Superbowl bracelet because I ordered it before the Superbowl - then they won and I definitely wanted the Lombardi trophy charm; however, it took at least four phone calls and I can't tell you how many emails to accomplish this. The charms are nice.  The football helmet is quite detailed.  The charms include the helmet, football, jersey, green and blue beads, hearts with the Seahawks name and crystal, Seahawks name charm and the Lombardy trophy.  I would give 1 star to the customer service department - intentions are good but the follow through is terrible.  The biggest disappointment is the quality of the materials used to make the bracelet - it turns my arm green and dark blue.  $120 for a bracelet that turns my arm green/dark blue? For the price of this bracelet, they should have used sterling silver or another metal that isn't so cheap instead of the cheapest silver plating around.  I guess I should be happy that at least when my skin turns color from the bracelet - it turns into Seahawks colors!"
3.0,Top too skimpy but bottoms fit great.  36E size 10 jean.  Ordered XL.  Cups were way too small unfortunately. Would have liked if mix & match sizes were possible.
3.0,"These are okay.  They are a little tight at the ankles and probably too baggy in the middle.  I understand that this is what is supposed to be the style, but I think they could have been better in execution"
3.0,Really soft but runs large
3.0,"These gloves are ok.  There was some loose yarn and I had to remove the glove to use my phone a few times.  otherwise, the price was great, I received them quickly, and they kept my hands warm."
3.0,"These are decent, but the fit is totally off. I would typically take a size 1X, and these 3X just fit. However, they feel good and are nicely constructed of quality material, and the waistband is comfortable.  Being opaque, they‚Äôre thicker than your average pair of pantyhose, and they don‚Äôt look like they will run.<br /><br />But, I seriously would love to know what size that model in the photo is wearing and how she got the tights up over her elbows???  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, and I have slimmer legs, and they just barely stretch up to my waist. Maybe she‚Äôs 4‚Äô5‚Äù?????<br /><br />I would recommend going up 2 sizes with these."
3.0,Pretty but cheaply made. Broke first time I put on
3.0,very thin and narrow
3.0,Tela no tan fresca
3.0,Great design but runs small.
3.0,"I like the material but, like the others that commented, it does not fit well to pull down on the shoulders. Too tight across the shoulders although the rest of it did fit just fine."
3.0,"Bought, tried, returned. Too long. Yarn tassel feels cheap. If they were an inch shorter, had a quality tassel, and only one tassel, then they'd be okay. As it is, I now have to look elsewhere. I wanted a fun, green tassel earring for summer, but these are a definite no. I need some quality in my jewelry, even it's only costume."
3.0,"Fabric feels cheap, thin. Very ‚Äúboxy‚Äù fit."
3.0,Order 1 size down
3.0,Was looking for something that had no built in bra.
3.0,"Bracelet looks great, classy and fashionable for weddings and formal occasions. I have received plenty of comments from other people about how they like it. A heavier bracelet, which is what I wanted when I ordered. Only downfall is I have worn it three times and already it is starting to scratch and chip away. I would recommend to anyone who will wear it without sitting at a table and having your wrist hit the table or slide across it at all."
3.0,Love the shorts!! I got size large and the top fits more like a small/medium.
3.0,They a  little bit tough to set it up I decided it was really not going to help me that much but it‚Äôs still worth a try to somebody I really need to be sure mine are tight and stay tight but . magnet is really strong amazing
3.0,it was for someone but we no longer together so i don't what he did with but thank you anyways
3.0,"material is not bad compare to price, but i did not like it"
3.0,"these lenses are smeary, even when totally cleaned with glasses cleaner"
3.0,Thinner than I thought. Looks a bit lopsided as well. It'll work though. Color is exact.
3.0,"These are not very convenient sunglasses.  The lenses flip up and down, but it's really hard to flip up or flip down.  They fit fairly good over glasses, but just not comfortable."
3.0,All is good but one shoe will not charge and light up.
3.0,I guess you get what you payed for and in this case it was. Low quality in the design but overall still a cute shirt.
3.0,"This necklace is very pretty, but it is heavy.  I don't usually wear bubble necklaces so the weight might be normal."
3.0,way to short at the hem. did not like.
3.0,These are ok for the price. They‚Äôre good especially for someone who likes these overpriced stuffed animals. They‚Äôre ok for the price
3.0,Estaban secos y un poco duros
3.0,"The straps work ok, but didn't provide enough if a backless look I was going for."
3.0,"These are beautiful. When I opened the package, one of the earrings wasn‚Äôt assembled or had come apart during shipping so I did have to superglue the front piece with flowers back onto the tunnel. Quick fix though and I will be wearing at my wedding."
3.0,"Tabs on chest pockets hang at an odd angle. Nice quality, thick leather."
3.0,Tubes come undone after a few weeks.<br />But can be fixed!<br />Threds come undone.<br />But can be stitched!
3.0,Although very cool and the digital printing is well done. The biggest problem is the sizing.<br />I normally wear an  EX-Large. I ordered the 3X because of some of the reviews about the fit.<br />Well this is like wearing a SMALL! way too tight. I will see if my son can ware it.<br />It is also NOT a zippered top. It is a pullover. Although thin I didn't mind the fabric.<br />If it fit then I would have loved it.
3.0,Le sal-pique agua y ya no sirve.
3.0,It looked beautiful and seemed like good quality but I had to return it because it was too small
3.0,adjustment of cap size slips
3.0,The shirt fit but was short.
3.0,Es muy sencilla el material no es lo esperado
3.0,It is not an XXL.  Having to return it as much smaller than ‚ÄúXXL/XXXL‚Äù
3.0,I love the dress but it was too thin and arrived with a small hole in the shoulder area.. I just kept it to wear around the house.
3.0,Feels and looks cheap.
3.0,I love how this shoe looks and it also has a fruity smell which is nice. Unfortunately it was difficult to put on my toddlers feet.  It also came off easily which is also frustrating.  It‚Äôs too bad because it goes with everything and looks cute!
3.0,"Love the fabric of the pants, however they are not the pants that are pictured.  They do not have a wide opening at the bottom of the leg, rather they are tight with slits on the side.  Also, one pant leg is longer than the other.  They also fit smaller than expected.  Disappointed."
3.0,Kind of small but very cute. Maybe better for a little girl since the pendant is so tiny. But my friend loved it
3.0,Maybe it‚Äôs my hate for velvet but it feels like a costume. Didn‚Äôt suit my shape.<br />Not form fitted
3.0,"Bought these for my wife.  They're good, but I'm deducting a star since the white ones weren't in the package when they were in the selection I ordered.  Lame."
3.0,Good bag but wish it was a little bigger pockets are too small.hard to get shoes in.
3.0,Sizing was fine. Fabric was not as comfortable as I would like. Felt stiff and not nice. They‚Äôre okay but not something I would buy again.
3.0,I love the price but not the quality of product
3.0,"It‚Äôs a cute coat, but not for heavy winter as it‚Äôs not as puffy as it is advertised. The fur is also not as nice as the picture."
3.0,I ordered the jumpsuit in medium and in black because I was getting it for a semi formal party I was going to attending.  It looks really cute but a little tighter than I was expecting it to be.  Very soft material though it is not what I thought it was going to be it feels more more spandex and then a polyester blend.  It also holds up well in the washing machine.  Now it is not very flattering on me so I did not take any pictures of myself in it.<br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in return for an honest and unbiased review.
3.0,"The design is amazing. I really loved the way it looked and how it wore. I just did not like that within a week, it turned my neck green."
3.0,"It's a very cute print; but exactly that. The material is thin and kind of a cheap look to it. It's fine and comfortable for casual wear, but would not be my choice for anything nicer than that. It does fit well and the print helps provide an hourglass look for those of us who do not have much curve."
3.0,It does not fold completely. Seems to be too small for the checks.  Looks nice but function is so so. Don't know about durability yet.
3.0,A little lightweight
3.0,"I like look and feel of the watch. However, the luminous features of the watch suck. Waking up after 4-5 hours; it‚Äôs impossible to tell the time, the hands and dots are so very very faint."
3.0,The dress was a little to body conscious for my liking. And the material was not what I expected--although I can't describe it. I think I needed to be about 20 years younger to wear this dress!
3.0,it's very wide
3.0,Wish I'd ordered a larger size . I would have returned it but my grandson needed a sweater right away!
3.0,It‚Äôs a men‚Äôs string not a baby onesie. I thought it was onesie because of photos.
3.0,"I really like the skirt itself, it‚Äôs thick and well made and the colors are nice.  The zipper is a little challenging to use, it seems a bit cheaply made and I won‚Äôt be surprised if it breaks eventually.  My biggest issue is with the sizing of the inner lining though.  I'm in the US and usually wear a size 12 or 14, or US large, so I ordered an xl (tag 4xl) and the outer skirt fits fine but the inner lining is MUCH smaller than the skirt, which makes no sense. It‚Äôs like they just use the same size lining regardless of the size of the skirt.  I cut a slit in the lining from bottom to top so I can get the skirt on, and now it fits ok.  We‚Äôll see how it wears with the lining slit; if it bunches up I may just take it out entirely."
3.0,"Love the style and the color, the only thing is so buggy and wide for my daughter foot. That's why I give 3 stars"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d431064a47a456bab863bf20d910ca5]] okay the fabric looks good quality, it smells like rubber, i bought it in size L but it looks like XL"
3.0,quality of the hat is pretty cheap. i would pay 10 bucks more to have a nice &#34;new era&#34; style hat
3.0,Really nice & would buy again just buy a bigger size. Made nice & material is soft & comfortable... It arrived on time also... If you a small you need to buy a large...
3.0,They seem very cheaply made and are difficult to see through.
3.0,It's a 2 piece. After trying it on it look like the dress had a lot going on. It was also way too short for me. I returned.
3.0,I loved this item I love the color but it was the wrong size this is not in Miss
3.0,"Its definitely lightweight, a bit wider than I expected.  I ordered the beige pair, they have a black squishy sole and a lime green insert.  They are not ""slipper soft"" but more like those ""water shoes"" kind of soft.  Its like trying to put on a pair of no-show socks that have a cheap flipflop sole.  You cant just slip them on and off feet without using your hands or the other foot.  They are perfect for walking on my hardwood floors all day, but I forget to pyt them back on because I cant just step in or out of them.  I am not one to wear shoes without socks but these make bottom of my bare feet hot and almost wearing a blister on bottoms of feet because of insert not being all that ""wicking"" or breathable.  Lastly, the insert tries to come out with my foot whenever I try taking them off.  Note that virtually all shoes I own can be put on by stepping in/out of them either by design or because I adjusted them to do that, such as my laceup sneakers and I wear socks most of the time, rarely wear sandals.  I havent decided if I like these ""slippers"" or not.  The soles are also perfect for walking on driveway, brick steps, and sidewalks in yard."
3.0,"These were a perfect fit for me and the price is great! Except --I disliked they way the back of the jeans were finished.  On the pair I received there was an abrupt start to the fading technique beginning at and including the lower part of the back pocket.  It reminded me of a single paint stroke. So disappointing! The front of the jeans were nicely finished.  I kept these with tags on for several days, tried them on a few times but jut couldn't get past the too-fake looking (imo) finish."
3.0,"These fit me OK, but they are too small for my husband.  They don‚Äôt cover enough of his face and the straps are too tight around his ears.  They‚Äôre also way too big for our children."
3.0,image did not look right and material felt cheaply made.
3.0,Great quality but there is only 1 band in this order. Picture and description are misleading.
3.0,The chain and pearls are very high quality but the diamonds are cloudy and seem very low quality
3.0,I received my package today.  It looks okay if you wear it exactly like the model in the picture with your hands in the pocket!!!...However it mainly looks like wearing a bag.  Also way too long.  Comes to the knees. The price too high for what you get. I won't by yet again.
3.0,see through and runs big for size small
3.0,"They pants are quite thin. You may need another layer, which I wanted to avoid."
3.0,"Nice looking in the picture but it does not look too good,"
3.0,"Smells kind of musty.  I'm hoping a little Febreze will get rid of the funk, because it doesn't look like something that I can just throw in the wash.  Also it doesn't quite look like the picture.  I was hoping for more of that bright royal blue but when it is all unfolded, it almost looks more green."
3.0,"looks good, priced well, the only bad is I had it for less than a year and the safety loop that keeps the strap close tore."
3.0,"Loving the material and the color, but the top part was small and not a push up bra."
3.0,The design is pretty unique. It's easy to install. The size and weight are good. Unknown material make up. Will change colors.
3.0,It was too tight for my shoulders I normally wear a small and Northface and the jacket was just a little tight for me
3.0,Doesn't look quite as cool in the picture. It is very tableclothish. But it was inexpensive.
3.0,Runs large and no better fabric quality than target leggings but with knee patches.  Not worth the cost in my opinion. They don‚Äôt hold anything in place. I would expect there to be some compression but to achieve that your pants will likely be see through as they‚Äôre so thin.
3.0,"It works ‚Äúok‚Äù.  Clasp is light weight, does not stay in place.  Still gets tangled, not as bad as without.  It‚Äôs fine for a cheap fix.  Btw, each necklace has to put on as a regular necklace.  One it‚Äôs on, it‚Äôs on... not easy to change."
3.0,"Great value, tho I had to return them because they were all to large for my face. When I returned them I asked for smaller lensed ones instead of a refund & didn't get any response just my money back. I was bummed. I really wanted smaller lenses as the ad shows more smaller lenses."
3.0,They are okay but seemed to get stretched easy.
3.0,Brought dress for outing. Material is thin and  will rip easily.
3.0,"Looks super cute on Amazon and similar in person but not quite the same, although would be hard pressed to tell you why. The chest area is very odd with the way the patterned fabric is cut and how restrictive it feels for the size of the shirt but the bottom does flow nicely and is flattering. Had I not bought this as a lightening deal for under $10, it would be returned."
3.0,"On the bright side they came early which was a plus, but after only wearing them once, the metal piece that's supposed to go through your ear to hold the fox's head there, fell out, granted I know how to fix it, but it's still frustrating that they broke the day I got them."
3.0,"absolutely no tags anywhere on the dress or on the bag it was sealed in. No washing/care instructions whatsoever. It appears smaller than the size I ordered. Looks like the image, so that is a plus. Not really happy with this purchase."
3.0,"For the price these are great & the do work well with keeping sweat out of the eyes. However, once you wash them the seem starts to unravel, so be careful not to pull the strings!"
3.0,"I liked the design, but hated the cheapness of the watch. It sounds like 2 pieces of tin clacking together because of the length. Kept twisting around."
3.0,"I was offered this bra to test and review. The following is my unbiased review based on product testing.<br /><br />The bra fits like a minimizer. My breasts were not cradled by the cups as I had hoped they would be. Instead, the cups are slightly smaller than they should be for a C cup. I am doubtful that a size up would have helped. The way the bra cups are shaped, this bra feels overall uncomfortable. My breasts felt compressed, and it wasn't because the fit was small, it was because of the shaping.<br /><br />Overall comfort of the bra was okay, but not fantastic. The left strap seemed to be sewn slightly off kilter. Adjusting did not help, it was positioned on my shoulder slightly too far off my arm, over my shoulder joint. It made for a very odd feel.<br /><br />I was going to wear the bra today to test how it held up and felt after a day's use, but I decided against it after trying it on and disliking the way it felt. It was not a flattering bra in feel or in comfort. I am guessing that I received one that flunked quality control as the other reviews appear to be positive."
3.0,"The wallet itself functions very well. The interior is roomy and the construction is good. However, the external graphic is not printed on. The best way I can describe it is that it's like a vinyl cling. The graphic shifted after only a day of carrying this in my back pocket."
3.0,nice heavy piece but the diamond is smaller than it appears in photos.
3.0,"Fits as expected but, wasn't the right fabric i was wanting i couldn't find a rothco longsleeve so i got this but it was the elastic material not the cotton material like a normal shirt."
3.0,"10/2/2019-UPDATE:  Downgraded to 3-STARS. The leather on these shoes have worn away at the toes (as with other shoes that I've purchased) and so I now have to buy new shoes for my 3yo daughter.  In an effort to get some length of time between having to buy new shoes, I usually rotate her shoe wearing between 2-pairs of uniform shoes.  I have her wear one Mon thru Tues/Weds then switch to the other pair for Wed/Thurs thru Friday. I've been having the same toe wear and/or Velcro closure weakening with all of these uniform shoes. (The Velcro is fine on this one at this time).  I think toddlers are just hard on their shoes due to all the jumping and running around that she does at school/day care, so I won't hold this quality issue against the shoe manufacturer because it's an issue I've experienced with ALL of them that I've purchased.  6/2019-5 STARS- These shoes delivered on time as promised. They seem pretty sturdy and I hope they last long. The quality seems better than other uniform shoes I‚Äôve purchased on Amazon.  Only time will tell."
3.0,Lock beter in the picture
3.0,"IT is a gorgeous piece, for the first couple months it had a high odor which was hard to get eliminate"
3.0,"Really nice boots, but WAYYYY too small. I wear an 11w, so I ordered a 12 just to be safe. They didn't fit at all. They fit like a size 10. I didn't return them though, my mom (who wears a size 10) wants them."
3.0,These pants are very warm and cozy.  They wash well and my five year old son loves how easy they are to pull on and off.  He had a school uniform and they work for his uniform requirements.  They do run large in the seat of the pants.  Almost looks like he had a diaper on.  I sized down.
3.0,If I had tried this on in the store I wouldn't have kept it.  There is nothing really special about it.  The black pattern is stamped on and the material wrinkles easily.  I like the color but overall disappointed.
3.0,"okay but not the best line of bras I've used...I wouldn't purchase others from this company, but this one was ok."
3.0,"The dragonfly is much smaller than it appears in the picture, not bad considering the price."
3.0,The shirt is nice quality but the sizing runs very small.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt get the free cover for the Apple Watch but the band was great
3.0,"Good size bag.  From the beginning the zippers either buckle or open in the middle, while closed.  Also, I have had to put the zipper pull back on the main compartment, twice."
3.0,The elastic in the pants is too tight. If you're thick it's going to give you muffin top. It's made out pajama material and so it looks more like lounge or sleep wear. I wouldn't wear this outside of the house. There's no support in the top.
3.0,"The frames are durable, but the mirror finish on the lens are not.  After a few uses,  it's already rubbing off."
3.0,"The shirt looks like the picture but the fabric is awful. Like a hospital gown, but not the soft cotton ones. Like plasticy."
3.0,"Cute , but small, make sure the plastic part is on back or they will fall of over and over."
3.0,"This suit ran small. I normally wear a large in swimsuits, but the bottoms dug in when I tried them on. The top didn't offer any support. I didn't end up wearing the suit in water, because it was too constricting to wear out of the bedroom. The color green also wasn't a turquoise like in the photo. It was more of a Christmasy emerald green. The fabric did seem like it was nice and sturdy and would last. Buy a size up if you're considering it.¬†¬†"
3.0,"it's not what the picture show's, but it on a little small for my wrist."
3.0,This shirt fits oddly. It is too wide and too short all at once. I had my son wear it probably twice before it just got ridiculous due to fitting so awkward. Cute shirt if it actually fit properly.
3.0,They fall out of the ear very easily. They are very nice looking but you can fit two of them in the length of one you but from a store. If not for that they would be amazing. Oh and the sparkly ones were broken on arrival.
3.0,"For clothing, the important points of evaluation are accuracy in sizing, quality of materials, the feel of the fabric on your skin, wash-ability, closet-space and fold-ability. As such, for dresses, these are the points I evaluate. I can't evaluate style, as we all have different tastes, but the objective points can be easily reported in review, to aid you in your search for that special something that will work for you and make you feel beautiful.<br /><br />Accuracy In Sizing:  This dress is sized accurately, meeting the standards set by the measurements in the listing. It fits her exactly as expected.<br /><br />Quality Of Materials:  The fabric is not too thin, almost medium-weight, and has a nice drape. The stitching is average, nothing amazing, but, more importantly, it has been stitched incorrectly. The skirt has a vertical seam on the back and then another vertical seam on the front. This is virtually unheard of and makes the dress look cheap, like it was made from fabric remnants. That is most unfortunate and makes this  a dress you would be better off wearing around the house or out to buy groceries.<br /><br />Feel Of Fabric:  The fabric is soft, bordering on ultra-soft. It wears well and is comfortable.<br /><br />Wash-ability:  The fabric is washable and can be washed easily. It should be washed inside-out, as should all garments.<br /><br />Closet-Space:  This one takes up very little hanging space, as it compresses easily, and can be stored on a top bar, with a little overhang at the bottom.<br /><br />Folding:  This dress can be folded, like a t-shirt. It will not develop permanent creases or creases that will be difficult to get out.<br /><br />Good luck finding the dress that will make you look and feel amazing."
3.0,"This shirt was too large for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and<br /><br />1) The sleeves were way past my elbows<br /><br />2) The stitching was visible<br /><br />3) The v-vent much too low<br /><br />Overall, not worth the money, but the color is nice."
3.0,Light material they do breathe and not get hot. But not a lot of room at all. Very tight xxl feels very tight
3.0,"Easy to install and look better with the colored covers than only the watch band. Unfortunately they did not send a black cover as shown in their picture, but sent a duplicate of another color so it does not match the band."
3.0,"the boots dont look the same the size 7 looks better then the 7.5 the 7,5 looks shorter and the color dont look the same the size 7 is taller then the 7.5 i dont like the 7.5 i liked the size 7 but it were to tight ok i will return these boots their to long a 7.5 is to long for my feet that size 7 were nices but it were to tight i couldnt get my foot in them pass the rope nice boots but i liked the size 7 they were nicer these i will return this 7.5 they to long on my feet and their diffrent dont look like the size 7 i order mabe  i will order  another pair in the furture but not right now very disapointed  but this were my first pair trying these boots  and i liked them their nicer boots for every women to have in their closer but the strip is to tight on them thats why i had to try a 7.5 the 7 were ok if the strip were not to tight around the size 7"
3.0,Good martial. Loose fitting in the waist but perfect in the hips. No stretch. Nice quality but will need a lot of tailoring. I have a nice butt and you'd never know it because these pants Give extreme mom-butt.
3.0,"The viewing quality is great; however, I found the metal edge to be quite sharp which is a safety issue."
3.0,"I took the advise of reviews and ordered up...big mistake. I'm a 40DDD, 16-top, 14-bottom and ordered a XXL. Wish I hadn't...way too big in the boob area. Will try to shrink it by washing, hopefully it works."
3.0,Basically an iron on shirt but my daughter loved it so that is all that mattered.
3.0,The style is cute but it has a lot of the back out and was somewhat small. Thinking about returning it back never wore.
3.0,I liked the styles and colors. Not as thick or warm as I expected.
3.0,"The earnings were pretty and appeared well made, but the pink color is so light in color that it really looked white.  You had to really study it under a bright light to be able to see any hue of pink. The color is nothing like it is  pictured here...much...much...lighter in color.<br /><br />If you truly want pink....I suggest you look elsewhere.  I am."
3.0,"I LOVED this ring but right after I started wearing it, it turned yellow gold<br /><br />UPDATE* after 6 months of continuous wear it is silver looking so not good. PHOTO is next to my yellow gold band"
3.0,"Very thing material. Within a month of wear, I am down a pair because one develop a hole. Not as breathable as I would hope, especially due to the thinness of the material."
3.0,Doesn't hold and is too heavy on the ear. Got it earlier than intended which is great
3.0,It's very pretty but the liner inside popped off after a week or so.  I glued it back on so we'll see how long it lasts.  It came with extra rhinestones which is a nice touch.
3.0,Feels nice but one strap bursted the next morning.
3.0,"Fingers are too long, but they are very nice gloves."
3.0,"Has no stretch, but I love it."
3.0,Very cute dress!  One pocket is almost sewed shut though!
3.0,"top was super small.  bought a XXL for me, my daughter is wearing it and she usually wears juniors small or medium.  it's a touch big on her but not American sizing XXL."
3.0,"It‚Äôs elastic, but very stiff in that you really have to stretch it to wear it. My other one was much better. Would look elsewhere."
3.0,Interesting detail but size is very stretchy.
3.0,"These are very pretty and sparkly. You don‚Äôt even feel them on. The reason for only three stars is that they are stretchy, like an elasticized bracelet, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting that, so they don‚Äôt have the swing movement that regular hoops do. Also, the butterfly clasp is attached to the end of the hoop."
3.0,And don't get me wrong this is a gorgeous necklace. Good artisan and craftsmanship went into this. I love the elephant and I look specially with chunk of quartz on it rose quartz it looks like. The gold chain is nice my spouse thinks it's real gold looks like. Elephant could have been 3D instead of flats only turns around there's something on on all sides. The elephant is beautiful nonetheless as is the wonderful chunk of Crystal that was included. Made by Indian artisans is gorgeous sadly the chain is too small and I wasn't able to get it on it made it too tight almost like a choker as opposed to a necklace. However get a crafty witch I'm using it as a pendulum instead which could be use this one if you know what pendulums are. Too beautiful not to. Keep it anyway cuz I'm almost going to give it to my mom but I can't bring myself to do it because it is too pretty. I happen to love elephants and stuff made from India and that comes from India. I really appreciate it I'm glad I found it on Vine I just wish the chain would have been longer and I would feel too guilty modding it even though I know how to fix jewelry I make my own jewelry I would not want to mod it in anyway cuz it's too beautiful  I'm going to keep it as it isn't as a keepsake and something from look at cuz it's that gorgeous
3.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to a memorial service this weekend and wanted to love it, but sadly I'll be sending it back.  I'm about a size 8 and ordered a medium after reading all the reviews.  It was too small on top and I couldn't button it up even though it's stretchy, so I'd have to wear a camisole or something underneath.  I'm average chested, about a 34C, so I don't see how bigger busted gals fit in this.  Then the bottom was too big and just looked sloppy.  It looked ok from the front, but made me look frumpy from the side and like I was trying to hide being pregnant.  Ordering up a size would only make that worse.  The belt hung down instead of right under the top and I was dissapointed the &#34;buckle&#34; was gold tone and not silver.  The lace pattern is very pretty and looks nice from the back and I like the retro design.  The dress has some weight to it and it seems that the top should have more structure than just lace and a built-in cami for such a heavy skirt.  Don't plan to wear this in any type of warm weather!"
3.0,warning!!! I normally wear an xl size glove and that is what I received according to the package but they are too tight! looks like a size large at best.  I waited until it was cold enough to wear them and now these are useless to me!
3.0,"I know I'm late to the show, but this was my first pair of REAL leggings. I have lots of yoga pants and the cropped legging type but no real leggings. So I read reviews for literally like 2 months off and on. I wanted fleece lined. I do like these but they have a sheen to them, a little shiny or like slick when you feel them, kinda like if you are wearing pantyhose. Btw that's also how you put them on. I run pretty true to size. I am 5'11 and they are long enough for me. I just thought that they run a little small.<br /><br />I took a chance and bought another pair from diff company and they are like butter.  I live in then every day and bought a 2nd pair. These 2nd ones are not fleece lined but I could care less. They aren't as warm but 10x more comfy. They are Lush Moda Extra Soft leggings sold by Moda Boutique. Please look them up and give them a try. I would give them 10 stars if I could.<br /><br />The leggings the review is about are ok, but not what I wanted in a legging. I'd rather them be soft than slick and no fleece and feel so buttery on my skin."
3.0,"It had potential but the item I received seemed unfinished. The ends were lose and not stitched, definitely just cut with scissors.<br /><br />Maybe from far away it might have worked but it looked off."
3.0,Rather opaque
3.0,"I love the ring, it is comfortable and fit is perfect. That being said, the etching leaves something to be desired. It is very, very thin and not easily seen. If shipping wasn't so high I would purchase the black one too."
3.0,The hair comes off a lot. In big clumps
3.0,Tiene buena calidas solo un poco peque√±o pero me gusta
3.0,I don't believe it was worth the price.
3.0,"They were nice for what I needed but if the description says opaque, that‚Äôs what I expect and these were only slightly more opaque than regular tights"
3.0,"I liked how they look in the picture, but they are way too big (round/thick) for my need."
3.0,I was nervous when I first opened this dress after reading some views on how delicate the he pwarls were on the sleeves. I was pleasantly surprised to find the material is nice and thick but the pearls on the collar were not placed evenly. I did purchase another dress in the meantime so I will update you to see if the collar is any better on the second dress. Fingers crossed as I was planning on wearing this dress to take family picture next weekend.
3.0,The zippers suck. I have to open and close them several times before getting it to latch an zip up. The zippers to open on their own. This is really bad when you have it in backpack mode because stuff will just fall out.
3.0,"I have been looking for a watch band that does not cause my skin to become raw. I saw a metal band and figured I would give it a try. It is comfortable and it doesn‚Äôt cause a reaction on my skin. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve had other issues with this band.  The glue holding the magnet in on the closer has failed and the magnet keeps coming out. I can put new glue on it but it is a shame it only lasted 2 months. Also the sides on the band get snagged on materials. I ripped part of the hem of my pants with a sharp part of the band.<br />I really want to love this watch band because it‚Äôs really pretty and overall comfortable. There are a few flaws that are preventing me from suggesting it to others though. The manufacturer could easily fix the magnet issue which would make it a more secure fit."
3.0,I'm never sure on size so I always go up and this is a bit larger than expected. Love it though.
3.0,Material is rough and it shrinks when washed.
3.0,Seems to help the glare a pit but I wish it didn't darken the entire area quite as much.
3.0,order sweater in right size just didn't like the way it fit me!
3.0,"Shiny, satin type of material."
3.0,Cute shoes but I had a horrible smell
3.0,One out of four pairs of these came out of the package completely broken and unusable! A second pair once put on broke after five minutes. I‚Äôm scared to try the last two pair for fear that they will break as well. I originally rated this product with a single star. However the company contacted me and made every effort to correct the situation. They immediately sent out an entire new order in which nothing was broken. Much happier the 2nd time around and very pleased that they took the time to fix things.
3.0,Maybe I had an oddly shaped head but this will NOT stay down on my head and always slips upwards.
3.0,VERY see through... Too tight on my chest. Ordered XL and it fit like a tight Large
3.0,Very excellent and provide the demand for appointment
3.0,"Even using the sizing chart, this ended up being too small on my 6 year old (tall but slender) daughter. Rather than return, we modified the shoulder straps, because it is very pretty."
3.0,"Straps don‚Äôt even fit around my ankles, it‚Äôs loose and can‚Äôt even strap them properly because there‚Äôs not enough holes. Definitely will be returning."
3.0,"They don't fit the size they say very well, they are small!"
3.0,"I took a gamble on this which I rarely ever do with something that doesn't have a lot of reviews.  As one reviewer already said, it is not form fitting.  its not flattering on me either.  I'm 5'5&#34; 115 lbs and the small is a bit big.  It is comfortable, warm and soft.  That's why it gets 3 stars.  I'll likely wear it around the house only."
3.0,"Ordered an extra large and couldn't get my other arm into it.  Extremely lightweight and porous, meaning it gets you wet if it gets wet. I suspect it could be useful for some kind of brisk autumn walk but be aware of the sizing issue.  It's made of 100 % polyester and has super deep pockets.  It's too light to be a windbreaker but might make it as a running jacket because it's so light. Can't really address it because I couldn't use it.  I do give it some props for being able to be stuffed into the size of a baseball. so if you get one that fits it could be a great emergency jacket in the glove compartment."
3.0,"This is a cute dress but so short, had to send back."
3.0,This shirt is pretty and very silky soft but super see through. Gorgeous print with very soft texture just thin material. I need to wear a white camisole under it.
3.0,"I bought a large and this sweater fits me more like a size medium. I haven't washed it yet but I'm sure it is bound to shrink. It does look like the picture but it is a tad small and thin. I hate to use the word cheap, so I won't but if you buy get a size bigger."
3.0,Just a bare minimum generic glove not really made for cycling. Looks nice.
3.0,Great price. Fits fine. The pink is see through so will have to be worn under a skirt or shorts.
3.0,"Very pretty. Has nice quality. However, chain pulled and gets hair stuck in it and knotted unlike any other chain. None of my other chains do that. Besides that, I'm happy."
3.0,nice but not packaged well - hard to give as a gift in the cheap paper package.
3.0,Material very lightweight
3.0,"Top is okay.  Not what I had expected as far as quality.  Overall, this is cheaply made.  I gave this a 3 star because it was received on time."
3.0,This product was smaller than I thought it would be.
3.0,"Very tight! I sized up too. It stretches but, the material clings to everything. I wish it was mixed with cotton. Super fitted. I like the style though so, I'm keeping it & will wait until I lose these quarantine lbs!"
3.0,"This is a beautiful, light and flowing, scarf.  The only bad comment I have is that it smelled very strongly of fish, I had to put it into the washer as soon as I got it.  I hung it outside to dry and the smell is gone.  It washed very nicely as well.  Pretty scarf for a cheap price."
3.0,"It is adorable, but it is teeny tiny.  I ordered a medium for my daughter but it was so small i had to give it to my friend who is 5 feet 1 inch and 100 pounds who wears a size zero. It just fit her.  Definitely measure and for reference I say it runs 2 sizes smaller than US sizes."
3.0,Love them but need a larger size
3.0,It's a strange color gold.  Not gold and not rose gold???  You can't really wear them with gold jewelry.
3.0,"Cute dress with a couple of things to be aware of: I'm 5 foot four and 145 pounds ‚Äì I bought a size 8 and it fits perfectly. This is the size I typically wear in clothing. However, it sits or ends about an inch below my knee. I wish it were a little bit shorter. Especially for the kind of dress it is. The other thing I wasn't too happy about is that the hem is wired. It was very odd. Also, the see-through overlay hangs about 2 inches below the lining. If I had kept it would've taken out the wired hemming and just cut off about 2 inches and put my own him in. That would've solved everything."
3.0,I was gifted this and it came with a broken chain. I need to be contacted. It is very beautiful though. I just want a new chain.
3.0,Shirt fits fine but the material is rough.  For some reason the with shirts are softer but the dyed shirts are rough.<br />This is what we live with now.
3.0,"The fit was okay, but it is more like a silky robe, than a dress.  The flap over the buttons is weirdly sewn and it gaps."
3.0,Nice and easy to use.
3.0,Runs very small. Elastic twists instantly and does not stay up at all. Very low rise.
3.0,"This dress is just okay. I bought it for St. Patricks day with the intent of wearing it out again for non St Patricks day activities. But I just wasn't crazy about it.<br /><br />The nice part is, the fabric on the top portion is very breathable and comfortable for a hot day."
3.0,Looks ok but I did not use it a lot
3.0,"Nice quality, cool looking Hoodie, but definitely runs small for an XL order at least a size up, maybe 2 depending on how you like things to fit... Will most certainly have to hang dry this one."
3.0,"Needed some trim work on the metal and a link came apart, but was easily repaired."
3.0,They are pretty but smaller than I expected will not wear them but will give them to my neice
3.0,was a family birthday gift
3.0,Nice color but it runs small.
3.0,The hat is so-so. I wish it was a SnapBack hat but I will use it when cleaning the truck or gardening.
3.0,"I got a lot of compliments on it, and it is super cute. But it had a small string pulling loose from the front of the dress when it had arrived, which only got worse after I put in on, and the straps wouldn't stay on my shoulders."
3.0,I never had the opportunity to try it on because it was very undersized.
3.0,"It‚Äôs ok, but more burgundy than red."
3.0,"I do have a larger chest for my body size, so maybe it's just me. But it seems the top is a little small for what it should be."
3.0,Watch is great but it does not use the pins to hold the band on. Instead the band is fastened on with some proprietary mechanism and has to be cut off.
3.0,"They are cute enough, but cardboard type material‚Ä¶ however, I reckon ya get what ya pay for! But, luckily, a good laugh was had at the concept etc. and the recipient (26 yr old female) decided they would have a place of honor on her cork board!"
3.0,"okay so for the price obviously it's great butttt i literally opened it and one of the center pieces completely fell out! luckily i have a friend who makes jewelry so she was able to fix it for me, but buyers beware!! it's very cheaply made!"
3.0,"These headbands fit well and don't slide while working out. However, I would not say that they are worth the price. You can find similar items for half of the price."
3.0,"weird fit, cute but not for my body, and quite frankly not sure if its for anyones."
3.0,Brim was a bit to &#34;floppy&#34;.  Will not hold its shape.
3.0,Quality seemed good but they caused a skin reaction almost immediately.
3.0,My husband is not typically a 3X and especially in a t-shirt but I wanted him to be comfortable so got a 3X.  It fit like a regular 1X BEWARE!  It wasn't comfie but he still won first place.  People weren't sure if he was a work disposable coffee cup though! :) GREAT FUN!
3.0,Nice looking watch. Light weight for its size sort of feels like plastic. Shipping was excruciatingly long and not sure why when other items come so quickly. All in all it about falls right in line with the price paid. Cant expect much more for the price.
3.0,"This is a beautiful shirt, but slightly different than pictured.<br />It does NOT fit everyone. I am 5'11&#34; and 240 pounds and wear size 16/18 or XL in shirts. This shirt goes just to my waist, like the picture in the customer photos. The arm holes are too small and are probably positioned  in the wrong place. The material is thin. I think this shirt will work best if you're on the smaller side; if you want it to hang like in the product description photos. My photos are of packaging, front, and back. It came in a bubble wrap mailer, enclosed in a clear plastic bag.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,This product doesn't fit well after washing
3.0,Look exactly like advertised.  I have a larger head and they fit comfortably with no issue.<br /><br />Haven't had an opportunity to try them in bright sun just yet but will update when I do!
3.0,"I did receive it at around the time estimate that was stated. It comes from China so it did take quite a number of weeks. When I received the package I thought that maybe there was only one blouse in it. No, all three blouses where contained in that 20 inch by about 18 inch package. This is because the material is very thin. Not see thru but a very light jersey knit. The colors were just as pictured and so was the cut and style. The only thing is was not too pleased with was the lace detail. It was sewn on very carelessly (it couldn't have been because it was done quickly because it took almost a month to arrive). If I didn't sew I would be quite upset. It seems like it was sewn inside out. the edges of the lace are on the outside instead of the inside. I will have to take the time to pull it apart and re-sew it carefully. Other than that I am pleased with it.Ive yet to wear them because I want to sew them first, im afraid the lace will rip if I try putting them on. So I will save my review of wearing them for later."
3.0,They are cool boots but the heel does not feel stable
3.0,This scarf is not what I intended for it to look like. The length and texture of the scraf I hate but the colors are fine.
3.0,It‚Äôs nothing Maxie about the dress. It is not as long as the picture makes it seem
3.0,Cheap plastic but they fit well.
3.0,"Advertised as adjustable but it's not. I fashioned an adjustable cord from some brown leather shoelaces. I especially like the spikes used for the cross. i would have given it 5 stars if it was adjutable. If you're looking for a choker, then this will work just fine."
3.0,"This jacket was received in a totally crumpled state. I figured it would hang out. But after about a week, I gave in and ironed per manufacturer directions. It was for naught as the wrinkles just come back.<br /><br />I sized up to a large based on reviews and it fits pretty well except the basic cut is terrible. The belt is too high and rather than loops there is a sleeve in the back to thread the very slippery belt through.  It's very hard to tell when it's flat because the material flows like mercury.  I secured the belt with safety pins, but I will probably just pull it out and make due with the zipper which is where the lack of cute comes in.  The belt is just too high, and I'm not saying that because I'm tall or long in the torso because I'm not.  Since the belt doesn't sit at my waist, it is difficult just to tie closed.  Also the front of the jacket with this quicksilver's fabric immediately slides open.  It can be zipped, but that's not nearly as convenient running in, out, and about for errands.<br /><br />So the good part, it works.  It keeps me dry. The hood is large with a brim, and nuthin is going through the fabric any time soon.  Because it physically does its job, I gave it 3 stars."
3.0,"The material and construction of the mask is good, it seems to be satin-like or shiny polyester fabric.<br />it has a nose wire which is great to help with fitting of the mask and filter pocket.<br /><br />Unfortunately,  the Big Con is that the image design on the front is too large, wish the image design was slightly smaller so the mouth and nose could be more realistic to the proportion of our face. That was disappointing because the mask itself is good and gave good coverage but if the reason you wanted this mask was to use it for costume use, I think only one of them barely passes (the one with jacks mouth slightly open) but the other two, the one with Sally's mouth has huge lips and the one with Jacks normal mouth has the Nose too high and the mouth too low it lines up on your chin area!, those just look way too overly large to work to match your actual face proportion at all :("
3.0,size up by 2. too tight. material is good. Good quality
3.0,"I wish the breast elastic area was slightly longer, I am 34DD and it it just big enough to cover the tatas. Would look cuter if it hugged slightly further down towards the waist."
3.0,I was hoping it would be smaller and a little more dainty but it‚Äôs cute
3.0,I love this mask.  Beautiful and well-made.  But only gave 3 stars because far too expensive when identical masks (just different pattern) are available for 1/2 the price.
3.0,Too small  Difficult to be able to appreciate the muramos glass
3.0,I bought these to make tie dye dresses.  The dye came out great but these dresses are choochkie short.
3.0,I really liked them but they fell apart after two wears.
3.0,I will order a med next time
3.0,Small. I don't like the fit. Material is thin.
3.0,Waist band rolled the first time I wore it and shrunk when I washed it
3.0,the pants are too short.
3.0,"Yes she loved it, but one of the charms has fallen off. üòû"
3.0,I am unable to return the item because it is outside the window. I never wore the item because it was simply to big and didn‚Äôt look cute or stylish.
3.0,Nice shoes but wrong size and model as you can see in pic.<br />The one in correct size fits true to size.
3.0,It‚Äôs a cute outfit for summer. Some of the threads were loosened with the first wash. Not as well made as it could be but adequate for a toddler.
3.0,"I really like the fit and how cute it is. HOWEVER, the fabric is REALLY thin. I tried to wear a dark bra and you could see it through the shirt- and it really wasn't tight. So I don't wear this shirt without a tank underneath. I don't recommend this unless you're willing  to wear an undershirt of some kind - if you are, then its a cute shirt."
3.0,its good but they didn't send me the right color i ordered lmfao
3.0,"This dress is very very cute. Fits smaller to true to size. However, the material is thin and almost see through but is fine with some cartwheel shorts underneath. Wrinkles easily."
3.0,Tama√±o muy grande para ni√±os de 5 a√±os.
3.0,"Picture looks like thin  flowing fabric but it's not.  It's more like a thick t-shirt. Will be a sweater I wear at home, only."
3.0,"i asked the wife after she had the sox on over night with temps of 40 above , an she sead it was the same as regular sox ."
3.0,I would have kept it but the neckline was crooked- it was OBVIOUS- one side was shorter than the other.
3.0,"It was not sterling silver, it looks so different in the picture. It looks like an ordinary bracelet<br />I gave it 3 stars because it arrived on time"
3.0,Hoped it would have been cuter than it was. Fits large and looks kind of cheap. I returned after trying two sizes.
3.0,very hard for me to put on--age plus+
3.0,Muy peque√±o el producto
3.0,"I followed the size chart. In t-shirts I wear a small, in dresses I wear a medium, my cup size is a 34B/34C, my waist size is 27 inches. I have shoulders the same width as my hips and had to slowly put one shoulder and shoulder blade at a time through the waist band before inserting my head very last. There is None, Zilch, Nada stretch in the waistband, so unless you want to snap the ""elastic"" within the waistband or install your own elastic or were born without shoulders, best of luck putting this on."
3.0,Dress size was way off. Too big
3.0,I would have liked this piece larger.
3.0,"I like this, but it's not a barrette, it's a swim suit top. I'll keep it for that use, but between the material and the large brass closure in the back, it is certainly a swim suit top. Although I may be risking some funky tan lines, I will wear it for that purpose! Just isn't art all a bralette."
3.0,I ordered my typical size and the product was super tight. Returned it and reordered to see what a size up would do.
3.0,"The sizing is not as described. They list waist sizes, so I ordered the 30, but they shipped me a M and an L. The Medium was close enough so I kept it. But the Large was too big so I returned it for a refund. The shorts themselves are decent, but it looks like someone in the shipping department is guessing at which sizes to send you. Because of that I won't be ordering more."
3.0,Husband didn't care for it but he didn't want to send it back - he will gift it to grandson
3.0,The skirt rips so easily. Cheap made. Corset ran super small and after two returns they still sent me the wrong size.
3.0,Arrived today but unlike the other reviews my 2 sets of earrings arrived in a small and then larger plastic bags not in the nice velvet pouch the other reviews spoke about... They are pretty... Definitely not ready to give as gifts.
3.0,Band not stretchable just the cover. Returned product
3.0,They get really hot from the speaker
3.0,i'd rate 5 stars but i honestly dunno what to stick in this thing i bought this to spread the bulk out height wise instead of width wiose but dunno how to make it all fit properly.  i need help haha! my backpack doesn't go out width wise only height wise...
3.0,It looks nice but it smells disgusting.
3.0,"The gloves go up higher than pictured. They go up to my elbows, like the title says, but the photo is misleading. That's okay, I can just scrunch them down. The other thing I do not like is that while I knew they would be satin-like material, I did not know that they would also be sparkly. The material looks slightly glittery. Not a fan of that because these are for a specific costume, but it's not worth it to return them. Other than that, these are pretty much exactly what you'd expect -- the types of gloves you'd see in a costume store around Halloween. Decent quality and I can tell they're not going to fall apart or anything."
3.0,"I ordered a 4/6. Im 5&#34;3 130 lbs. A cup, 29inch waist 42 inch hips. My husband liked it. I gained some weight and my stomach isn't as flat as I like. But it still looked good. The top was a little big. But i will sew the sides or pin it to make it tighter. I rated it average because the material was not faux suede. It was more like a thin spandex."
3.0,"Was satisfied with neck piece, but head piece is too tight"
3.0,"I feel like this ran big on try on, it was also pretty see through. I wanted to love this dress. The sleeves and neckline are great feminine features."
3.0,I bought size M and had to return it. Top needs to be a couple of sizes bigger. I was not able to put it on.
3.0,"I gave this dress the benefit of the doubt and ended up disappointed. I ordered a size up and it is still very short. What I liked the least was how loose the top part of the dress is. I really wanted to like this dress. It's very cute, just not made right."
3.0,"Too large, but he will grow into them. A little longer than I expected."
3.0,"Comfortable,  not as long as I had expected,  but larger would be too big.  Not exactly great quality,  the seems are weirdly located.  The white one has the labels sewn on the outside... back... of sweater,  I'm afraid to remove it as it may rip. May just return."
3.0,"They are cute, but much too small for what I needed them for."
3.0,My 9 year old needed a mask to wear to day camp. He chose these because he liked the patterns and design. They fall right off his face because they are too large by about 1.5 inches. I'm buying some elastic to sew into the tops of these so he can use them.
3.0,Button was missing this was a birthday gift
3.0,Wish it came 1 size larger.
3.0,"Would have been perfect except zipper is completely crooked so it appears very cheap (which really, it is).  I guess you get why you pay for here, it‚Äôs comfortable, the color is pretty, the material is soft and I am able to use it as a nursing top since the zipper comes down far enough."
3.0,"The quality and shape, as well as the alignment of stripes was disappointing, so I returned it.  Perhaps it the pattern was not a stripe,...?  but I was most disappointed with the large round neck line, which is not flattering on me."
3.0,"Nice, smaller and shot we than I expected."
3.0,Do the job for the price but the fingers are all the same length so my pinky stuck way out.
3.0,"The watch is aesthetically pleasing, however the build quality isn't that great given the price. The wrist strap feels like it's made out of cheap vinyl, it squeaks when you walk and just feels awful. You could replace it, but out of the box a $500 watch strap shouldn't feel like something you got at chuck-e-cheese's."
3.0,They fit a little tight for people with hips... I recommend getting a size larger.
3.0,"Lovely earrings, unfortunately broke the first day I wore it"
3.0,The title of this neck gaiter says wind proof it is not wind proof. I purchased it to wear with an open face helmet on my British MC so it has the look I was going for just not the weight for cooler fall days.
3.0,Cute! But too large for myself.
3.0,"Canvas is of decent quality but ‚Äúleather‚Äù straps on the side buckles and parts of the handles is cheap almost plastic looking. I‚Äôm sure after carrying the weight of the full bag with the handles they will tear soon. Not bad for the price though.  I would give it five stars if they would change out that cheap pleather for something more sturdy.  A comparison photo of the picture from the advertisement to the one I received, notice the difference in the leather straps!!"
3.0,Returned because it was too loose at the offset.  I could foresee them getting too loose to wear in the near future
3.0,"The fit is actually pretty good, but for me the placement of the knee pads was very very low in the legs, making me wonder if these were shin pads? I mean, nobodies knees are that low :D<br />You can't pull them higher and have it be an old fashioned high waist thing as they are very much a below the waist kind of fit, which I prefer, but there's no room in the crotch to do this.. It also hoists the leg cuff too high, so again, I have to presume they're just stitched in too low.<br />Only solution I can think of to do is, fabric glue or stitch across the knee pocket to force the pad to be a few inches higher. It might mean they poke out of the interior pocket, but it's a tight fit anyway and I don't think they'll move.<br />Would prefer no stitching visible access the knee, so they actually just look like regular jeans.<br /><br />Fit's true to size, and the waist is slightly elasticated.<br />Kevlar reinforced sections are minimal, but seem of good quality. Would like to see some in the shin area, but there is none.<br /><br />At this price they're a steal, but they need the pockets altering for me.<br />I eventually used a liquid stitch latex fabric glue and measured where the pads would need to be, and marked that place.<br />Believe it or not, to have the knee pads articulate correctly in place over my kneecap, I had to glue the bottom 4 inches of knee pad pocket off. Now they sit at the right level.<br />They're a loose fit jean though, so really in a crash situation, I can't see this doing much of anything other that squidging to one side or the other, and so it won't offer much protection.<br />You can purchase strap on knee protection that would fit much more correctly, and is removable and works on any pants, but still.. I wanted to see if I could get these working somewhat."
3.0,"This dress is a great idea, but the skirt part of the dress is very stiff. I thought that washing it might help but it did not - the fabric is still very stiff and holds wrinkles."
3.0,"Very nice print and material! However, size up if you want to be able to wear it like the model."
3.0,"These are perfect when first put on, but stretch out quickly in the day and look funny."
3.0,Nice jacket but they sent the wrong size
3.0,"Nice, bright light. Why not 5 stars? It simply wouldn't turn off the second time we turned it on."
3.0,the product came in a smashed box but inside boxes fine mdse is not a good fit and it hurts on ear and not adjustable
3.0,purchased for me I am small build but tailored for a very tiny person
3.0,"The fabric isn‚Äôt the highest quality, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd wear this to a nice dinner. More like a dark nightclub setting where nobody really sees you. I like how the back is completely covered, though, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about an exposed bra. The cheap manufacturing is really evident in the skirt at the side seams. The sequins on the seams stick out because the fabric was quickly sewn together, and they weren‚Äôt snipped off, but I can go in with a pair of nail scissors or something and clean that up myself."
3.0,"Many places that sell this module claim that the USB port can be used to charge a Li-ion battery that is connected to the the battery tabs on the board.  DO NOT DO THIS!!!  The battery tabs are directly connected to the the +/- of the USB input so you would be putting unregulated, non-current limited, 5 volts directly on your 3.7 volt battery.  The upside is that you can put up to +5 volts directly on the battery tabs instead of using the USB input.<br /><br />As for remembering the last song played, that doesn't work with a plain flash drive.  It does work if you plug in an MP3 player like an old iPod Nano but that's because the iPod does the ""remembering""."
3.0,"Loved it at first and then in blew out the first card pocket, lasted 4 months. Great design, just wish it was sturdier"
3.0,"The bracelet is very nice, but I didn't receive the rose gold clasp to it, just the sterling silver. Too bad, I would have liked it even more."
3.0,"This dress is very cute and well made, especially for the price. However, it is too big."
3.0,Serves purpose. Issue with Face being made from cardboard. There was a tear in it within a day
3.0,I love the look of these glasses but they are way too big and don‚Äôt fit right so they get heavy causing ear pain and just plain irritating to wear.  Really bummed about that.
3.0,Gorgeous material and cut well. Sizing was on the mark. Only issue is that the moon phase transfer(design along spine)sits down way too low. Could enhance the effect of this shirt greatly if maker would place the moon phase spinal chakra design up higher on the shirt. The beauty of this design gets lost as is.
3.0,"Let me say first of all that I love Vionic footwear.  This sandal did not look as good on my foot as I had hoped.  I will wear them, but I don't love the way they look."
3.0,Hat is heavy.
3.0,Will shrink in the wash. Beware
3.0,"A little short, so I don't wear it much. I'm 5'2&#34;."
3.0,Just very cheap looking and feeling so not a great ‚Äúkeepsake‚Äù gift.
3.0,"This is cute, but a little see-through."
3.0,Cute mask! But be aware it's pre-teen/child size.
3.0,they look dull after a few wears.  not as bright as they were at first/appear tarnished and don't shine up
3.0,Ordered the black bling band and it has more blue and purple glitter than black... Not what I was expecting/wanting.
3.0,Nice gown for any Batman fan but the pink ruffles are stiff and seem uncomfortable. Hopefully they will soften after a few washes.
3.0,"I thought they would be more like &#34;leggings&#34; but they are more like thick tights. That said, they fit great and don't fall down, like some of my other &#34;tights&#34;. They are nice and thick and soft so you could def wear them as leggings. But I would def wear under a dress or longer tunic only."
3.0,Very pretty but the silver one arrived broken and appeared to be packed like that. Disappointed
3.0,"These water sandals offer good cushioning and thick soles, but they also are very wide and have limited adjusting options. The fabric by the ankles make them easier to pull when they're wet. The third-grader who is wearing these likes orange, but this felt a little too neon/bright for him."
3.0,Had this product for a few months and one of the two zippers has broken off.
3.0,"We bought this for family pictures but the shirt is not a true white, it‚Äôs blueish or dingey colored as if it‚Äôs been washed several times. I tried to show in the photo the difference between it and my son‚Äôs WHITE shirt."
3.0,"Love it - BUT it's about 5-8 sizes too small.  The picture makes it look loose, but maybe the model is xxxsmall.  I decided to give it to a friend as a gift rather than go to all the trouble of returning it."
3.0,Bought for my labret piercing not realizing that the post has a ball back for the inside of the mouth. My fault but not ideal for my piercing.  Also they are too short to even try to wear. Biggest thing being the package I received says 14g and the online description says 16g.. hopefully I can return these or give them to someone else who can actually use them as they would be a nice piece of jewelry to wear for a different piercing.
3.0,they look really cheap.
3.0,"I like the style and it being a dual time watch.  However, I was just able to use it for a few days because the battery went dead and underneath the strap it started coming off."
3.0,Nicely made - but will dislodge from clasp on rough use - like climbing - back pack setting etc.<br />A drop of srong wood glue on both clasps to hold the leather in will do wonders
3.0,"Great size and shape, just a bit heavy"
3.0,The bracelet looks better in the photo:  it is plastic and looks it.  It runs quite big so it slips off my teen daughter's wrist.  My bracelet has blue beads between the skulls which look a bit cheesy.
3.0,Soft... Long legs.. thinner then expected
3.0,Somewhat small and short
3.0,"Very nice looking and decent quality, but the sizing is probably 2 sizes off in terms of bust width (get two sizes larger... eg if you are normally a 38 in US bra sizes I‚Äôd get a 42).  And one size up in cup size (If you are a C, get a D).  It is ok to wear for an evening out but I would have horrible cut marks if I tried wearing it all day!"
3.0,The package was very poor . The watch case was wet inside. Kind of tear apart . But the watch was very nice and useful. I wish I had better package.
3.0,"It is loose, but its also poorly cut."
3.0,"The reviews are correct. It runs very small, and it hangs funny with the pockets swinging to the back.  However, i bought it anyway and i like it in the office. I bought the scoop neck shirt to match and they look good together. Color is bright and pretty. Material is soft and drapey. The strange hang, i got used to pretty quickly. I only wear it with the matching shirt though, because the shoulders shift outwards when I move but the matching shirt magically keeps the jacket shoulders in place."
3.0,"Too small in breast, but was a gift so to late to return"
3.0,The skirt is SUPER tutu and it's rather itchy to a 4 year old!  I think its adorable but maybe just for dress up and not actually going to dance class?
3.0,Came way too big and shirt was a completely different size... but I worked my magic and she looks super cute in them.
3.0,"The SOFTEST leggings ever! I love these so much, unfortunately I ordered an XS and they‚Äôre too short. I am 5‚Äô7, 112lbs and usually wear a 24. Other than the length, the fit was incredible! Would only size up for length!"
3.0,"Material is pretty solid but the click is not good, its easy to fell off"
3.0,Beautiful band but it was falling apart on one end when I took it out. I realized it was due to a missing pin. I really wanted to love this band and I don't feel like going through the hassle of sending it back so I literally had to pay more money for pins. I would've ordered more bands from this company because I love to accesorize but now I don't want to risk it.
3.0,"very cute, but it didn't cover my boobs at all unfortunately. i am 32d and there is no way i could wear this in public"
3.0,They are really nice just to big for my nose.
3.0,"I bought this style dress from a couple of other sellers and always got an XL, but this seller's XL was a bit big.  The dress is doable, but  I would have preferred it to be slightly more form fitting.  I don't want to waste my time sending it back, so I'll work with it. The dress is also very long.  If you're short, like me, get it hemmed or just lift it up, as you're walking, because it definitely drags.  In any case, just know that it runs a little big.  Now, let's get to the arm part. I'm talking about that ruffle sleeve part that goes around your arm.  EXTREMELY tight.  I don't even have big arms, and the elastic feels like it's cutting off circulation.  You can't have XS sleeves on an XL dress, even if there is elastic.  Hopefully the elastic will eventually give way and make it more comfortable to wear around the arm.  The material. Eh'.  I'm not too excited about it feeling like 100% polyester.  It has a shiny look to it.  Not too shiny.  It's a subtle shine, but it's still a shine.  Would I buy this dress again from this seller?  No."
3.0,"My blue ones had 2 tiny holes in them, I didnt want to return because I liked them and figured one just had the 2 tiny holes so I kept them ! After washing they collect little white fuzz balls on them ! But for 12 dollars can't complain! They also shrank their 1st wash, so b careful!!! I don't mind them being a little short!!!"
3.0,"It‚Äôs wearable but it has a very, very, very weird fit. Even though it adjusts in the back it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúadjust‚Äù or feel natural. The fabric is super thin. I‚Äôm exchanging for a larger size to see if it provides a better fit, but I‚Äôm thinking it might be the fabric and design. Might work for someone with a smaller chest."
3.0,"It dress does not fit as expected, I ordered a size bigger. I ordered a Medium instead of a small. It's an ok material. I probably will not buy it when I see it at the store."
3.0,When I opened the package the odor was crazy ü§¢ . Once I tried it on it was really cute but you def want to wear a strapless bra with it if you have a bigger chest cause there is no support. And def wear spankies or leggings cause the doors go up to your chest.
3.0,Rise in pants is terribly short<br />Nice style<br />Well made
3.0,Cuter in the picture.  Looked pretty cheap in person and too had no support.  Bottom seemed like a different size than the top.
3.0,Looks nice but it is not curved at all. It‚Äôs extremely straight so it looks kind of funny. I was hoping to wear it for an Audrey Hepburn costume but I don‚Äôt think I will be keeping it:/ Does come in a cute box though
3.0,"definitely not stainless steel, cool looking ring tho, also the ring has a fake marking of .925 which is used for silver rings which this definitely isn‚Äôt, probably just from a mold of a real silver ring"
3.0,Huge!  Runs very very large.
3.0,"Cute top.  Only thing I would say are the strings are too long around the waist but, not a big deal to cut and stitch the ends so they don‚Äôt fray."
3.0,"Beautiful but, Not true to the size:( runs about 2 sizes smaller than your normal size"
3.0,Picture gave impression it was a lot longer than it turned out to be -  vendor easy to work with regarding return they gave me a 60% credit and I did not have to return which was good because I live in a rural area
3.0,"Beautiful, but the quality of the earrings makes my ears hurt! Returned them :("
3.0,Not very warm and very small for me.  I wear a men‚Äôs size 9
3.0,"Cute shirt. I looked at the sizing and ordered the Large. I normally wear an XL, but I figured that's what the sizing recommended. When I tried it on it was too tight on the bust and did not look nice and loose as pictured. I returned mine as soon as I got it. If you purchase it, I recommend sizing up from their chart."
3.0,"Typically this brand fits me perfect, but I guess this gladiator style just didn't work for me. The heel portion made the shoe uncomfortable and felt too small. Was disappointed because they are so darn cute!"
3.0,I ordered this dress in a 4T for my 4.5 year old. I'd say she's pretty average size and 4T pretty much always fits but the top of this dress was huge on her.  I don't think it would even fit my 6 year old niece. I don't see any other reviews stating that it runs big so maybe I just got a defective one? Aside from sizing it's pretty cute. Not the absolute highest of quality but not terrible either.
3.0,"This was supposed to be large and rigid, but it's not either.  This will fit in what I consider to be a medium sized purse and it is only slightly more rigid than the last organizer I purchased.  Not worth $15.  :("
3.0,"Still love the overall fit of these pants, but the fabric...not so much. They really have a ""pilling"" problem, after only one wear and wash. Not the same fabric as the pattered ones they sell."
3.0,"Got a size Small. 5'3"" 130lbs. I wasn't happy with this dress at all. I didn't like the fit through the body, along the chest, along the shoulders. It was a big loose dress that just had too much extra, unnecessary fabric up top. Also it doesn't really show off your figure as much as it hides it. I wasn't happy with the fit hem or cut."
3.0,I had no problem with the construction or the materials I just didn‚Äôt like the white zipper. I did end up returning this product only because I did not like the white zipper.
3.0,"The wrap appears far more simple than the picture elludes, but it is quite soft."
3.0,"Fits well on my short 5'2'' frame and it worked well on my 7-8 month pregnant belly, but you get what you pay for. The material is quite thin and pilled after one wash. Still worth it to get me through with my baby bump. Wore is many times with a cardigan for work."
3.0,Really cheap product and didn‚Äôt last for a long time.
3.0,"I order these hoping for at least half animal prints seeing as two prints were listed.  I was really disappointed when I opened them to find not just heart and animal prints but plaid, and emojis, and several other prints that are not animal or heart related. If you're wanting those prints look for something else. If you don't mind getting a bunch of other prints, the bracelets are pretty good for the price."
3.0,"I've had this ring for maybe a year or more now? I've lost 2 of the gemstones to everyday wear and tear. I understand that the ring is cheap and I shouldn't hold high expectations, but it's still a bummer. I do still wear the ring because I like the pattern and metal. Stainless steal is a great option for all y'alls who are too lazy to polish up your silver."
3.0,"This winder is comprised of two parts, (1) the winder itself, and (2) the software &#34;app&#34; that is required to set it up.<br /><br />The winder is pretty decent.  The &#34;app&#34; (I use the iphone version) is flat out terrible.  The good news is that you don't have to use it very often. Once the winder is &#34;set up&#34; and left powered on, you do not need to open or use the app for anything.  Set up of a new unit means opening the app, moving the phone very close to the unit (it connects over short range bluetooth), selecting the winder, and then selecting the watch and/or TPD.  Once that it set, you can close the app, never open it again, remove it from your phone, whatever.  At this point, whenever the door is closed, the unit will rotate per the TPD settings and it operates in &#34;dumb&#34; mode, which is fine.<br /><br />Given the price, I would rate this as a decent value.  It would be a 4 if the app wasn't a disaster."
3.0,Came bent and crooked....Otherwise I like it
3.0,The Hat does not match the picture shown on the website. The hat is black with silver accents. Still 3 stars because I like the low profile fit and it was comfortable
3.0,"Soft, fits good but stitching won‚Äôt last long. Not good quality :("
3.0,"Yes they are great at quieting your surroundings. And look awesome. But they are super tight and not adjustable. I have a small head for an adult, my eye glasses are petite. But they hurt me and didnt come down to cover my whole ear. And fit my 8 year olds head in a similar fashion. He is autistic and I wanted to take him to a monster truck show and have him enjoy it. I was hoping these would help hil gain some confidence and feel more secure in a loud, crowded environment and be able to enjoy himself and the event. And I was hoping he would have these for years to come.... I'm afraid they are a 1 time use and I'll have to find a better pair. But they are cute!"
3.0,These hose look nice but slide down a little as I walk.
3.0,Picture looks prettier‚Ä¶this is just an iron on
3.0,"It's decent quality, but the men's large didn't fit across my hips and I'm only a size 8/10 (US size) woman.  Definitely runs small."
3.0,Nice material but ordered 2xl usual size too tight! Will not buy this brand again and will give shirt away.
3.0,They're not as large as I would have preferred.
3.0,To tight around the waste and to big in the butt.
3.0,Love this! Wish there was one more smaller size though! Anyone smaller then a size 8/10 a small wouldn't really fit
3.0,Need a size larger than I received. Way To much compression.
3.0,Runs small on top. Can't zip. I even purchased larger size and still small. Love design and pattern.
3.0,The product description says sequin so I expected sequins. They just have glitter on them. Which I must say does fall off. The material is real nice and they do fit well.
3.0,To long 5ft 1 173 it was really to long.
3.0,Everything was fine besides the nose rest. See pic.
3.0,I love the material the shirt is made from I like how the shirt feels on your torso the only thing is the sleeves are to loose they should tighten up the criss cross on the sleeves
3.0,"This is a very sexy dress, but don't expect to wear anything under it. The dresses material is VERY thin and the dress is ultimately see though. This is great for a swim suit cover-up but that's about it. The fit was good however."
3.0,"Cute design and good dimensions, the only thing is that it is see through, but other than that very nice!"
3.0,They don't stay on well because they are so thin and low. Nice and light though!
3.0,"got these for my hubby. he loved them at first. very comfortable and cushy sole. but after 4 months, the fabric on the footbed is unravelling and hubby says the sole has flattened out so  it no longer cushions."
3.0,The earrings are pretty but are hard to keep on your ears unless you have really skinny earlobes.  They just kind of hang really low on your ears.
3.0,Very cheap feel to it but thats what I was looking for. I dont carry my checks with me anymore so I just wanted something to keep them in at home. Works great.
3.0,Dress was beautiful.  The only issue we has was that when they sewed the bottom and top pieces together it wasn't a straight line so some of the dress puckered.
3.0,This shirt runs extremely small and unlike the model is more of a crop top. I would order at least two sizes up if you want it to resemble the picture in any hopes. Needless to say it is going back.
3.0,After about 5 washes it has started to vome undone at the seam.
3.0,"I have a few other dresses from this brand and love them. The quality is good and all, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a flattering style for my age (27) and body."
3.0,I love them and they fit great. Unfortunately my buttons are sewn on the inside.
3.0,works fine band worst part.
3.0,"Love the material, but fits a little big."
3.0,the buckle release could use improvement--does not release eseily.
3.0,Fit a little big ordered a medium doses have a size on it felt like an extra large but over all cute
3.0,It‚Äôs okay. More blueish than copper
3.0,Sheds a ton!
3.0,"Cute, runs big in the waist area. Lenght is good. I had to send iy back."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:66b74f1dfbdde4b9671c23c08e79e91c]] My son is only a month old and they are tight on his little ankles . I‚Äôd say these are only meant for newborns. If your baby has chunky ankles this isn‚Äôt what you want . I‚Äôm super bummed ! They‚Äôre so soft and very cute ! Luckily my sister in law is having a baby I can just pass them down to her! Not worth to pay this much and baby not be able to use them ! If they‚Äôd fix the ankle issue I‚Äôd give them all 5 stars !!!
3.0,"It's a nice wig, but the peak on the forehead isn't there (a huge reason I went with this one). And there are randomly two VERY long pieces in the front."
3.0,"This is a lovely, soft knit, with handy side-pockets.  It was just what I was looking for but, sadly, it was a bit too big.  Moreover, it was way too long."
3.0,Nice Tshirt but way smaller than regular sizes. Large more like medium or small.
3.0,"The size and fit and look were exactly as expected. Very pretty dress. However, the material feels nothing like cotton. It is itchy, not breathable at all, and hot as all heck. I was sweating as soon as I put it on just to try it on. Wore it today and while it was very nice it was NOT something I would wear in the summer again (which is what I purchased it for). Could not wait to peel it off at the end of the day.  I‚Äôm keeping it and I‚Äôll wear it in winter with some leggings."
3.0,Looks nice and nice size on the neck<br /><br />However I thought it can‚Äôt with more than one<br /><br />It came with one necklace
3.0,It's bigger.It doesn't fit me very well
3.0,The shorts are fine but I was disappointed with the lining. The lining is very loose and I was expecting it to be a little more compression type. The phone pocket in the lining is okay but again because it is loose it is about the same as having the phone in an outer pocket.
3.0,These shorts are a bit bulky in the padding but it does help. Not as sore as I used to be the day after a ride.
3.0,"It‚Äôs a nice looking bag. Used it at the beach first day to carry some towels and clothes. Worked great.<br /><br />Took it to work second day, and the stitching at the bottom of the bag broke just from holding some plastic aircraft wands. They are very smooth and blunt without a sharp edge or point on them. Was very surprised that the wands would be enough to break stitching.<br /><br />It is a nice looking product though, but only meant to carry flimsy things like clothes or towels.<br /><br />Luckily, I got refunded easily. Could be I just got a defective bag but I didn‚Äôt want to risk buying it again."
3.0,"Good little cap, has a nice feel to it."
3.0,Runs small in the crotch area.  Fabric is a bit thin.  Only wore it once.
3.0,"I ordered according to their size charts, and this is huge on me.  Arg."
3.0,"I love the color and feel of this jacket.  It is an excellent length.  However, it is slim cut through the hips and pulls awkwardly. I ordered a size up so that it would be a bigger jacket, but it's not.  I almost think that if I cut out the lining it would be a better product.  The lining of the jacket is what makes it too slim.  Then, the outer coat material is bulky in places.  I kept it because I was going on a trip and needed a long, warm coat.  However, its next trip is to a tailor who may be able to make it a better product."
3.0,"I like the look of these sunglasses but, I thought they would be wider."
3.0,Not University Red<br />Screen print logo
3.0,If these glasses were slightly bigger in size and the frame shape was more rectangular and narrow this would be 5 stars.
3.0,"Good material for the tie and pocket square, but the tie is not mint green. I agree with another reviewer who says it is more of a sage green than mint green. Will sadly be returning because of this. The hunt continues for a matching tie..."
3.0,"I ordered this in a Medium. I wear a 36 C, however I should say a 36 C long. After kids and losing a significant amount of weight I have to admit I have quite a sag. I went from a 40 DD to 36 C. Unfortunately the cups on this are too close together. There was not coverage on the sides, even if my breasts would have fit into it, the tasteful side boob was not so tasteful. I am going to try a large and see if there is more coverage. I will share more info once I receive it.<br />If you have any sag, please order a size up."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, and my daughter loves it, but it definitely had to be tailored. The straps were too long, and the top was quite wide."
3.0,Just took it out of the bag and there is a hole in them.  They look comfy but...not sure how to get a replacement?
3.0,"Cute, but it's not long enough to be considered a scarf. It is now tied to my door knob"
3.0,Orange color is too red
3.0,Really cute earrings. But it arrived without an earring back to hold the earring in place.
3.0,"For an XL, it was not large enough in the actual cup to cover my chest. Ended up giving to a friend who is a C cup and it fit her much better than  me. Nice product, but not if you have a larger chest."
3.0,"I liked the style of the hat. Unfortunately, the color of the hat was listed as orange but the actual color was more of a coral. I really like Wallaroo hats and will be on the lookout for another new hat!"
3.0,Beautiful Bracelet. too small.
3.0,"Very thin fabric, single layer, no filter pocket, ear loops are not elastic, no metal band to form/bend over your nose."
3.0,nice green color
3.0,"Easy to replace,affordable and comfortable but stains horribly.. I have one in teal and in less than a week it looks as though I've had the band for years, I work in an office setting and wore it at the gym regularly normal things that didn't expose it to dirt or anything and yet it stained and won't come clean. I would purchase a dark color so you won't notice any staining"
3.0,Ordered this a few time and each time arrived cracked or scratched. Need to boxed it up insted
3.0,"I like this necklace. It is nice, but it has a funny metal smell to it that I really dont like. And when my man wants to kiss on me, why would he want to smell dirty yucky metal?? :) Nice necklace, but dont like the smell."
3.0,"My daughter doesn‚Äôt have to struggle with a buckle, but it‚Äôs a pain to put in or take out, the ends are wide, plus the metal clip that adjusts the size scratches"
3.0,I bought this since I need to be seen at night while I ride my electric skateboard. This jacket does exactly as it says and help me be seen but the sizing is off by a lot. I bought a medium and this is no way close. I actually can't wear it.  Unfortunately I took the tags off and only wore it once. Stupid on my part. I'd buy again but aware of the sizing. Maybe I got a mislabled one.
3.0,Too loose and feels like they‚Äôre flat even though there‚Äôs an arch.
3.0,I went with the sizing as it stated and this coat was just way too big. This style isn't supposed to be snug but too much bulk just isn't cute. Had to return. The coat itself is cute but just wasn't the right size. I found a similar style at Old Navy and kept that one instead.
3.0,"Fit is fine, but the material itself feels a little coarse. I am hoping that additional laundering will soften the material and make it more comfortable."
3.0,I really liked the watch. It worked just like advertised.. for about a month. Literally one day after the return window closed it broke. So now I have a watch that I spent 60+ dollars on that does not work. Just be cautious.
3.0,"The ring and flower itself are a little small/thin band. The material is a nice metal, I think, my finger doesn't turn green when I wear it. I like the silver/red combination. Seems a little costume-jewelry but its really good for the price."
3.0,Esta muy peque√±a
3.0,"A bit longer than it would suggest in the stock photos. Also, colors aren‚Äôt as vibrant in person, ‚Äúpink‚Äù is more like soft peach. Fit is kinda weird, fits in the arms but snug bodice. Material is definitely thicker. Confirmed that it‚Äôs not the same as the one in the pic... actually found and ordered the actual one in the pic and it‚Äôs a drastic difference in material, fit, length, and color."
3.0,Very pretty  earrings but much small than I expected. The earring is the size of a dime and is quite delicate looking -- it would be stunning if larger and bolder. Still they are original and very artistic in execution so I will keep them and wear them.
3.0,"It‚Äôs a good product, but I‚Äôm giving it a 3-star review because of durability issues. I bought it in December and two months later, the right pocket zipper ripped fantastically when I was just trying to open it to get my phone. Since I just missed the return window time, I can‚Äôt do anything about it, but it‚Äôs something to consider when getting this pair."
3.0,"I like the material and the slight stretch in the pants. The yellow color from the pic is off. It‚Äôs more of a bumblebee yellow, which is too bright for me. My bra or under shirt can be seen through the top which means I‚Äôll always have to wear a dark tshirt. It‚Äôs quite comfy and I may buy another, just a  darker color ."
3.0,I thought this dress was okay. The material was thin and I did not think it was very flattering.
3.0,"very cute, some of the sticking was frayed is my only complaint"
3.0,"They work for outside the pool but once in the pool, they easily feel of my child's foot."
3.0,"I ordered an XL and I wear a 36DDD bra and around a size 14 shirt.<br /><br />The bra fit looser in the back, but I wasn't expecting it to have such a deep V cut. I wear it to the gym when I'm not doing high impact training. Good if you are not as busty. If you are busty, you might be in danger of one of the girls popping out."
3.0,Nice mask but the fit is uncomfortable.
3.0,Enough bling for nightwear.  I bought a rose blingy  watch that goes well with it.  Very showy.
3.0,"Too small to get on my wrist.  I'd have to grease up my hand to get in on my wrist, but I do have big hands.  I was able to get in on, but I was really wiggling it to get it past my thumb. The band is pretty thin too.  Doesn't look bad though, but I would like something thicker even if it did get over my wrist."
3.0,Material is not the best. Flimsy and the stitching was off didn‚Äôt him or lay right
3.0,at first it was great but after like a month the stones started falling off.
3.0,This serves as a great gift. My friend loved it. I reviewed the bracelets before giving one to him and thankfully I noticed a small issue in the quality of the yin bracelet. The white sphere has small imperfections and indentations that make it look poorly made. I kept this one so that he could enjoy the other one. I attached pictures to show what I mean. The other side is perfectly fine with a the nice look of marble I was looking for.
3.0,"I am 5'2"" and have an average size torso and I found this a tad too short in the torso. Still, this is a very nice, very flattering suit that made the most of my small bust. It also provides good coverage. I don't like swimsuits that are too revealing. Lastly, the color is pretty, and the construction is very nice. If the length works for your body type, this may be worth a look."
3.0,"Very soft on the face, and very adjustable. Would provide coverage for wider and/or larger sized faces. I'm giving it a three because, without a nose wire, I can't get a good seal above my nose. Also, it completely covers my eyes when I tilt my head down, regardless of how I adjust the straps."
3.0,This is fine for an everyday maternity dress but it's not made that well and is extremely see-through.
3.0,it broke on me
3.0,"Very cut purse and a nice size, but the strap is a buckle strap and it won't stay buckled. I had to return it."
3.0,"I love equine couture items. I have to say this one is just ok. I would buy it again, but it is just not up to par with some of the other items. My little one enjoys to ride with it. Thanks"
3.0,Outfit was cute but it had a dirty stain on the shirt
3.0,"I bought these for my husband who works from home. When they arrived, they look nothing like the picture. They are clear and very small. They say they are for men and women but they are not only tight, but the frames look smaller than the picture. I would not recommend"
3.0,It's made well and is easy to sleep in. I was disappointed when it said 1-3 pack that I only got 1 bra.
3.0,My daughter likes this
3.0,"Not the best quality, but they are cute."
3.0,Looks great. Got a lot of compliments but not very functional as shoes. Daughter‚Äôs toes kept slip out of the top of the shoe. Maybe the top part is too short.
3.0,"I'm conflicted on this review...<br />Pros: the pants were actually long enough, which doesnt happen often, especially when ordering online. The material is crazy soft.<br />Cons: it may just be my body shape, but the hemming on this fit at really awkward places. It wasnt really under my bust, but wasnt my waistline either... honestly it felt like it had reimagined where it all is supposed to be and ended up making me look even more pregnant than I already am, lol."
3.0,"I got this for a photography class (for my girlfriend). It is made of good quality, and is pretty sturdy and decorated. Its pretty nice."
3.0,Did not look like the picture at all.
3.0,This  was  a very  long time  and they  were  for  gifts.
3.0,Nice piece but the ashes vile cover is too large. Makes this necklace heavy and bulky.
3.0,I wear somewhere between a 32 and 34 D. I bought a medium and overall it was a good fit. (I wear some smalls and some mediums depending on the underbust band and the stretch of the fabric.) There was a small craftsmanship issue with one strap that caused the fabric to wrinkles a bit. The biggest problem that led me to returning it was that the pocket was far too small to fit my phone and that was the whole reason I had ordered this bra. Otherwise I liked the fit and look of the bra.
3.0,"Tried this dress in the largest regular size and it was too small. Tried it in the smallest plus size but it was too big. would cost me too much to have altered, so I will have to pass"
3.0,"They seem flimsy and light. For the price, I think I could have got a much more sturdy flip flop, like Rainbow :/"
3.0,I really liked the feel of the material but I had to return because they buttons don't fit correctly.  When buttoned there are gaps between each button so I would need to wear a tank underneath and I don't want to do that.
3.0,Got tons of compliments on this shirt but it ripped after one wash at one of the seams :(
3.0,The quality is good and the design is just like the picture shown but what I don't understand is why a kids nightgown would be dry clean only. I haven't washed it yet but will be updating this post if there is any negative effects of washing this in the delicate cycle.
3.0,"It's a watch band. After the bands that came with the watch fell apart, having this one allowed the process of wearing a watch a daily possibility again.<br />The band is more tacky feeling, so it kind of builds up dirt a bit. The metal buckle digs a bit if you do any typing, which I only do for about 9 hours a day. Applying that pressure become irritating after a while. Other than those 2 things, the band is fine."
3.0,Not septum rings they are way to small
3.0,It's small for a women's belt. Not as wide and thinner than I thought
3.0,"really stinky, smaller than I thought, kind of cheap looking,"
3.0,"Beautiful slippers, but sole is almost an inch longer than foot! (see picture, your heel ends at the end of the opening, where the row of fur starts..so everything beyond that sticks out past your foot - making it harder to walk. Also, even though slipper snuggly when you put foot in, as soon as you start walking, it slipps off easily. Together, loose fit + long sole means poor fit and it's hard to walk and keep them on your feet. FYI: I'm a 7.5, ordered 6.5-7.5 size. If you're ok with long sole, just order a full size down."
3.0,Good fit. Shorter than shown
3.0,"The fabric was nice and comfortable. However, the button holes were made too small so you would really have to push to get the buttons in. I was afraid to rip the item so I did not forcefully insert the buttons. The waist was also quite loose and did not give a nice appeal even with the string that ties around the waist."
3.0,The bottom was honestly kind of small. It‚Äôs low rise but the colors were cute. My least favorite bikini on my trip though out of all 3
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:98a0ee6c2f6577eb9c034f5603ad64a]] This is a handsome looking bracelet that fits well, but has no magnetic properties whatsoever."
3.0,I had to order up a size. Runs a little small. It did not arrive with a belt.
3.0,Otherwise its a nice slipper w/an excellent indor out door sole...I returned my regular. 9.5 for a 10...
3.0,Very thin material. Skin tight!
3.0,Bee was to large for a bracelet!
3.0,Beautiful color but I ordered a large hoping for a generous fit on my medium hand.  I could barely get them on.  But they are nice enough enough that I‚Äôm going to return these and order the XXLarge.  Here‚Äôs hoping‚Ä¶.
3.0,"They're much more rigid than I expected, and a bit difficult to slip on.  Great support for a slipper, but not ""evening comfy"" easy on-off slippers.  Perhaps better for smaller feet (I'm an 11-EEEE)."
3.0,"These are thick ones and would work great for winter but their sizing is so small that it never worked for my kid. I returned it without using so except for sizing, cannot comment on durability."
3.0,It sits funny at hips like it's puckered. Other than that it's cute!
3.0,It is a beautiful bracelet but too difficult to unclassified. It takes two thumbs which is a problem when it's on your wrist.
3.0,Was super cute and seemed like it would have been very comfortable for my daughter. My daughter wears a 3T so I purchased the 2-3yr size and it was enormous. The dress was almost to the floor. I would have loved to keep it if it would have fit but it would take years for her to grow into it.
3.0,"Didn‚Äôt fit, looked fake. ( I know it is fake, but looks it)"
3.0,It's a good temporary fix. Nothing like the ones sold in base but good.
3.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again. I gave it away actually. The ‚Äúadjustable‚Äù straps were just for looks. They don‚Äôt work. The sweater itself has no give in the material and for a man with wide shoulders, that can be a problem. Definitely not as cool as it looks in the picture."
3.0,"I like the shirt, but it's a little tight in the bustling. Fits great everywhere else. Get a size larger if you have a full bustline"
3.0,Cute but parts of it were made of plastic.  I still like it though.
3.0,Broke in like two seconds
3.0,It was not terry cloth like I had in the search criteria.  I assumed it was and went with the more expensive figuring it would have better quality.  I was wrong.  This wrap is not for me.
3.0,"I was really excited about this item, and the necklace is fine (great for the price)...but the earrings were broken, well I should say not properly made. The &#34;silver: was just not molded right and had holes and bubbles in it. I will end up using the necklace and throwing the earrings out"
3.0,"The sleeve were just too short for my daughter so I returned it but nothing wrong with the product.  Very nice color, true pink and navy blue."
3.0,"I typically wear a large but I ordered an XL after reading reviews this runs small; I'm glad I did. The material is stretchy but clings to your skin in a way that may accentuate ""problem areas"". The shirt is long enough that it can be tucked in. My biggest qualm is that the neckline isn't as low cut as the picture details."
3.0,"I love polka dots and the color red, so I saw this I ordered immediately, but, sadly, and I ordered a L, I hate the fabric and even though it‚Äôs adjustable, it‚Äôs too tight for my chest."
3.0,EDIT: the links always come loose and have on each bracelet. Not well put together. You‚Äôd think with so many links it would be more durable but the links are not welded.  Would not buy again.  Watching television and noticed a link was in my lap<br /><br />Like the style not many people have this style bracelet! Complaints about the clasp are fair as one of the two arrived with the clasp broken but I did repair!  Would definitely recommend and am buying a third and maybe a fourth time!
3.0,I had on work watch just returned
3.0,Not the color expected.
3.0,Very thin feather boas. Not fluffy at all. But worked well for costume.
3.0,It fits correctly and looks good. Doesn‚Äôt feel as comfortable as the original band though. Takes a little getting used to.
3.0,"Top is well-made, just too small to close.  Was tighter than expected.  The gloves were odd; palms were large and fingers were too long and too narrow.  Will have to buy gloves from somewhere else to complete outfit.  Hat is supurb; no issues.  Will get the job done for Halloween, but barely.  Cute if you size up and buy gloves from elsewhere.  Still not a bad deal for price."
3.0,When I received them 2-3 of them did not open properly. Looks as though they will break easily
3.0,I purchased these tights to wear after spider vein treatment.  I also purchased a pair of thigh highs to wear at night.  The panty hose ripped in the crotch during the 3rd wearing.  Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.  I am 5'7 and a size 6 pant and had ordered a size medium.
3.0,"I was looking for a ring to use as a placeholder for my engagement ring that is broken right now. I was hopeful this would work, as it looks similar to what my original ring does. What I got, though, is a bit disappointing. The ring does look rather fake, even from a distance. Two of my stones arrived already loose and have a tendency to ""rattle"" in the setting. A third stone is offset and sits higher than the rest. As a result, it snags repeatedly on my clothes and in my hair. Although this did serve its purpose as a placeholder, I wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,I wish the box toe didn't hurt. I really like these boots!
3.0,There is nothing on the back so that's kind of weird
3.0,This band is difficult to adjust and challenging for me too clasp.
3.0,Too small  I order size large and don't feet me
3.0,I got this swim suit in a large. The boob area is a little to big and the torso is a little loose. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 150 lbs with a small bust I ordered a medium in a swimsuit the same style and it was tight on my but the Breast fit perfect so I thought going up would work. Not so muchü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3.0,"Beautiful print.  The kimono was way too small for my body.  I was disappointed.  The fabric is thin, which could be good for summer.  I really wanted this to work out, but it doesn't.  I hope that it will fit my sister"
3.0,"The material is okay. You get what you paid for. I don‚Äôt hate it, but would try a different vendor next time."
3.0,"If you're looking for a simple, no frills piece, then this is for you. Some of the eyes had rubbed off a bit and the silver plastic beads, look like plastic beads."
3.0,It's OK. Not the best quality but fair for the price
3.0,Great package for the price! But very thin and cheap material.
3.0,too shiny
3.0,"Nice, but bulky and heavy."
3.0,"Pretty, but not good quality!"
3.0,Blouse came in timely fashion but was somewhat bigger than expected.
3.0,Definitely looks cheap and took forever to receive. Only wore it once as it looks really cheap.
3.0,This works alright- but a little tighter than expected
3.0,Not very appealing as I wanted it to be. Too many pleated wrinkles near the elastic waist. It does not feel sexy
3.0,Tie straps are too thick on these. If they make them smaller these would be the perfect wave cap. I love the look and feel of them.
3.0,The Heart Itself was Beautiful . Dissappointed in the Chain that Came with it.<br />Waited Way Too Long for This Product to be Delivered . Wanted a s Gift for<br />Christams Didn't Receive till Beginning of February. A beautiful Silver Chain<br />Would have looked more elegant with the pendant heart. Even if it was Vintage.<br />The Chain looked USED. Looking for a Better Chain to go with It.
3.0,A large was a perfect size for me length wise but the elastic was way too tight and I am 5&#34; and weigh 130 and the wine color was more of a bright red....
3.0,These socks are really cute and warm. They have a weird seam though so you have to fold the top of the sock down.
3.0,"I bought this in size 3 for my 2-year old grandson figuring it would be a little big like other outfits I had bought him. The shorts fit fine, I couldn't even get the shirt over his head. Most size 3 clothing is somewhat big on him but the shirt in this set was way too small."
3.0,"I love the shirt, it however runs small<br /> I ordered a large and it fits like a medium."
3.0,Son muy peque√±os y no le qued√≥ bueno a mi hija
3.0,Received today. Very pretty but disappointed in the size of wings.
3.0,They definitely stick to the floor.  The only thing I don't like is the way it feels on the bottom of my feet.
3.0,"Showed up wrinkled, flimsy material. I bought it for my 10 yo's crazy hat day and had to line it with a lot of stuffing to make it fit-which I'm not deducting points for because it didn't say it was for kids-but I do believe the extra lining helped it stay upright. It was cheap, got here in time, can't expect much for the price!"
3.0,Fits very boxy. The print makes the shirt a little stiff.
3.0,"Good idea. I purchased this as a gift for a friend at work. She is trendy, loves jewelry, but wears a not so cute  lanyard with her badge. When I received it, I was as disappointed in the quality. It was very light weight and the beads appear to be plastic."
3.0,Looks absurd......but great for a solid Space Pants outfit really small
3.0,Fits okay.
3.0,Pretty but broke easily so a bit disappointing.
3.0,Had some difficulty getting them attached to my prescription glasses. Noticeable reduction in night glare
3.0,it is not functional for singing.
3.0,"Fit is VERY small!! As in, it is likely an extra small in size, tho it was sold as larger.  Nice fabric tho.  But I have to give these to my daughter"
3.0,Looks ok!
3.0,I like the look but not the clasp.
3.0,I loved the style but the shirt is sized small and is not available in XL
3.0,it is ok.
3.0,"Cute and worth the price, as it was cheap. So don't expect too much. I will wear it out but most people probably wouldn't as you can see through material. Great rocking style around the house. Communication from seller: next to none. But product arrived only one day later than estimated. Would not purchase again though. Better invest more in better quality sweatpants."
3.0,"The seam is located in a weird place and it drives me nuts. Tighter than expected, but still like. It's the exact material that I've been seeking. Plan to buy more with differently placed seams.  They fit fairly well and they are made well."
3.0,"The fabric quality is really nice, the sizing is just all wrong. I normally wear a 1x but ordered a 2x to be on the safe side, it did not fit at all."
3.0,"Purchased the Black#4. Sleeves are pretty, but the fabric on the body of the dress is like that used to make wife-beater t-shirts. It's ribbed, not at all fitting for the elegant sleeves, and quite frankly, poor quality fabric. I purchased this because a friend bought the Black, which was beautiful, nice fabric, and quite elegant. This is not at all the case for the Black#4. Unfortunately, have to return this dress."
3.0,"Not bad. Not mad for the price. came stained/bleached spots but i dont have an issue. they will be for gardening. if you are using it for something where stains will be a problem, i would suggest checking them before wearing them."
3.0,"These wings are beautiful! I got many compliments while wearing them.<br />The only thing I really disliked about them and modified, was the elastic choker was a white jewel printed fabric that contrasted poorly with the esthetic of the blue wings, black antenna headband and black mask. I covered the elastic with a dark fabric and made long ribbons to tie it on instead."
3.0,"Fits true to size, nice quality for price, but is much brighter/lighter red than pictured. The fringe is not red on both sides, as you can see ‚Äî which makes it look cheap imo. This was a specific piece for an outfit, I‚Äôm sad it didn‚Äôt work out. Will return."
3.0,"6 pairs came in the box but I had already put a pair on straight out the box. Lol. One thing I can say is that I like the feel/look of them right out the box. The front of the earrings have some sort of apoxy covering or something so it feels smooth and rounded off. The ONLY grievance I have is that 1 of the pair looks cloudy on BOTH earrings. Not a major deal breaker, but still kind of a bummer."
3.0,One of the lights did not work/ the battery was defective. Had to order a replacement.
3.0,"The material of this dress was nice. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and it hit a little below mid thigh, but keep in mind the cut outs on the bottom. The waist fit well since I sized up, but the shoulders and chest were not good. The shoulders were narrow and the chest was tight on me even after sizing up. I do have a larger chest (34HH) but I had hoped sizing up would have helped that.<br /><br />This would be a nice dress for a wedding, semi formal, holiday party, etc., but it‚Äôs not ideal for people with larger shoulders and/or chest."
3.0,"Nice bag, but the liner is impossibly small. It only holds about half of what the bag has the potential for. The cell phone pocket is only good if you're still using a flip phone!"
3.0,"I got these shoes and the order was going to take a month to get to me. But I actually received it a couple of weeks after I ordered which was a nice surprise! However, the shoe is more than a size too big! It looks nice but for now, my son can't wear them..."
3.0,"I got this dress to wear at my baby shower when I was 7 months pregnant. I got the small and it fit really well, but was a bit tight around the bust. Also, the opening on the sides comes up to about mid-thigh, and there are large openings in the armpit area. I will probably eventually sew those up to be a bit more flattering. It was really light and airy for my summer baby shower."
3.0,Very nice but needs a better change.  Be prepared to buy or put on another chain.
3.0,I am 5'3 and 145lbs. I typically wear a medium. I wanted the dress to fit a tad loose a d have extra length so I ordered a large. It fits more like a small/medium. It fits  well just want it longer. I feel like any shorter and my lady bits would be exposed.
3.0,"As beautiful as these are, they did not last very long before they started to corrode (about 2-4 weeks depending on how often you wear them). Which really sucks because they were so cute! I wished they last longer though"
3.0,"Design is not exact, sleeves are shorter then pictured"
3.0,These leggings are very small and become slightly see through. Not bad for the price you pay
3.0,This was a good item but I could not find our how to size my pictures correctly
3.0,"This is a good material that is durable and comfortable; however, it is more for a toddler than it is for a youth. My 3-year-old, who has a small head fits into this well, and my 7-year-old cannot."
3.0,It dosen't seem to have an accurate  Compass.
3.0,Color was very off
3.0,I‚Äôd recommend for those with a smaller chest. I loved the style and color pattern but I really struggled to fit my chest in this top. it‚Äôs flowy so the next size up would be too big everywhere else.
3.0,cute from far away but obviously cheaply made
3.0,Most of them broke after wearing once or twice. Still very cute though!
3.0,"The back of these earrings are really long, especially for a 7 year old."
3.0,Would have preferred a slightly longer chain. It's okay for ten-year-olds but my teenage granddaughter is the one who wanted this and it is a bit short.
3.0,These slippers are like wearing two left shoes. They look like 2 left shoes and fit like two left shoes.
3.0,"The fit is nice, but it is a noisy skirt when moving around, especially if you are wearing pantyhose underneath. The skirt needs to have a satin liner sewed in! Plan on getting a slip to prevent this, but good luck since it‚Äôs a midi skirt."
3.0,Too much stretch !and white padded inserts creates a uniboob
3.0,nice but not as pretty as i thought it was going to be
3.0,"Cute pajamas, but I would recommend sizing up at least one size, if not two. Our son fits 2T for most clothes (32 lbs, 3 feet tall) and so I purchased 3T thinking they'd be a little big. After one wash they barely fit him, so I think we would have been better off with 4T. He still loves them because they are PJ Masks."
3.0,Super cute. My daughter loves wearing this to dance. But it did come with a yellow stain on the shoulder.
3.0,One of the earrings was broken upon arrival. I just broke the other so they could match. They were really too long.
3.0,The sole is hard. It's very uncomfortable. The play and walk time without the wheels is about 20 minutes. The wheels should be wider for a better glide. Always wear your helmet ! And maybe a butt cushion (lol)
3.0,Lovely shirt.<br />Unfortunately I cannot wear a small.
3.0,"Okay fit, can't beat the price considering that 3 come in a package. Material clings if wearing with stockings."
3.0,It hasn‚Äôt been a year and the inside lining is tearing in multiple places. I‚Äôve been using it less because of covid as well. Otherwise it worked well.
3.0,It's not a choker- it's cute though- too loose without a way to adjust tightness
3.0,"No matter what you do you‚Äôll never be able to secure the watch so that it doesn‚Äôt move. I figured the loop provided leverage to create a fitted wear but it‚Äôs impossible. Good luck, I‚Äôve had my watch fall off after doing vigorous exercises"
3.0,"This bra is extremely comfortable, after using it for a while I cannot go back to wired ones. However it has one problem (as other people also mentioned): after each machine wash its pads get completely misplaced and folded and it is not easy to restore the form (as pads are not removable). I did try machine's 'hand wash' mode - same result. The only way seems to avoid it to really hand wash it, which I am not going to do. So, after few months, I am really getting tired of it and looking for alternatives at other brands: same concept but no hassle with pads after wash."
3.0,"I ordered the one with pink and black, but I got orange instead of the pink. Nice colors overall."
3.0,"This dress seems to run big on me. I usually wear 8-10 and I purchased a Medium and it fits like a big box on me. With the belt, it‚Äôs better but still too baggy."
3.0,I am a pretty big girl. I ordered the 3xl and they don‚Äôt fit as good as I‚Äôd like.
3.0,"I ordered according to the size chart, and it's WAY off. XL was huge, Large was still huge. Guess I'll try a medium and hope I don't have to return a third set.<br />I have a 36&#34; waist and a 42 bust size, so according to the chart even an XXL should have been small on me. Don't really know what they were thinking when they made the chart. Quite the hassle.<br />Nice quality and cute though."
3.0,The chest area is still is a bit small don't get this if you are above a C cup since it will sit awkwardly.
3.0,I ordered a large and it was huge.  I am between a medium and a large. This shirt was VERY long in the arms and length. The other large shirts I purchased fit very well.
3.0,"It's going to serve its purpose for a costume, but the quality is not what I expected. It is more thin than the picture shows and not as solidly gold as displayed. Also the sleeves are 3/4 length."
3.0,"The band itself is great. However, the accompanying new screws are too thin and don't grab into the watch body. I made it work by putting it all together and sealing the screws in place with a drop of glue. So far so good."
3.0,After one wear the bow broke apart. The shoe itself is great but the bow was poorly sewn on.
3.0,"The words look glittery/shiny, but they aren't"
3.0,The picture is deceiving i thought it like vest over sweater doesnt look like the picture
3.0,It came open and one of the shinguards is scratched
3.0,"Love the brea glasses I already had. These arrived damaged, big scrape on one of the arms. So bad my hair got caught on it when I tried them on...not a good thing.  Had to send them back."
3.0,"These a very warm, but they fit too short for my taste."
3.0,"The first day I wore these goggles, they fogged up after about 15 minutes of wearing them."
3.0,It runs small but it is vey beautiful
3.0,"I took a chance on it cause the picture was so cute, still kind of cute I guess but not like the picture. The flowers are the same but the main color is more green than tan. Kind of makes it look dirty. Also the size is obviously bigger than a normal 2t, probably would fit as 3 or maybe even 4t."
3.0,bows fell off not even 5 minutes after wearing. Nice otherwise. Probably can just sew the bows on to make sure they don't fall off. Wish I would have known before we used it for a pageant.
3.0,the bust is really large... however nice flow.. nice fabric.. maybe buy a size smaller than you think
3.0,"Way to big for my ear, kept falling out."
3.0,Great looking watch but the band is just too small for my wrist-but I‚Äôm a pretty big guy
3.0,I love it and it‚Äôs beautiful ... the only reason I‚Äôm giving it a 3 star is because I‚Äôve had to buy it multiple times due to the string wearing out ... the string broke and fell out of my neck
3.0,"I would try out some similar styles in store before purchasing. I normally wear Jackie O style sunglasses and these did not go well with my face structure. Also, they had a very dark tint to them which I did not prefer."
3.0,I thought they'd be bigger. Good quality though
3.0,It works likes it says but get a size smaller the recommeded.  Mine is too large!  Can‚Äôt really wear it.
3.0,Nice shirt. Sizing a bit small.
3.0,Beautiful dress! but smells really really bad!
3.0,"I‚Äôm a little disappointed. These socks were a Father‚Äôs Day gift and when they arrived we saw that they were thick, plush winter socks and not suitable for June in South Carolina.  I thought they were men‚Äôs dress socks thickness but they are winter sweatshirt thickness."
3.0,"This is an ""ok"" watchband. The colors are muted, more so than in the pictures and it's a bit difficult to make out the figures without really staring at it.  That said, if you want an understated band this might work for you.  I purchased a large and the band is just a bit short even fitting it to my wrist.  It's not very flexible, so when the black end tab (that holds the band down) slides off (which happens often) the band end gets stuck on my shirts/jackets.. Probably wouldn't buy this style of watchband again, but for 6 weeks around the holidays I can make do."
3.0,"I wanted these to be my new ‚Äúwork shoes‚Äù. I tried on the right foot, in a shoe store and liked them. I decided to buy these later on Amazon. I‚Äôm not sure why, but after receiving my pair, and trying them on again, I noticed that the design of the shoes won‚Äôt work for everyone‚Äôs feet... the sides of the shoe opening sat right under my ankle bones and dug into them. Other than that, they are true to size, and they have comfortable padded soles. I really wish they had worked for me, but I guess the bone structure of my foot just didn‚Äôt work with this design..."
3.0,Cute and pretty good quality however one of them came with the back severely bent and I had to use pliers to straighten. Didn‚Äôt straighten all the way and worried if I fiddle with it too much it will break. Of course it‚Äôs the one my daughter likes the best‚Ä¶
3.0,"The socks that I had ordered originally were great. They really helped the arthritis in my feet. They were so good I ordered the 3-pack again. But this time I received some unknown brand of regular thin compression socks (black; they didn't even look like the ones I had ordered before and sure didn't look like the picture, which the original ones did). I was going to return them but it seemed more trouble than it was worth (I would have to repackage, rebox, relabel and drive 30 miles to the UPS to drop off the package. Wasn't worth the $20 or so more dollars I would spend in time, effort and gasoline to get my money back. I gave the socks to my 78 year old father in law who likes these kind of sock. This is the first time Amazon has messed up an order and I was a bit surprised. I would like to order more of the same socks but now I am leary of ordering anything from Amazon. What if it was something expensive? Like I said...disappointing."
3.0,These sunglasses are not red. They are fuchsia (pink)
3.0,Not a fan of the material very very thin... guess I shouldn‚Äôt have expected much.
3.0,The body fits as expected but the hood is to large to hold itself up and colapses over my eyes
3.0,"So all in all the costume was pretty good. I only have 2 complaints.. #1 the sellers says true to size, not really i should have fit pretty good in a (ahh don't tell) lol a 2x. I even measured! And followed the size chart.(not Amazon's either) anyhow it was a little big. No big d! #2 the upsetting thing about my costume is the snag at the bottom of the skirt part and a small hole at the top of the dress by the bow kind of below the bow i have a pic i can include. It was not anything i couldnt handle. Outside of those things . I am ok with my purchase thank you for getting the dress to me quickly.  It was every thing that the description said 1 other thing the costume comes with a pair of long red gloves. I would have love to wear with it unfortunately I don't have 2 left hands. Lol."
3.0,I received this coat as a gift because it was on my Amazon wishlist. The coat itself is beautiful and very well made unfortunately it is two sizes too small for me. It took over a month to arrive but I need to exchange for a larger size. How do I exchange? Very much appreciated.
3.0,I would give a five star if the draw string hole is at the right place. The material is thin but doesn‚Äôt see through.
3.0,"Nice sweater, but it has a hole in it‚Ä¶ so that sucks."
3.0,Very lightweight. As I said on my other shirt they don‚Äôt feel clean. I washed them before I tried them on. They also can‚Äôt go into the dryer.
3.0,"It's fine for wearing and isn't see through, but doesn't pass the fitness test. Constantly pulls down and gives a crotch pootch while running. I thought having the flare instead of skinny-to-the-ankle would prevent that but no such luck."
3.0,"Super cute swimsuit,  but if you have anything less than a B-cup this won't fit.  It has the hard molded bra-like cups that don't have removable inserts.<br />I'm barely an A-cup so there's no way this would fit.  I was pretty bummed.  I was really excited to wear this!"
3.0,Fit fine...did not like color in person
3.0,"The headband is quite flimsy. Also, there is a big bulky black heart in the middle of the headband between the horns. It looks very odd."
3.0,The earrings are too heavy for my ears. They are pretty but the gold is very bright like 18k.<br />I will use them for a gift exchange with friends.
3.0,One pair good. The other is too fake looking.
3.0,Elements are really small.  Really expected  3 times the size they are.
3.0,"Love the look, comfort, and size BUT I had to have my mother-in-law reinforce the crotch area ahead of me wearing them due to previous reviews of the seems ripping. Even after her doing so they still have a run line in them in that area just not a rip (as of now) I really love them though other than the seem issue."
3.0,It was a little too small for my needs.
3.0,"It‚Äôs not as fitted as the model shows, but more boxy. The shoulder pads seemed to be too far forward making me look like a linebacker. Quality is wonderful. Disappointed with the fit, wouldn‚Äôt recommend"
3.0,Nice light material
3.0,Sized wrong!!!!
3.0,It appears to be made nice & worth the money to me. The only thing is that it is a little to thick for me which makes it feel heavy on my head. It causes me to get headaches. Unfortunately anything that puts to much pressure on my head such as headbands causes me to get headaches. It has a drawstring sewn in that you can use to tighten it up. This also adds to the weight issue for me. If you are not easy to get headaches from pressure around your head then I would definitely recommend it. It is made very nice.
3.0,To long and for the measurements given they got to far up my waist.
3.0,"Cute socks, but so tight on my calves I can't wear them all the way up. I'd say my legs are of normal size."
3.0,I bought this hat for hunting trips since it is fluorescent pink. BUT i also needed a hat that would keep me warm in the harsh winters of Wyoming. This hat is not insulated at all and is most certainly for looks. Do not buy this hat if you are looking for a true Russian trooper hat for warmth.
3.0,"It's works functionally for protection from sun, but is flimsy, so the fit doesn't look as pretty as shown."
3.0,Seems like decent quality but it did not paying on me at all like it did on the model. I'm a 40c and ordered the extra large but it was still cut funny in the bust for my frame hope this helps someone else otherwise a nice shirt
3.0,Sleeve fell apart the first day.
3.0,Bought bag for present. One of the outside pockets with zipper has the zipper on the bottom of the bag instead of the top.  Oops!
3.0,I like the look and feel and the value is good. Issue is the pockets are farther back than normal and tighter/smaller.
3.0,"Truth be told... I was expecting a lined somewhat thicker material dress. I was very disappointed.<br />I have it hanging in the closet, it arrived wrinkled when I received.  The dress makes an autumn  dress with leggings or stockings or sandals but me personally I don‚Äôt like it. it‚Äôs going to make a great gift for someone but I am disappointed.  I won‚Äôt wear it.I‚Äôm won‚Äôt send it back I‚Äôll just give it to somebody, yet for 20 something dollars I expected better quality. I am not  saying don‚Äôt buy the dress, I‚Äôm simply saying the dress is too thin and I personally did not like it that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying"
3.0,"THE straps on the top fall off all the time when I‚Äôm swimming, even with correct adjustments"
3.0,Broke super easy. But pretty. So whatevs.
3.0,Too small and I didn't order this. Never heard of them.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my DIL who loves unique purses. This is a big purse and has lots of room inside. The big bow on the side is adorable. The purse is great, but I can only give it 3 stars because it had a strong chemical-like scent to it. I tried airing it out for over a week before I gave it to her and it still had that chemical scent. That really disappointed me."
3.0,Very pretty shirt but there is no way you are getting it to go off the shoulder unless you are a small and you order an XL.  I am an XL and it fits like a regular shirt.  Fix this seller as the advertised picture looks like an off the shoulder shirt.  It is definitely a regular round next shirt if you get it in your size.  Extremely pretty though.
3.0,"Description photo of this umbrella is deceiving.  I have large hands and this is way bigger than my fingers.  Not as small and portable and suggested in the photo.<br />The interior design is beautiful when opened.<br />Not sturdy enough for huge storms, nor will or last for years,  but for quick trips from car into the store it is perfect."
3.0,"I didn‚Äôt take a picture of this one on, but the overall fit was not as expected. The hip area cut into hips and doesn‚Äôt allow for you to adjust the bodysuit. The bra cups are also very set, so it‚Äôs not helpful for different body types. It‚Äôs super cute, but it feels like it has to be made for your body in order to work."
3.0,Material was kind of rough. Shirt wrinkles easy
3.0,I am a 34&#34; waste and these fit well around the waste but don't hold important parts well. The pouch area is too small for everything to fit so there ends up being a gap against thigh. They do seem to be fairly well made. Can't say how they'll last yet ass I just got them.
3.0,Back is loose so that it slips off sometimes.
3.0,At first I put 5 stars now it's 3 and a half I received my bag on third of December and today is the 22 of December and already it's coming apart that makes me very üò¢ I'll see it back together lm really in to peace signs for 53 years now
3.0,"I had better hopes as the product looked good, but after a short amount of time one of the clasps had already broken. I don‚Äôt even understand how this piece could just fall off like that unless the manufacturing is really cheap. Check the pic and you‚Äôd understand what I mean)"
3.0,Decent quality metal but the lengths were shorter than they were advertised and that I expected them to be.
3.0,Love the frame size and overall style. These have mirrored lens when I thought they would have black lenses so keeping but will attempt to reorder to get black frames and black lenses. My second pair and I do love style not the lens
3.0,"These masks are solidly okay, and since masks that go behind your head are a bit hard to find, that would have been good enough to earn them four stars at least (they are truly unexceptional but perfectly functional), except that two broke on their first or second use, where the mask meets the elastic. It's not devastating: these are inexpensive and the repair is easy enough, but it's also not great."
3.0,There is nothing wrong. It just look like the picture. The leather bands are very loose and kind of floppy
3.0,too hard itside
3.0,"Got these for grocery shopping, I've had them about 3 weeks and one is ripping already (the lid, not the bottom or side that is weight bearing). They also aren't the easies to zip open & closed."
3.0,"Got this in August, wore it all the time, didn't last more than 4 months. Like the bracelet but it didn't like water, so if you get this take it off near water!"
3.0,"The size is definitely for kids but it will fit the head of some adults.<br />The light is pretty good and I like being able to remove it if needed.  They don't really mention it in the description but if you look at the pictures, you'll see some controls on the side of the beanie. These controls are for the Bluetooth earphones that are built into the beanie.<br />The audio quality for these headphones isn't great but they're not complete trash.  I could see these being really useful when you're engaging in outdoor activities. They could help make short work of raking leaves, shoveling snow, hotwiring cars (jk), and just about anything else.  They easily paired up to my phone and were playing music within minutes.<br />The speakers for the headphones can easily shift inside the beanie so you have to make sure they're positioned right over your ears when using them. If not, the audio will be really muddy, no matter how high you crank your volume.<br />It may seem like I'm being less than enthusiastic about this beanie but it does have its uses. Sure, I'd rather be listening to my SONY over the ears headphones or even a pair of JABRA or Samsung earbuds but if I'm going to be doing something where there's a chance of them getting damaged, I'd much rather have something like this music beanie on my head to supply the music.  Have you ever tried to find an earbud that fell out and landed in a pile of leaves?  I'll put up with a slightly lower quality musical experience if it means never worrying about something like that happening again.<br />If you or your kids need a Bluetooth beanie, I suppose this is fair for the price. I'd definitely grab one or even two if a sale comes up."
3.0,material between top and bottom of back area are too far spread for my liking but otherwise it fits well.
3.0,"In order for this hat to sit on my head correctly, it has to be pulled down too far and it almost covers my eyes.  I like the look and feel of it.  It's very pretty and durable.  But, it's made for bigger heads.  I have an average size head and it did not fit me well."
3.0,"Really cute dress, but it was so staticky that I returned it. The fabric just seems to attract it. Nicely made though."
3.0,Very thin material and pills after a few washes.
3.0,Fabric it itchy
3.0,The Jeff & Aimy black military style baseball cap reminds me of the cap popularized by Chairman Mao decades ago. This one is a basic cap with no eyelets and more suitable for the spherical head. That is not the shape of my head and so it will be gifted to a lucky college kid. It is youthful.
3.0,"Good material, but fit was much shorter than expected, making it fit like a sports bra. I still like it, just not exactly like the picture"
3.0,used for jeans and cargo pants
3.0,Would have given it higher but the main middle crystal was detached/broken on arrival.
3.0,Way to short in the back. Nice breeze coming up the back. Very itchy and scratchy. It has a weird point on the hood. Would look better if it was more rounded out. Frill looks like it is just cut with a pair of scissors. No hem is sewn in. It's heavy should be nice and warm in cold weather if it fits you correctly. It's a little to tight on shoulders. Beautiful coloring. It is ok. But way to expensive for the quality. Bought this for my kid she stands 5'7.
3.0,"The top fit perfect, but the bottom is not for the curvy. It covered necessary areas, but was a slight small fit nonetheless."
3.0,Pretty dress. Runs way too small. Fabric is not very stretchy.
3.0,"So far, so good!  I need to use it for awhile before I can<br />evaluate it."
3.0,"Top is perfect, pants were a bit short. Elastic in pants twisted on the first wear. But they‚Äôre cute!"
3.0,Too thin 2 shape. This shoild just be caalled a slip. Stretches out way too easily even hand washing etc...
3.0,Casual dress for summer. Not the best quality but it is ok.
3.0,it was great but nowcant wear it cuase it shrunk! when washed one time never put my tops in the dryer!it was hung up to dry.
3.0,"Well, I've had progressively worse foot pain for over 15 years and I've bought many different inserts over the years. I finally broke down and went to a foot doctor who gave me some orthopedic inserts and those are making a world of difference. These inserts aren't stiff or sturdy enough and don't conform to your feet like proper orthopedic inserts from a foot doctor. I have a rare high arch type, heel spurs,  and end stage arthritis throughout my feet and these inserts just didn't do anything for my condition. I'd advise if you are seriously suffering to see a foot doctor."
3.0,"We returned this because it was listed as a child watch and what arrived was an adult sized watch.  It looks like it would have been a nice watch, but not for a child."
3.0,"The angle on the top is a bit odd, but it‚Äôs still a super cute suit."
3.0,My son is average size for a 2 year old but I'm fairly certain I will be able to wear this costume with it hitting about mid calf. It's huge. slightly disappointing as I did not intend to be JJ for Halloween.
3.0,The shirt was nice and fit fine.  The only reason I gave this 3 stars is strictly due to the high price for this item and then they tack on shipping which really made it expensive.  If I didn't have to have it I would not have ordered it.
3.0,"Arrived were the size of adult socks, not children's socks. I had to wash them in hot water and dry them on high to come even close to being the correct size for my 12 month old."
3.0,Nice shirt but it was to small
3.0,"Seems pretty warm thus far (not hit winter yet).  But, the lining inside is only attached to the outer/exterior in a few places.  Not the end of the world.  Though it seems kind of thick and warm, it still seems like it is of shabby or flimsy make/quality."
3.0,Cute but thin and collar is flimsy‚Ä¶per teen daughter.
3.0,"It's cute but the ear fell off after 1 use, so be prepared to sew it back on."
3.0,"Son loves it... However, I can't figure out how to change the darn thing from military time... So trying to explain military time to my son has been somewhat of a challenge and discouraged him from wearing it. Plus we can't get it to stop beeping randomly and his teacher took it away at school..."
3.0,"I love the feel of the gloves. However, they've started to come apart at the seams between the fingers after only two months."
3.0,"If I would have known that these were not sewn together, I would not have bought them. The bow is tied but comes apart. Ultimately it‚Äôs one long piece of cute fabric... that was super disappointing."
3.0,I‚Äôm a size 14 and it is not flattering
3.0,Very weird smell even after washing
3.0,"Nice shoes, but tread on bottom is poor, so they don't provide a lot of grip on the playground."
3.0,"She loved the costume, but the pants were HUGE! the shirt and jacket were fine.  My daughter is 5‚Äô2 and about 110. We purchased a small. Would have liked an XS option."
3.0,They shrink but they are 100% cotton so that was expected. The peach colored one looked very streaky after it was washed. They are a little on the thin side so if not wearing the proper undergarments you could see through them.
3.0,The dress was a little too straight. I wanted it to fit slimmer at the waist. Sending it back.
3.0,Fit weird in different places. I returned. Product is like leggings attached to large top scarf falla off arms.
3.0,"2 of 3 watches worked upon receipt. Third one, the windup knob fell off. It never worked."
3.0,Love the saying on it!
3.0,"I loved the sandal but they run extremely small, they did fit my daughter so I kept them"
3.0,"I sized up as some reviews recommended and I should have followed the chart.  I'm 5'6, 135 lbs and this suit was too big."
3.0,Too small.... Great look
3.0,I purchased two of these as an after-surgery aid as I did not own many blouses that buttoned in front.  The fabric was much coarser than I expected and the x-large size was tight (despite the fact that I had had double mastectomy.  Overall the blouses looked pretty and were well made.
3.0,I wanted to like these...they are very cute and soft. Unfortunately they were just too wide for my daughter's feet and they wouldn't stay on. The length fit fine. But if your child has wide feet then I'm sure these would work!
3.0,These are Wrangler jeans however they are the thinnest jeans I have purchased ever. Why are all jeans like tissue paper now? The problem with all these thin jeans is they wear/rip out in the stitching in the crotch area from wearing them. After about 10 wears they are worthless.
3.0,"2 of the 3 earrings were the same pair. So I actually only received 2 different styles of earrings, not 3. The ones I really wanted were not included in the pack."
3.0,"Super sparkly but they are so small they backs are constantly falling off. I've already replaced a lost pair with a better set. Also, the stones pop out of the prongs VERY easily. Obviously cheaply made, but did the trick for a little while"
3.0,"As described, Late shipping"
3.0,The color is not the dark navy blue I thought it might be. But I do like the hat
3.0,Not even a full day of wearing and the chains broke on all 4. No I didn't have them too tight or anything I was simply walking. Disappointed üòû
3.0,"Neckline wasn't as expected, so I ended up returning"
3.0,I wanted to love these shoes but they were sooooo tight around the toe. Maybe if I sized up they would have fit better. Overall a cute shoe
3.0,"I have wide shoulders therefore the sizing does not work at all, but it worked awesome for my friend"
3.0,Fit as expected. Really cute and full tutu. Only down side is the top was too thin. You could see through it when my daughter out it on
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but it didn't fit. I think if I would have got two sizes bigger I would have been fine. I bought a size 10 and I'm a medium sized woman, and it didn't fit. Keep that in mind when you buy the dress."
3.0,too heavy for a lady to carry.
3.0,"Since it is white color, it's very easy see through your underwears."
3.0,"Everything about these is awesome, except the bridge piece. It is x-shaped, and either the bottom digs into the bridge of the nose, or the lower mounting point of the X digs into the side of the nose. Tried to adjust this at least a dozen ways. Seriously, except for that, they are the best goggles I have ever tried, but can't use them unless I can figure out how to make them more comfortable."
3.0,"This piece was inexpensive and it shows.  Not a high quality item, but will do for casual wear."
3.0,"The suit is a red velvet corduroy omggggg I didn‚Äôt even know that when I got it!!! The bottom is seamless *major points*. The top is TOO small!! I wish we could mix and match these sizes. I still love it but I am a little squeezed in at the top. Might have to buy the medium set and sell the different tops and bottoms but that‚Äôs kind of ridiculous don‚Äôt you think, zaful?"
3.0,I don't think this is an authentic Speedo swimsuit. It doesn't have the anti wedgie strip like it claims nor does it have any type of Speedo logo on it. It runs small as other reviewers have said.
3.0,"Seem sewn crooked, item returned."
3.0,"I gave this jacket three stars because the sizing is all wrong. As soon as I pulled it out of the bag it looked like a child's jacket. I can close the zipper but it's a close fit (reaches my waist). If you are looking for a loose fit, order AT LEAST two sizes up. I went for the recommendation of one size up, but it was not enough. I am a medium and ordered large. I should have gotten extra large or xx-large. Other than that, the quality is good, although the color is at least two or three shades darker than online, more like emerald green than light turquoise. The orange online  on the sleeves and collar is closer to coral red in person. I would have loved it anyway had it been a tad bigger."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and 90% of the time I buy medium everything from shirts to pants and swimsuits and undies.<br /><br />No free returns on mediums because you'll need to pay for return shipping and handling. Says full return, but I don't trust it. Ended up cutting mine up for scraps and throwing it away. The shippers don't speak English and the return email I recieved took some time to decipher, but they seemed really nice and gave me 2 options.<br /><br />&#34;&#34; ------------ Begin message -------------<br /><br />hi, dear buyer. We are sorry about this. do you want to exchange item? Cause the shipping fee is high(we haven't offer return shipping fee, cause our return address was in US), we would like refund you 20% item price, if you can keep it; if you still don't want to keep it, we will give you return address, after you return please must tell us your return tracking number or shipping receipt, It will as a proof you have return item to us. After this we will full refund you! :) Waiting for your reply. any question please contact with us. Thank you!<br /><br />(Cause time different between China and US, so we may can‚Äôt reply you e-mail in time. But Once we see your e-mail, we will reply to you asap. Thank you for your patience! Have a nice day! ^Q^) &#34;&#34;<br /><br />I'm:<br />5'5&#34;<br />140 +/- lbs. (Depending on the time of month)<br />34C (also depending on the time of month haha)<br /><br />The fabric was lovely and true to the pictures. Has a beautiful shimmer to it. It's pretty thin fabric, but in a nice way... like it would dry fast and you wouldn't be all moist for ages.<br /><br />Straps are nice and thick and for those with chests we know is a plus.<br /><br />The foam inserts are very small so you might want to switch them out for larger ones from one of your dresses or other swimtops to avoid that awkward circle outline on the chestal region.<br /><br />My legs are fairly cushiony but the thigh holes seemed just fine. Not tightness. Had a decent amount of give.<br /><br />I feel like a have a pretty filled out midsection, but the garment was too big around.<br /><br />Length wise however it was way too short. I don't have a particulary long torso so I do want to warn you. You might need really large filled out perky boobs or really really large sagy boobs for this to work. The shape is just different than I'm used to.<br /><br />Loved the suit overall, but sadly it just doesn't work with my body type. I hate to pass up a shimmer suit with such a comfy neck strap. So sad."
3.0,Band is really really bug.
3.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but very cheaply made. But you can‚Äôt beat the price. Ordered it for my niece, so I don‚Äôt know how well it fits but I can tell it won‚Äôt survive a wash. Lots of strings on it and seams coming g undone."
3.0,"I love the graphics on this sweatshirt, but the sweatshirt itself runs VERY SMALL. I ordered an XL and it fit like a medium. Had to send back. Very sad :-("
3.0,"It is a simple and delicate set, but those earrings look too cheap. I bought it for my wedding and was looking for something simple and nice with just a little added spark. I'll still be wearing the necklace but I will have to look for a nicer earrings to pair it with."
3.0,I wear a 6-7/8 and this was too wide for my hats... easy fix if you‚Äôre handy I simply cut a 1/4‚Äù off both side and sanded it smooth... it‚Äôs a bit round for my long oval hats... but not now
3.0,Liked the socks but very tight around the ankles.
3.0,"The dress is exactly what I wanted but when I ordered one the colors were pale looking, not as bright as shown online.  We are doing a special thing for my mom's memorial so me and my sisters are dressing alike using this dress.  My sister in Texas order one and her colors were bright so I gave it a chance and ordered another one.  Glad I did, the colors were perfect.  Now my other sister is having to order multiple times to get the brighter colors.  We will have a lot of dresses to return."
3.0,Seems kind of cheap if you know what I mean. A little confusing to put on due to the way it's made
3.0,Paper thin material. I use it as a night gown.
3.0,I love the sturdiness of them but the insulated panel is ripping on the lid. Does not make it unusable just kind of ugly
3.0,"Runs big, but very comfy"
3.0,"I originally ordered a medium but returned for a small.  Although I know this should fit loosely, to me the small is still very room, so even over a swimsuit it will feel a little big for me. Material gets very wrinkled."
3.0,"Ordered for my Sr. in high school as this was something in his wheelhouse of fashion.. Note: this is a very trendy item- baggier, drop crotch, below waist fit, oversized pockets. I liked the idea of having a casual style pant but, in a khaki color!<br /><br />These are a thicker weight- similar to a heavier sweatshirt‚Ä¶ Only, once opened up- Im unsure why the clothing felt damp or worse.. sticky!!? Whhaa..? I‚Äôm still baffled as to why- I‚Äôm just guessing its pre-treated fabric.. maybe a Scotchgard??<br /><br />Washing: machine wash on cold and line dry.. these do run SHORT (Or, shorter!!) be careful with the shrinkage!!! However, after completely dry I had to use a few dryer sheets to run cycle trying to soften treatment on fabric.. guessing I‚Äôm 80% of the way there! Hopeful next wash does the trick.. just note: treatment used is stiff on the material.<br /><br />Sizing: bc of my sons height, we adequately size for length. For reference: 6‚Äô4‚Äù, 188lb, 33x36, 18yr- in between a man/boy body.. active but, not overly athletic build. Ordered XL- with these having a tie elastic waist they were easy to accommodate a nice fit. Cuffed at the ankle- these fall approx. 2‚Äù too short..!! Mine must wear his high top shoes to compensate for the discrepancy. Take note: if taller then 6ft. this may be an issue..<br /><br />Overall, I find the treated fabric and it‚Äôs nuances along with overall style + fit to be at a high price point at $40- from photograph on website, it‚Äôs a bit hard to see this is a trendier fit and different then what we were wanting. So, be certain it‚Äôs your style prior to investing! Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!"
3.0,really baggy. Im a sz 13 and ordered the XL..has no curves or shape. Pretty much a long sparkly potato sack. Not impressed
3.0,It fit fine when I first got then it shrank and became tight in the neck and sleeves. I cant push up the sleeves its so tight. And it's uncomfortable around my neck. I wear got a medium and I'm 5'7 average weight and other than the size issue I like it.
3.0,For surgery
3.0,Cute earrings but overpriced<br />Wouldn‚Äôt purchase again for this price
3.0,It's definitely thin cheap material and was not nearly what I expected in terms of length.
3.0,Waist fit as expected but the length was extremely long. It was as though I was wearing pants.
3.0,Like the colors but the put the tie up too high that the shirt is almost like a mid-driff shirt.
3.0,Very large in busy area
3.0,"I like the color, but they're too small to fit over my glasses. The grandchildren love them. I wonder if you sent the child's size?"
3.0,As expected and pictued
3.0,Stones fell out after a few hours of wearing. Still like the skull studs themselves.
3.0,"Watch is good looking with good built quality but the strap it is using is very narrow and is very stiff. The strap feeps like that it is about to break, due to it's stiffness, while putting on the watch."
3.0,"A nice looking quartz movement watch. My watch is only 6 months old and already breaking down. The &#34;day of the week&#34; section of the watch no longer works. It is also showing signs of wear, even though this watch is usually babied by me. You get what you pay for with this watch."
3.0,Good selection. Quality was average.
3.0,I feel like this shirt ran a little small. It was a gift and the recipient hasn‚Äôt complained but by my standards it ran small. But super cute!
3.0,"They are ok... too loose, not recommended for sports, but if you want the glasses for driving like I did, they are ok."
3.0,"The belts are nice looking, very good quality and a good value.  I recommend this product."
3.0,Had an odd smell.
3.0,"Got it that day, put it on for work, when I got to work went to a mirror an noticed  2 stones fell of one earring, then look at my others earring an one stone fell out of that one, so I sent it back, I bought these earrings from the same company last year an didn‚Äôt have any problems with them !!"
3.0,Cute but very cheap metal wore one for two days and my nose swelled up..
3.0,Sitting about 5 feet away from a very dainty fire was enough to melt the plastic straps together while I had it on. Up until that I really enjoyed this watch.
3.0,I like this black scarf but it could have been thinner its a bit on heavy! It could be lighter!
3.0,It‚Äôs super light I think if I wear it out in the sun it might be see through. More of a summer skirt. Thought it would be more stiff and less old lady flowy. I suppose if you need it for the office or something more formal it would be ok. It‚Äôs just not worth the price.
3.0,I had bought a blue shirt that was not see through and loved it. Is another color not see through?
3.0,"While I like this dress, it ripped the first time I wore it near the zipper. It also has some stringy things that come out of it, like the material that makes it so stretchy. Not sure I would recommend."
3.0,"Expected more of a dress, less of a swimsuit cover."
3.0,"Item came with the gem already missing. Dissatisfied and returned immediately.<br /><br />edit: March 23, 2017<br />The seller kindly sent me a replacement batch. The first time they sent a replacement, there was again a loose gem. I was dissatisfied. They offered to send another replacement. This time, the gems were intact. I have been wearing one stud to test out the quality, and I can say that I am satisfied so far.<br /><br />One critique that I have though is that the studs should be more &#34;L shaped&#34;. At it's current state, there is a little bend to hold the stud in, but it would be better to have the L shape be more prominent so that it stays in one's nose better (And less of a risk of falling out)."
3.0,"The bow is off to the right, and it's very poor quality material. The suit its self is very cute and my daughter loved it!"
3.0,"We bought this bag as a gift for a family friend. She is in her fifties, and was very happy that she has something little  compared to her current handbags. The bag is beautiful, feels sturdy, and definitely comes with brand name on it. We were very happy with the purchase."
3.0,"Nicely packaged 2 pack of neckties - rolled nicely in a sturdy black cardboard box. The ties in this set, however, are just sort of meh. 1 tie is a hot pink, candy cane striped tie with contrasting glitter. Not exactly my cup of tea but might be fun to use for a Christmas party or what not. Tie #2 is a very faint, lightly hued pink. If the color sets appeal to you then by all means give it a try."
3.0,"cute top, got lots of compliments. Keep in mind this is a Chinese brand so it ran small, I normally wear a large or XL in US sizes and ordered a 2x in this top."
3.0,Fit big didn‚Äôt like it at all on me .!
3.0,"It is cheaply made, but if you hang it up in your bathroom and take a few hot Showers it will un wrinkle."
3.0,Very soft fuzzy slippers. For an XL they barely fit my size 9 foot.
3.0,the  case is broken. Glass is very nice
3.0,"Pretty cheap in quality. If you're using it as a costume prop, it might do the job. Doesn't allow for much fumbling around or handling; it'll fall apart easily."
3.0,"This item is cheaply made, so thank you, but no thanks, I had this back in the 80s and this set is cheaply made so thank you."
3.0,"Very thin material and small fit, but that may partly be as i am at the top end of the size range at US 11 shoe other wise comfortable and cool. one sock arrived with a hole in it and is why i gave it 3 stars for poor quality control. Have not contacted vendor yet to see how they intend to rectify it.  nice colours, pictures are quite accurate."
3.0,"This product shipped pretty fast, a little upset that it‚Äôs not exactly like the picture. The truck and ram symbol is all red color vinyl not like that picture shown when ordering. Fits true to size, still love this shirt."
3.0,"there ok, do not block out 100 percent glare"
3.0,"These are not bad...if they stay put. My issue is that they kept catching in my hair and pulling the cord loose. Also, they wouldn't stay put on one side, so not the best. Works great if you just set and leave, but mine are off and on all day."
3.0,Does NOT come with a stand
3.0,Calidad regular
3.0,Ok- this is cute- but it‚Äôs not a dress. If you bend over at all your butt cheeks are hanging out the bottom- and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4‚Äù. It‚Äôs more like a big hoodie/extra mini dress. I love that it has front pockets and the hood. It really does give you the impression of one of those vintage teddy bears. The material is NOT that soft- so don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be getting the material that they make those extra cozy blankets out of! :) I‚Äôll end up using this as a bumming around with jeans on a cold day to Publix. It‚Äôs not anything special- but it‚Äôs ok for that kind of day.
3.0,"They fit well... they are not ""shoddy""<br />That said... they won't last on any surface<br />The bottom construction is such that the sides of the shoe at the base impact the ground .. there is no rubber like surface there.... only the thin neoprene side.<br />Most of this type of boot have a dedicated sewn on sole... even diving booties have this... or are dipped in a rubbery compound that comes slightly up the side for wear. These will wear out.. if you look closely at the photo you can see how the side rolls down to the base to leave you walking on the sides.<br />This was for use for a costume only... for anything else... I would have returned them... or dipped them in tool handle compound."
3.0,Color not what I expected..
3.0,Purhased in a size S and really like them in the asphalt plaid. Purchased another pair of the Ventura shorts in solid asphalt color in S and they were too small. Returned. Purchased another pair in navy plaid in S and the legs are wide. I will keep and have them altered. The prints are much more subtle than shown in the pictures which is a plus.
3.0,"Too small I like very much I will order another one in large ,I will give this one to my daughter she loves it"
3.0,These were a little bigger than I expected and unfortunatly the lens did scratch sooner than I would have liked. Overall it was a decent product for th price I paid.
3.0,The latch keeps opening. We actually just ended up tying them together.  We‚Äôve tried other brands/types that have worked out better.
3.0,"Love tigger. I love that I now have a watch band with tigger on it. That being said, it is cheaply made and not worth what I paid for it. The tiggers are blurry and I am not satisfied with the product. I will be looking again for a different tigger watch band."
3.0,"I'm disappointed in these socks given the good ratings.  I wear a size 7 to 7.5  M shoe and these are huge on me.  The heel goes way up my ankle and they're loose all over.  Also, they are described as thin. It's fair to say that they're thin compared to a wool hiking sock or a thick athletic sock, but compared to thin socks I own for dress shoes, they're pretty thick. On the continuum of women's sock weights, I'd call these a medium weight. They're marginal in my Chelsea boots, given the extra fabric going up my leg and around my foot.  I'll have to wear them with other shoes.  I hope they shrink."
3.0,"I wear a large but decided to go with extra large based on the photo &amp; some previous customer reviews - I'm glad I did.  The material is thin &amp; not as warm as I expected, but for the price offered, I think it is a decent purchase."
3.0,"Hilarious and cute, fits as expected. But the graphic is threatening to peel off and I‚Äôve only washed it once. I washed inside out and I hanged it to dry.  I didn‚Äôt pay much for it, but I would have paid more for a better graphic!"
3.0,I loved this bag but it ripped to soon. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"These are very small glasses, adolescent or woman sized. Other than that, they seem fine."
3.0,"I guess I should have read the description more carefully because I expected this to come with a chain but it didn‚Äôt. Since this is to be a gift, I will still need to purchase a chain to go with it."
3.0,Was to small u need to go up 3 to 4 sizes more then your size
3.0,"It was okay dress, a bit on longer side in length. Material looked different in pucture but isnt as glaxy as shown in pictures. Its cotton not bad quality though."
3.0,"It didn't work for my needs, the material is silky-like, and rides up, won't stay. Too tight."
3.0,Too big.. Im sure if i went down 3 sizes it would've been as pictured.
3.0,"Feels like it has more polyester than cotton, all other descriptions by the manufacturer appear to be right on, the double cuff buttons, reversible cuffs, spread collar, chest pocket. This shirt is a darker blue that the light blue pictured."
3.0,What I don‚Äôt like about this piece is that is a see through in the upper side of the jumper and somehow a bit bigger for me. Linen is super thin you‚Äôll definitely need a slip underneath.
3.0,Just wish it has a bra lining besides that it's good for swim class.
3.0,"I ordered a large as I am 5'10 and 140 lbs.  The sleeve were long enough but the body part was too big and baggy.  Will probably have to return, otherwise very nice.  The material is thin, yet warm and very soft."
3.0,"These were a bit small and short on my husband, but seemed like a nice quality."
3.0,Omg my feet hurt so bad I had to hurry to take pictures. I was told you size up which I did shoes was still too small and part over my toes hurt the most! It‚Äôs so tight!! Like I know I was fat feet but jeez
3.0,Returned them  Way too big.
3.0,They are super cute. Her toes slip out in the front if she kicks her foot on something.
3.0,Thin material and the fit is weird
3.0,Bought for my 1 in half year old daughter. I had these when I was younger and she loves to dress up. I thought she would end up taking them off but she kept them on all day . Can also be used as just stickers.
3.0,The buckle is larger than most belt ends. It fits through the loops on some of my belts and others it's too large for.
3.0,a cheap piece of rubber but it works.
3.0,Medium wrist almost to small
3.0,"My only complaint is the inside is not satin, which was the whole reason in buying this one. It fits as expected I'm 5'6 and 150lbs I bought the large for a looser fit."
3.0,"Nice looking slippers. However, they seem a bit small - although I always wear a 8-1/2, my toe is pressing up again the front of the shoe. I would advise you to order up a 1/2 size. Wish I had. They are not as comfy as I would like. Maybe they will stretch."
3.0,Cute necklaces. We ordered two sets and one had two of the same necklaces which was very disappointing.
3.0,"It‚Äôs ok, thought it was a sweater but it‚Äôs not"
3.0,"Very pretty. It's just not for me. My breast are different sizes so unpadded or unformed cups often look and feel wonky on me. I wanted this one to fit properly so bad, because  it is so pretty but alas it sits in my drawer as a last resort garment."
3.0,It states that they are long cardigans and the ones I got were not! Not very happy about it either.
3.0,"Contemplating a return.  A bit too big and one pocket is not sewn, a large hole when your Fingers slip in.<br />Nice otherwise, but no smalls"
3.0,I ordered a large even though I am a medium. The tightness is fine but it rides up. I am constantly pulling it down. It needs to be longer for it to be a product worth buying again. Definitely get a size up if you are going to buy it.
3.0,"The watch is attractive and inexpensive. The instructions which came with the watch stated that a qualified watch repairman should size the wristband. This information  should have been listed in the Amazon ad. If it costs more than $5.00 to have this done, I will return the watch."
3.0,Too small and it's my usual size from koi.  The design is very odd.  The construction is unattractive and not what I was expecting. If I had seen it in person I would never have bought it.
3.0,Product fit as expected and was as described. I was expecting a little more compression. I am athletic build 5ft 9in tall weighing about 170.
3.0,Smaller than I usually wear
3.0,"The robe was made of a good quality fabric, the color was beautiful, but it was just too small for a six foot man."
3.0,"I love the dress, but the bust is very small. I ordered a 3x and wear a DD bra; the bust is meant for a C cup, max."
3.0,Good product<br />Fit well<br />Ran a tad small<br />Very thin
3.0,pretty cute but fit a bit larger than expected.
3.0,"Super cute shirt. shorts were a little more on the bigger side, but over all I am happy with this outfit."
3.0,Some of the pins were stuck and broke..but a nice set...
3.0,These break easily in the mail and when trying to work with in crafts.
3.0,"Nice shirt - colors are nice and vibrant. However, it runs small - order a size up."
3.0,"I guess if you're skinny the pockets are ok but if you're heavy, the pockets just bunch up at the hips and look HORRID."
3.0,"Overall the dress is comfortable however, it‚Äôs incredibly big. I ordered an xl because they didn‚Äôt have a lg in the color I wanted. I should have ordered a size smaller and it would have been perfect. If you order this dress order the size smaller than your normal size."
3.0,Just not as good fit or quality as the other freya suits I have purchase. The banded halter in my other suits offers more support
3.0,"Not really impressed for the price i paid, the material an the color. Looked brighter in the pic..<br />Another site had it $5 cheaper n i went with the higher price because the pic looked better.  Could of saved goin to the cheaper company. But still not worth more than $5. Very thin.."
3.0,"Granddaughter loved the pajamas, just a little tight around the shoulders."
3.0,"I didn't pay much, so it's better than what I was expecting. I typically fall between a 2x to a 3x depending on the brand, and this fits. It just fits kind of oddly on my chest. Other than that, it's really nice. The fabric is soft, and it falls nicely, it will definitely be cute when paired with a belt. It's a good summertime dress."
3.0,It's ok but the open spaces at the front and back limit the bag's ability to keep items safely.
3.0,"Terrible material, bland colors, not tummy control at all! Save your money, or splurge and buy the real thing!"
3.0,"Nice color, good fit but not very comfortable for a heel this low( although not as low as I expected...). The price is great but the quality and shoes structure is not."
3.0,"Locs Matte Black Frame w/ Very Dark Lenses...‚Ä¶.NOT. The glasses are awesome looking, they fit great, very cool looking however the lenses are NOT very dark at all. I ordered these glasses because they looked great and were to have very dark lenses and they are not dark at all. I wasted my money because I like dark lenses and these glasses did not deliver."
3.0,Fit looks
3.0,The necklace is cute but the size of the pearls in the earrings are so big that the horse shoe is not noticeable and cause them to look funny
3.0,This dress is very pretty and I have gotten a lot of compliments but it is not the most comfortable.  The waist band was a little scratchy to me.  Great dress for the price though.
3.0,Product functions as it should. But I keep getting emails to leave a review (which I don‚Äôt really appreciate) so here it is.
3.0,The fabric isn't soft and not very comfortable to wear.
3.0,"Nice charm, horrible chain"
3.0,"Very cute, but cheaply made and therefore flimsy. Bends very easily."
3.0,"I received this as a gift and absolutely LOVED it. It does run a tad small, but I was prepared when I put it on my wishlist and put in for a size larger. The tshirt quality is very nice. Not cheap and thin, I was actually amazed at how nice it was. The lettering and saying , I felt as a teacher, were perfect for my job.<br />I washed it 1 time in cold.  Dried it on medium and when I just now removed it from the dryer the letters are all peeling off. I am actually a lot more sad about this than I would expect to be over a tshirt. I just really loved this shirt. The fabric, the fit, the look. I had planned on buying more in a variety of colors, now I am hesitant.<br />*order replacement and item has stretched out neckline and letters don't seem securely applied to shirt."
3.0,perfect inexspensive gift for an outsider like a short term friend looks good just wish it would have came in a box and not just plastic
3.0,does not fit as I expected.
3.0,My girls love these shoes and they are really cute just like the picture but the bottoms are really slippery. And they run somewhat small I should have went a whole size bigger
3.0,Very pretty but it broke at the top as soon as I got it üòë
3.0,All masks are not the same size. Also they are definitely not very stretchy. They are a snug fit which I didn‚Äôt like. They are stitched at edge which was ok but not hemmed. Material very thin. Material is soft. Designs looked good.
3.0,"Does NOT fit like 3x!!! Very upset about this. I kept it and will wear bc it too much to ship back. And also I wear under a sheer kamino. It is very tight!!  Will not buy again, very disappointed!!!!"
3.0,The material is almost too thick to bend around the clasp.  The tool is handy for using on the band that you will eventually purchase after this one.
3.0,"To start, the front part of the bra has these black triangular pieces to cover the nips that are sewn in. I'm going to cut them out bc they don't look right in the bra. It makes the bra look horrible. And for the back, the crossed straps rub against me in to of my shoulder blades (bra straps and bands are usually below the blades for a well fitted bra. I like that it's stretchy and super adjustable. I more just don't like the straps rubbing and twisting around on my shoulder blades. I'm a 42D fyi"
3.0,I am happy I got it so quickly because I needed something very last minute but the bodice is very short. I will have to remove the breast pads to make it workable. The slit is also not as long as the photo. It barely reaches my knee. That is a major impact on the appeal. There is also A LOT of fabric on the skirt. Sometimes less is more. It is a pretty dress. It just needs to be refined- like the one in listing.
3.0,"I love the bracelet, and I love the charm. Part of the silver has worn away to show the brass underneath. It's definitely not solid stainless. It's very nice, and I love the clasp and the construction. It's slightly rough where the silver has been chipped. Anyway, I wear it often. It's comfortable and inexpensive. If you need it to be sterling or stainless steel, be aware, it's electroplated and that the plating may flake off in places where the chain rubs."
3.0,"Despite these being unisex, I found these to be a bit too small for my female head."
3.0,For was good but lace had pulls in it upon arrival and color is not like pictured. The top lace is light pink and the under lining is a darker pink so its 2 different colors
3.0,"Bought this for my gender reveal party- I am 5‚Äô3 and 130 lbs and ordered a medium. When this dress arrived and I took it out of the package it looked HUGE!! I didn‚Äôt think it would fit at all. I showed it to my husband and his friend and they said it looked like it would fit them. Anyways‚Äî I went ahead and tried it on and much to my surprise it fit decently! A little loose on the arm holes and not as snug as I‚Äôd have liked it, but the length was fine, and a day before the party I wasn‚Äôt going to be too picky as long as my dress wasn‚Äôt falling off. Long story short, I would think you could get away with ordering a size smaller than you think, but even if the dress looks too big go ahead and try it on!!"
3.0,These were made to fit more like a young teen
3.0,A tad small but still cute and fit mostly.
3.0,"I like it, but it did not look like the picture at all. the waist does not cut in like the picture. it is wider at the waist area"
3.0,"This is really cute, you just have to be careful because the front clasp will come undone. Wore this out for about 5 hours and my friends caught it twice undone in the front. It has a lobster clasp in the back to adjust length."
3.0,The pants pattern is really nice but the waist band is super tight. If you are shapely these pants may not be for you.
3.0,"The dress is blue and white only, no black as the image portrays. I sized up per recommendations and it still is a weird fit. The fabric is horrible and would be very hot to wear. The cute design is the only thing it has going for it, wish the print was as advertised though."
3.0,Es muy bonita pero es demaciado peque√±a ni para un bebe
3.0,"These pants are decently comfy and pretty flattering. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7.5‚Äù and weight 140 and ordered the M. The tag says 6/8. I‚Äôm normally an 8 and would say the M is closer to a size 6. They fit, just a little tight at the waist, but still acceptably comfortable for me. I‚Äôve read that they run long, but they def weren‚Äôt too long and I would have liked them to be an inch longer.<br />I‚Äôve only worn them once. The material seems like it may pill. We will see.<br />Not bad for $12."
3.0,"These are great except they stick out on my face a lot, almost like those virtual 3D glasses"
3.0,"TL;DR: They're not bluffing, don't wear it in the shower. Although, it is leather so you should be able to.<br /><br />Honestly I love the design and clasp. Wanted this to work so badly for my St. Jude medallion that I rarely remove. This necklace lasted almost 2 months before it just pulled apart one morning while I was taking a shower. I was just repositioning the medallion to my front and pulled down a little to take the slack out and the necklace gave out. Breaking in the middle.<br /><br />I know the vendor answered a question saying ""No, it's genuine leather, can't be worn in the shower."" I have had numerous leather necklaces and bracelets over the years and worn them in the shower, pool, etc. regularly with no issues. One that was dyed blue did become discolored but the bracelet maintained structural integrity.<br /><br />Later that day I ordered a simple leather necklace, not braided just a simple leather cord. I began wearing it in Jan. 2019, in the shower, lake, pool, just were ever I went and it has held up wonderfully.<br /><br />My research on the topic is that yes, leather can be worn in the shower with certain caveats or understandings. In general it can cause the leather to fade or discolor, cause it to mold and mildew as well as have a bad smell. The fading and discoloring aren't a concern in my situation, mold and odors haven't been an issue.<br /><br />So, why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2? The vendor did say not to do what I did so I was warned. However, the warning flies in the face of all information I'm aware of about wearing leather in water. That shouldn't cause it to literally break. And, other customers had theirs break with no indication they were worn in the shower, pool, etc. So, water could perhaps speed up the deterioration of the product but isn't the only reason it would break. So, if you have your heart set on this specific necklace I would recommend keeping a spare on hand for the apparently inevitable breakage."
3.0,"Great looking, poor quality lock buckle."
3.0,Doesn't hold up in the washing looses it's hape and the fabric goes like a rag.
3.0,This is labeled as a dress but it‚Äôs quite short for my 4yr old... definitely have to wear leggings with it. We prefer modesty.
3.0,I ordered this for my husband and he loves it.  But now the watch band's top layer - where the color is - is separating from the bottom part.  Its hard to tell him the watch he enjoys band is going bad as he is not healthy.  I have ordered a new band from Fossil but don't have a lot of hope it will be any better.  If the watch was still available on amazon I would have just ordered him a new one for the price of the watchband and a new battery.  Will keep that in mind.
3.0,"I like the style, but too big."
3.0,"Nice looking earrings, but I'm not sure of the quality of the metal.  It gave me ear infections so I had to stop wearing them.  They also tarnished quickly."
3.0,"Great quality, too small."
3.0,"This shirt is very cute, but I have very long arms and torso and got a small so it did not fit but great product overall for someone who is normal sized"
3.0,Fits way to small!!
3.0,I ordered blue but purple came in.
3.0,"My girls are 34G and were totally busting out of this outfit. It was also a very hard material, and not comfortable."
3.0,"love the pattern, but my son wears a 6.5 toddler sized shoe and these are barely big enough."
3.0,Meh... I am 5'2&#34; not a long torso by any means and I feel as though this is two inches too short.  It was a little big around the top and bottom circumference also.  It washed well and is comfortable but a little off with the overall sizing.
3.0,No me gusta el tipo de tela es muy aguada y se me baja el pantal√≥n aparte que lo compre un poco grande
3.0,The little caps on the end fell off the moment I took them out the package. üòí
3.0,The colors are stunning. I‚Äôm 25 weeks and the front hung too low. Would be good for later in pregnancy when my belly is bigger.
3.0,These underwear are true to size but I‚Äôm not happy with the quality it doesn‚Äôt seem like cotton at all.
3.0,"The piece is perfect, however, I would have preferred a thicker shinier chain. So dull."
3.0,"They show above the calf, but that is not the case... will not re-order, I had to give theses away."
3.0,I order what should have been a size too large and could hardly get the socks on.  Some came with small holes in them.
3.0,Concept is great- an all in one but it runs small and already has a hole in it. Didn't last me even 6 months.
3.0,Kinda cheap feeling but what do you expect for $20? I guess it‚Äôs what I expected. Kinda large though.
3.0,"For what I paid it is a cute outift, but the leggings aren't as snug as I would hope, or as long.  So they end up more like capris and not nearly as tight as pictured.  My daughter is 5 years old and a average size 5 clothes.  We ordered the 120 (size 5-6).  My daughter has short legs and can still fit in some size 4 leggings.  These 120s are a bit short and not snug.  The top fits as expected."
3.0,I ordered this waist trainer it was ok not curve friendly. Tried it on it gave me the worst back fat imaginable. So returned it I had ordered a medium per size description. Wanted to like it perhaps sizing would of helped but not on the width of the band.
3.0,"The necklace itself is fine--the CLASP is too small-difficult to hook up by yourself.  Once again, the necklace itself is good--looks good."
3.0,i am 140LBS 5'8&#34; B cup with small to average size hips and booty and a long torso. The center vertical strap was just a little on the short side for my torso and it was pulling at the top to make my mom boobs look even more saggy lol the horizontal strap was a bit too tight on my waist. so i cut the straps and made a regular bikini lol good quality of material.
3.0,"I think that I do not have the figure for this dress.  It is too clingy for me. For the price, I like it, but it is not for me.  I am going to give it away."
3.0,"I really like this  tunic but it was way too big for my medium, small busted frame."
3.0,Pretty but way too heavy
3.0,"Love the style. Fit is perfect. My only issue is the color of the flowers look more red and pink and they are actually orangey brown. Ordering the white one. I wish the color options pictured near the reviews,from the seller,  were available."
3.0,Cute dress but material is so thin you can see through it.
3.0,It's a cute skirt but the fabric was much thinner than I thought and was almost costume-like.
3.0,Doesn't really look like the picture
3.0,very heavy but very pretty.
3.0,Very cute and dainty. But it tarnished too fast
3.0,Nice necklace but the strands tangle even when you're wearing it.
3.0,"It's a great concept, and sure is easy to fold your suitcases, but it's not practical."
3.0,It fit a little small.  Maybe if I went up a size it might look better but I returned this one
3.0,bottoms are cuter than the top. not as cheap looking as some of the other ones. bra is kinda weird.
3.0,Strap is too long. Very annoying.  Other than that bag is perfect
3.0,"We did not receive a photo of all 7, and we got a duplicate of J-Hope. The photos look a little faded and not sure if it is intentional."
3.0,"Love the design, great colors. Got a lot of laughs, but only 3 starts because it's nearly impossible to see out of it."
3.0,The fabric seems of poor quality and it is too big
3.0,"Its OK. Though, it can't hold a car fob and 6 keys"
3.0,"These were very pretty and came in vivid colors. I have bought other styles in this brand and they were fine. But these have thick heavy elastic around the critch snd rubbed me raw. Furthermore, the crotch was too wide. The panties fit fine in the stomach area (my stomach is flat) but seemed cut way too short in the rump, like for a flat rear. They ended up rising higher in the front than in the back on me. Not going to buy this style again though pretty."
3.0,This bag was too large for me.
3.0,"These pajamas are very soft.  However; the top was way smaller than the bottoms.  I ordered children's size large but the top was tiny, more like a size toddler size.  I have to return these."
3.0,"It was a bit tight (but I've gained weight), and more importantly, it was too short. I expected above the knee, but it tended to slip well into the upper thigh. Basically, it's comfy and soft enough for a nightgown.... but too tight for that purpose. It's nice enough to wear outside... but too short for that purpose.<br /><br />And I don't really want to throw it away because it is really really soft."
3.0,Very fragile. The ears broke off after the first day but they are really cute on. Better reinforcement would be great
3.0,"Very cheap material, very very clingy. I will definitely have to wear a full shaping garment underneath to wear this dress. Also, it's a bit short in the front for me, I'll have to wear dark pantyhose and thigh high boots, but I'll find a way to carry this look off. I'm old, but not dead.....yet.<br />  Update: I let my 13 y o slender granddaughter wear it for Halloween. It looked so much better on her, so I let her keep it. Oh well, it was probably too young for me anyway."
3.0,I like the fact that its really soft but it was little shorter than I expected all tho the size was ok.
3.0,It‚Äôs not a snug fit sweater but more loose and casual
3.0,It was a good mask and I love the filter pockets but it was too small for my six year old. It‚Äôs better for toddlers
3.0,Run‚Äôs small
3.0,The sleeves on this dress seem to be smaller than the dress. It's a stretch type material so it's will fit very tight on the arms. Suggest ordering a size bigger because once it's washes it just may not fit.
3.0,"Gorgeous color and style, but It fit the lower half of my body and was too loose on my torso. Not flattering :("
3.0,"A little short in the back, but otherwise a good fitting  shirt"
3.0,I wanted to replace my old worn out Vera Bradley double case which I really like a lot for reading glasses and sunglasses in one soft separated compartment. I thought I was getting black/red/white like this picture indicates but the true colors are denim blue/coral/teal. SO different than I expected but is same pattern. I am keeping it only because it just lives in my purse for a functional purpose. The back has a sewn-in printed label that is not the same signature as all other Vera Bradley items. hmmmm
3.0,"Not fitted or tailored at all, as it appears online and it's definitely orange on the bottom half, not red, but good quality fabric."
3.0,"I recently ordered this costume and very much loved it BUTTTTTT there was some flaws, a hole under the armpit on the right side about it the size of a penny and the image in the front had been stuck together when I had pulled apart very gently it created a black whole in the top of the skeleton image, other than that amazing costume the straps and accessories that go to this are adorable!"
3.0,"Weird material won,t decrease after wash. Creases remain"
3.0,"Could have been cute but way too big, size down."
3.0,First day wearing it my zipper split. Otherwise it's a nice warm coat. Runs a little big. But I'm ok with that. I layer. I got the xl and wear a size 14. It's quite heavy too. And really long. But I like that as well. Decent coat. Just a crappy zipper
3.0,I returned it because it's so heavy to hang on a tree.
3.0,"Pretty fabric but strangely shaped. Rather square, for lack of a better descriptor, instead of slim and tall."
3.0,"Cheap quality- strings unraveled within a few weeks. Finally the strings snapped altogether. Nice looking bracelet, but would recommend you to spend money on better quality bracelet"
3.0,"It was very pretty at first, however by 3 or 4 weeks the heart actually broke in half. even though it was still pretty the same i had received many compliments for it. However the the bar keeping the bracelet together is actually very small and has made my bracelet fall at random many times. Then the worst of all, the silver started rusting into bronze where no one could even tell it was ever silver and the big diamond in the center of the heart fell. By the 5th month, i had to store it away..Know what youre going for."
3.0,"It looks nice but the sizing is not as expected. I wear an 8/10 which is generally a medium in most sizes, and that's what I ordered. I don't see a number anywhere on the dress and it's labeled as &#34;large&#34; (usually large means 12/14). It is bigger on me than what I'd expect an 8/10 to be."
3.0,Color was great. But one earring was twisted. Made very poorly.
3.0,"It runs large. Really needed an XS but it wasn't offered. Will have it hemmed about 6""  and hope the rest will draw in with laundering. Really like the dress."
3.0,Comfortable only after a couple washes.<br /><br />Slits for inserting knee pads is great. Phone pocket in front is useful. Can still get my phone out of it while sitting and I have a tactical muffin top that generally gets in the way.
3.0,"I am 5'8 and I ordered a medium - it's huge....  I would have been much happier with a small.  Also - the fabric is weird - not cotton, polyester."
3.0,Material is cheap n looks cheap
3.0,The holes in the pendants are too small for most chains to fit through. Especially if there is already a clasp on the chain.
3.0,"I brought this skirt for a birthday gift for my mother. She liked it! pretty design, the bow in front as a belt, the buttons sewed in front makes the skirt really fashionable. I gave 3 stars because is air dry after machine wash, i would have preferred machine dry, but if you dont mind it is a nice skirt."
3.0,They are adorable but are easy to break.
3.0,"Beautiful boots, comfortable heel height, but deceptively narrow in the shaft. My calves are 14.5 inches, and the description clearly states 15 inch circumference.<br /> And yet I couldn't for the life of me zip them shut! That zipper was NOT going past the calf. No use keeping them, they're getting returned."
3.0,These are more like standard ankle socks than anything else. They are also a bit thin and are not cushioned in the heel. They do fit well (I have large feet in size 9-10) but the compression is super mild.<br /><br />These are okay but not great. The six pairs in the package come in the following designs:<br /><br />- 2 white w/teal heel<br />- 1 white w/yellow heel<br />- 1 white w/red heel<br />- 1 white w/purple heel<br />- 1 black with teal trim<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) comes to $2.10 per pair.
3.0,I am an amazon clothing connoisseur. I absolutely love buying clothes off of amazon and when I found this shirt I figured that it would work well with leggings and cover my behind. Unfortunately it does not. It isn't short by any means but not quite long enough for me to feel comfortable to just wear leggings with it. I am 5' 2&#34; and 140lbs with a 32DD bust size.<br /><br />The material is also a bit strange. Not really soft like a t-shirt material but not rough either. I threw it in my washer and dryer a few times and that did help to soften it up a bit. I didn't notice any shrinkage after drying it in the dryer which i was pleased with.<br /><br />With the price I payed it really is a pretty decent quality.
3.0,"Soft and looks nice, although a bit thinner than I expected. Will be good for Spring.<br />UPDATE: After wearing this a few days I have to inform you- 1) This sweater snags if you look at it. And it snags BAD. 2) There is no knot in the fringes- you could literally unravel this whole sweater by pulling a tiny string from the fringe. I tied the end of all my fringe in knots to avoid this. I suggest you do the same if you get it."
3.0,I like the design but it's a bit heavy and thick.
3.0,Bottoms aren‚Äôt as padded as I thought they‚Äôd be
3.0,"Se distorsiona el sonido cuando est√° con el case, la parte de adelante se pega en la pantalla. Para usarlo s√≥lo cuando es estrictamente necesario est√° bien."
3.0,Made well and comfortable to wear but a bit big to stay in bra.
3.0,"Soft and stretchy, but a bit smaller than I expected."
3.0,Good looking but it‚Äôs too tight in my head
3.0,"This strap was really long and thick, was hoping for something thinner like the band it was replacing. More of a men's band."
3.0,defiantly too small and i ordered a size up.
3.0,Weak material.
3.0,runs kinda big in the chest. if you have a small chest i‚Äôd suggest sizing down!
3.0,I loved the design of the bodysuit an wish I could‚Äôve worn it out being It was a little tight when trying on I had an allergic reaction to the material on my shoulder after trying it on so sadly I had to return it but Other than that it looked exactly like the pictures and would definitely recommend it
3.0,"The horn itself is beautiful, I would recommend a different chain.  This is a gift so I was very disappointed in the chain."
3.0,my kid liked it. the zip up all the way is small.
3.0,Did not care for these pants. Way too long and not the best quality material. I returned them.
3.0,Great kids gift. Not an adult purse.
3.0,"The material is good, pretty cool.  But the cutting is a little off and it cannot be used when playing light water activity such as lazy river, etc."
3.0,"It is a cute bracelet! It is crafted good, the only prob I had was the crystals do fall out easy. It then looks cheap and I haven't wore it since!"
3.0,If there's a shirt with a bear on it at XL size and doesn't fit my size because it's too small then there's something wrong with the product maker.
3.0,Light weight comfy. Not much for compression but gives a smooth line under shirts.
3.0,"A nice, inexpensive gift, but the&#34;smarter than you think&#34; quote medallion has a typo."
3.0,"RETURNING THE ITEM, ORDER XTRA LARGE, CAME MED"
3.0,"It was too tight around the bust, even though I order a larger than usual size."
3.0,"Flimsy,  very thin and easily shrinks.."
3.0,"There is nothing between your glasses and contact case in this case.  To deal with this, we keep a cleaning cloth over the lenses.  Other than that, it is ok.  The contact case has a non standard center so you can't swap it out, have to take it out and clean it or boil it to reuse after a month or so.  The colors were not as vivid either.  We bought a black and green.  The green looked so close to black I thought they sent the wrong one.  It took a glare in the sun to see the color."
3.0,It came with black streaks on the white material.
3.0,The chain made the dress look elegant however it comes apart easily.
3.0,"Much shorter than I expected, even for my daughter who is 5'4. It's still short on her. I thought this would be floor length on her but it's still right above her ankle. He color is red, not red wine or wine red. It's red, I wanted it to be more towards the burgundy shade, but no. It's red!! Material is good, the flow of the skirt is good and it's not see through. My only issue is the length and the color (wasn't as dark as I wanted it) but it's still a nice color of you want more of a deep red."
3.0,I love the look of this watch but the band is awful. It's so flimsy it is quite an effort to feed the band through the loops when putting it on. It's also a heck of a challenge to pull the band back through the loops when taking the watch off. Even though it says it's waterproof I'd rather not wear it in the shower so I'm just gonna have to wear at occasionally to limit the frustration.
3.0,Nice color however the band is very big not having the option to choose s/m/l. Not a fan of the buckle closure.
3.0,Already has a run between the legs
3.0,"My friend with wide feet tried the shoe on, as well and it didn't fit her.  These shoes are made for people with very wide feet."
3.0,Thought these were black pearl earrings but they have a green sheen to them. Nothing was mentioned about them being green.<br />I do not like green.
3.0,"It looked more like a sack and sleeve just looked large, it was itchy as well"
3.0,Shinier material than I expected and fits small
3.0,only used it once.  seems to work
3.0,Colors are much darker than photographs.
3.0,"This watch is OK. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's bigger than I expected and seems unnecessarily large. Also, the buttons are not intuitive at all. So confusing. As in, I couldn't figure everything out kind of confusing, even with the instructions. But, it's light, has a good display, and the band is almost as good quality as my expensive GPS watch. I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
3.0,"The dress is very sheer, nice wrap tie. Ultimately I returned it because it was a bit too sheer for me. Might be nice with same colored lingerie under. Flattering cut!"
3.0,"Got this for a male relative and he said he liked it. However, the sparkling stuff on the rim makes it a bit more feminine than masculine. Would have preferred it didn't have that but hey at least he liked it"
3.0,"This is a nice simple dress for the price. Good quality. Just a minor disappointment- based on the other Miusol dress I purchased which was a perfect fit, I went with the medium but it runs big particularly in the bust and shoulder areas. I'll have to do some alterations for it to fit perfectly. I'm 5'5 and approximately 135 lbs. It hits just below the knee."
3.0,"The measurements were wrong, making it very tight. We had to wear it anyway unfortunately because it was a mandatory part of a costume. The sizing was the same as you would find on average in any costume shop hat. Not a bad hat though. No bad smells was a plus."
3.0,"I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and around 135. I like my clothes slightly loose so I usually order a medium and ordered a medium in this. It fit perfectly and it was long enough for me. The top could have been a little more fitted so my bra wasn‚Äôt showing, but I was okay with the slouchy look because the whole look of this dress is slouchy. I‚Äôve ordered one of these before from another seller and it was a nice, thick, cotton fabric. Whatever they made this out of was cheap and slippery, it felt like a nightgown, not a dress. 3 stars for cut, length & no weird odors...but I returned it."
3.0,Ran really small and the material is very thick.  I returned them
3.0,I am a 34 DD . The small is too large on top. I am a size 2 to 4. Not a flattering fit at all. Returning.
3.0,"For some reason I recieved an empty sealed package. Not sure where this happened, but Amazon has Great Customer Service and they credited it to a gift card. The pants  when you actually get them are great light weight and I paid taylors to put elastic as the bottoms flop around. But Great Price and Product."
3.0,its a good piece... but it's just one... why would you just sell ONE?
3.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, 155lbs, and usually wear a M/L in tops and dresses.  I ordered a Large in this dress and it was the appropriate size.  The dress is an unusual, not super stretchy, material-- kind of reminds me of that giant parachute you'd play with in gym class.  I can't tell if it would be prone to static cling or not.  The colors are more vibrant than expected, which is fine.  It fits perfectly across my shoulders, which is why the large was the correct size for me.  It's more loose from the bust down, where I could've gotten away with a medium.  I have a long torso and short legs and this dress went down to mid-thigh.  I wouldn't be afraid of a peep show, though I'd certainly have to be mindful of how I sat down."
3.0,Looks great on dress or casual. I thought it would be larger. Not thrilled with the earring.
3.0,It‚Äôs not horrible but not as nice as the photo. I‚Äôll probably end up giving it away because I just don‚Äôt like it on me. I wish it was more like the photo and the photos of other reviewers. I‚Äôm disappointed.
3.0,The product took a very long time to arrive.  It was pretty warm when the hat with face shield arrived and for some reason the air doesn't seem to circulate very well across the face.  Even in an air conditioned room within a few minutes while wearing this hat with shield I was sweating and so hot that I had to take it off.  Hopefully winter and cooler weather it will be more useable but it will be a few months before I can find out.
3.0,Smaller than expected but kids love em
3.0,My son was happy with it. It has a very sharp end so I was glad when it chipped and broke of a tiny bit.
3.0,Ok but sizing is off.
3.0,"I love the style of the band, I just wish it were a little bit longer.  Because it is snug, the clasp pinches my skin and is somewhat uncomfortable!!! I'm not sure if I will keep it as it will only become tighter during the Summer months!!"
3.0,Fits ok everywhere except the arm pits very tight
3.0,"The fabric and fit of these are great but the stitching is a bit uncomfortable, especially if you're running in them."
3.0,Some are cheaper looking than others.  Low grade materials
3.0,I usually get an xl but it suggested a large based off my usual picks and my sizing info I‚Äôve put in. It was wrong. I thought it was going to be a looser fit to begin with but even if I got the xl it still would have fit tight.
3.0,"Great quality sandal, but runs small. My son wears a 2 and I ordered 2/3 and had to return. I ordered based on the size chart."
3.0,"Great shirt but I could have ordered cheaper elsewhere. I went through this seller on Amazon in order to receive quickly, yet the order did not arrive as quickly as advertised. 4 stars for the shirt, three stars for the speed of delivery, and two stars for the price... for an average of three stars."
3.0,This hat is very cute to look at but the fit is not good. Unless you have a very large head this will be an awkward fit and push your ears down. On top of that it will never break in. The front of the hat has a very stiff cardboard like facing that cannot be removed and it‚Äôs a very scratchy material. Unless you have to have this style I‚Äôd look elsewhere. Hat is so stiff mine arrived cracked when the shipping box was damaged.
3.0,The dress was very not true to the size. Not even close
3.0,"Didn't care for this necklace when I got it. But that's not your fault, somebody would like it I'm sure."
3.0,Water damage after a month
3.0,"Super cute , however my reason for a 3 instead of a 5 is because the shoe is really flat no cushion at all for my little one's foot<br />I ordered a 12 to 18 months and they sent a size 3 which fits to size<br />Other than that its a very beautiful sandle for spring / summer"
3.0,"Its ok, I'm looking for a specific visor, a replacement for the Croakie Headgasket, and this one is close, but not quite it."
3.0,"Nice material. Looks like made well, but didn‚Äôt fit great. Kind of short if you have long torso."
3.0,They cute..but really small and I have small fingers
3.0,"The pants fit well but are made of very light weight/flimly material, not good for colder weather."
3.0,I use these shirts to protect my arms at work. The sleeves are too loose.
3.0,I get a headache just using this the chain is very dainty
3.0,Looks like it came out of a gum ball machine. Not impressed.
3.0,Nice quality. But runs small.
3.0,"Okay but not as good as I expected.  Hot, hot, hot!"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:812105d7654357e50561ce10932f5805]] The blue ones are on a amber lens donuts a driving brown color lens. Takes away the blues and same with the 24 k gold same lens. The mirror finish is see through. The grey lens has no mirror finish and is see through as well. Not close to Oakley quality but these are cheap and they actually are nice fitting. Picture is of the blue mirror coated lens with amber/ brown plastic
3.0,"The PJ's are cute, A little snug but I guess they are supposed to be. However I washed them straight from the bag never worn and one of the shirts has a REALLY strong onion smell. The bottoms were fine and so was the rest of the laundry not sure what was up I threw it away."
3.0,I loved the bracelet but was disappointed with the imperfection on the leather band as well as the tarnish on the metal closure.  I would truly love a replacement sent as I love the bracelet but feel it has imperfections.  See below pictures.<br />Thank you!
3.0,I should have paid attention to the reviews.  This sweater runs at least one size smaller than marked.  If you actually want to wear a shirt or cami underneath then I would order up 2 sizes.  I returned them.
3.0,"I absolutely adore this swimsuit! I am 5'5 and I typically wear a 14. I bought the recommended size and it fits almost perfect. Gives the body an enhanced hour glass shape. HOWEVER, as mentioned in other reveiws, the cups are awkwardly shaped. They are an extreme U shape. Not very wide. I wear a 36ddd. I fit into it but it's a weird fit. You can't notice just looking at it tho. I would still buy this again I live this swimsuit."
3.0,I am seeing a pattern developing when buying inexpensive head coverings.  They are going to be thin materials although they look good in display. This one is no different.  I will wear it but so-so.
3.0,"I have had the strap for around a month now and as can be seen in the close up photo that is attached the material on the side started to come off very quickly. I'd say it was less than a week before this started to happen. But for the price you pay what do you expect? The spring bar tool that comes with it is just a tad to thick to be easily used but will work with some effort. I compared the spring bars that came with the package and they seemed of similar quality to the ones that came with my watch (Seiko 5). The second photo is to just show the wear after about a months use. I'd still recommend the band as is still looks good even with that material falling off (I just peeled off most of it, left some for the review). And everything else seems to be holding up just fine so far. I'd have given it a 3.5 but only whole numbers here on Amazon. Was disappointed at how fast the side material started to fall off but otherwise great package deal with the bars and tool."
3.0,"The quality isn't the best, this could use a better lining on the tummy, the seem is a little shotty and cheap, and it doesn't make the girls look good in the slightest. But it's still cute and I still wear it, for the price you can't beat it."
3.0,Too small had to return
3.0,"After getting it, realized how cheap it was, but I got what I paid for. Gave it to my aunt who is a big hunter buff, she loves it."
3.0,Really did not make a difference for us.
3.0,"Loved it, but not much support for 40DD girls!"
3.0,Runs small and thin material !
3.0,These were great for the first few months of pregnancy when my pants were just slightly too tight to button. I docked 2 stars though because 2 of them broke due to the last hole being too close to the edge and splitting. I wasn't even using that hole yet so it split without any pressure.
3.0,It is beautiful but very long and super fitted - several inches too long. I bought the black one in the same size and it fit perfectly.
3.0,"Runs a little small, ordered large definitely should have ordered at least XL. I'm 5'8"" and weigh about 160 lbs. Nice feel and look. Would order again in larger size. Return was very easy."
3.0,"The gloves seem to be of excellent build quality, but they are WAY too tight. I tried both the 12oz and 14oz gloves. The 12s, I could barely get my hand into the glove. The 14s, I could, but once my hand was in, it was cutting off circulation. I am 6'0 and 185lbs, normal sized hands. I have noticed that a few other people have mentioned the same issue.<br /><br />Bottom line: just be aware that these are very tight!"
3.0,I think the most disappointing thing is that I've used it 3 different times I the same pair of leather boots and they still aren't comfortable. Maybe it's the thickness of the leather and not the product. I'm just not sure. I've used other stretcher before and it only took one application but that was for all kinds of materials. The boots were expensive and once I've got them stretched they will last a long time. I'm still optimistic!
3.0,"I ordered this dress in 2 prints, one in a size XL and one in an XXL, there was literally no difference in measurements tho.  The dress is fairly stretchy, and the material is textured, and fairly comfortable.  It was a bit short, but not too short.  It is nice enough to dress up for a more formal event like a wedding, or to just wear as a summer sundress.  Overall it is pretty good for the price."
3.0,The romper dress is really pretty. The shorts run a little tigher and short. I usually wear a size 6[US] am  5'5ft 120 pounds.will take for alterations since i havent been able to wear it.i'd prefer to separate the shorts from the dress.overall its a pretty outfit.
3.0,Cute shirt runs small
3.0,This top runs very big.  I returned it.
3.0,"Fit true to size.<br />Strong chemical smell, flimsy material almost like cardboard.<br />The print is cute and I will wear them but would not recommend or buy again."
3.0,Band are just ok Not perfect
3.0,"I wear size 7-7.5 and they wouldn't stay on my feet. But my daughter, size 8-8.5 loves them."
3.0,"Really cute. Can be worn as a dress. Not just a costume. The dress does fit a little awkward. Once on, I looms like the top &#34;shirt&#34; part of the dress should come down a little farther."
3.0,"It‚Äôs ok looking. Maybe just baggier looking onme than I had anticipated. The fur, once puffed up, looks nice, though not quite as full as in the model photo. The fit is good, as expected. Very warm. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and this comes to my knees."
3.0,They are very pretty.  The are one size fits most and i guess I'm not most.  I wear a size 7 shoe and they are too big.  No way to adjust them
3.0,Don‚Äôt buy these it‚Äôs really cheap quality.. all key rings broken
3.0,a lot smaller then lead to believe. the chains came off after a couple weeks but my daughter is still happy with them
3.0,"One for me, one for my boyfriend, is good! The quality is not the better."
3.0,Will use as nightgown. Very sheer
3.0,"Pretty long, could wear as a very short dress, but very cute and stylish. Comfortable & material seems good."
3.0,"A little orangey in color, but a great bag that's the perfect size."
3.0,I loved the outfit but the material was too rough and I have sensitive skin
3.0,"Nice and soft. Not much to them, but as comfy as they can be for $12 I suppose.<br /><br />Will not buy again."
3.0,"I took the advice in other reviews and ordered three sizes up, since I not only wanted it to fit but be loose.  That was a lucky thing because it wasn't tight but neither was it baggy.<br /><br />My big problem with this is that it's just a sweatshirt.  In the photo this seemed more like a tunic and it had white fleecy cuffs.  But while the red color is very nice and the cat imprint is ok, there are no fleece cuffs and the interior lining is a light tan.  It's also not that long and not as warm as I hoped."
3.0,"Good little watch for work. Not bulking, heavy, and looks really clean. Only complaint is the light is really dim and useless but other than that is a good basic cheap watch."
3.0,I like these short. But the sizing is off way bigger than was listed and it came over a month later
3.0,"A little stiff, hoping it softens so it lays  right"
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5,7 and 140 ordered M and it‚Äôs big and too long. Even with S size I‚Äôm pretty sure that you need to cut it. The material is very thin and you can see any underwear. 3 stars only for interesting colors and design."
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 210 lbs. Dress stopped at ankles and I would have rather dress been longer
3.0,Skirt not what I expected not flattering.  I do not like the bottom cut of the skirt I find it very unattractive. I wore it to work and I regretted it. I think it‚Äôs just a matter of subjective opinion but I did not like the way it fell.  I am a small to an extra small and it still was not flattering.
3.0,Was disappointed.  They bands kept coming off.  Did not stay on fingers.  Kids lost interest in them.  They were OK.
3.0,"Loved the Feel and Lightness, unfortunately, the romance only lasted about 1 Year (no roughness here!), the nose support attachment point broke at it's joint to the bridge, it was very difficult to find someone to repair and make it look anywhere good.... Five Stars for up to the first year!"
3.0,"This top was very, very tight.  I am normally a Women's medium and that is what I ordered. It was stretchy but definitely not a medium. Based on how tight it was, I think a large might be too small too. I really like the pockets though so I'm going to reorder an XL and update this review after."
3.0,Just heavy but is ok
3.0,The chest is VERY large. I wear B cups and could barely fill it out with my best bra. If you are bustier this would be very cute but not for the smaller chested.
3.0,The price was right but as others stated the hat came to me all folded up with big dents in the hat that woul not come out.
3.0,Have to return them because they are way too small. I ordered my normal size but they are a full 4 inches from closing! For a second I thought I had put on a lot of weight but then I put on another couple pair of pants the same size I ordered and THEY fit.
3.0,Too big.... Quality was good but it was just to big.
3.0,Definitely runs small. XX large runs X large to large. A lot thinner than expected.
3.0,"I brought my normal size (XL) (5'11, 240lbs size 14 pants and 40DD) the color matched what I saw on the screen beautiful purple. The fit was perfect for me in the body it was just too short for my liking to be considered a maxi. I will be returning but only because of the length. The support was good too."
3.0,Extremely light weight and a bit snug in the legs.  Overall usable though.
3.0,"5'6"" 185 lbs bought xl and it fits great - but as the day goes on they start to slide down.  Which gets really annoying.  I can fit into a large, but I bought a size up for my thighs.  Nice material, and feels nice on the skin.  Perfect for fall and winter temperatures.  They might be too warm for Summer temps.  They look exactly like the photo - which is a plus!  Won't buy again, because of the sliding issue, but if you're not super curvy - small thighs, you probably wouldn't have this issue."
3.0,Material cheap n thin
3.0,Cute pajamas but way too small. Not true to size.
3.0,Liked the style. I have an average sized head for an adult woman and it‚Äôs too big. I had to glue some felt inside it to make the hat not slide over my eyes and hug my head better. Well made tho. Shame I had to hot glue it.
3.0,Broken zipper.
3.0,"no me agrado que suda mucho la mano, tama√±o perfecto, solo para trabajos livianos"
3.0,Fell apart  really long but super cute
3.0,Dress material isn't what I expected. The mesh V neck definitely is deep. Overall didn't work for me.
3.0,The quality was just okay. It was nothing special to be honest.
3.0,"The fit in the torso was fine but the sleeves were pretty short on me (and my arms are a normal length). The embroidery on the front is already coming out and I am pretty sure when I wash it for the first time I will lose a lot more of the stitching. It is a really cute shirt style wise, its just that the quality isn't that great."
3.0,"The sizing runs small and the red is more of a bright artificial looking red, not the subdued brick/burgundy shown in the marketing photo. Order a size up for sure. Otherwise an okay dress."
3.0,The dress doesn‚Äôt flow. Very stiff at the bottom.
3.0,"It arrived quickly in s nice box. I guess I didn‚Äôt read the description. I did not realize part of the jewelry was fabric. The color of gold in the fabric and on the chains is different. Other that, it was a nice enhancement to plain dress."
3.0,"On the thin side and it sheds feathers, but it was ordered to fill out a gift bag for a coworker and fit the budget."
3.0,Fabric is nice. Made well. Shoulders and cap sleeve is not true to size.
3.0,Cute watch.  Instructions appear to be for a different watch.  I wrote Marciano about this as soon as I received the watch but all I've received in the intervening 7 days is an automated message in French advising that I would receive a response 2 days ago.
3.0,"they are ok, but not as good as advertsd...."
3.0,"It runs  REALLY  big. This is  suppose  to be a  child's one sized hat. Why does it fit a grown woman rather than a child? I wish they made it in sizes. Also, a circumference size (in inches) would be a great idea for the seller (hint hint)."
3.0,"The picture on the mask doesn't line perfectly up nose like picture shows, picture sits 1-1/2 down in middle and the hat is a little goofy looking like a civil wat hat or something but still love it so I hove It a 3 star rating"
3.0,I have several Columbia pieces and have 3 pairs of the Back Beauty shorts so wanted to try the pants. Unfortunately they were way too short for me. Wish they came in a Long or Tall. I typically wear a 14 or 14 Long. 5'9&#34;. Had to return. Aside from length would have worked well.
3.0,"Not the best quality, kind of big for chokers also. They slide down my neck a lot."
3.0,"I absolutely loved this dress! HOWEVER, once I received it and took it out from the bag it came in, it reeked like garlic? I can't really tell what it smells like. I washed it 3 times and the smell is still OVERPOWERING. My next option is to leave it at a dry cleaners because the smell is just so bad."
3.0,"The Diesel On Men's Hybrid Smartwatch. Is it really a smartwatch? No not really. It does a few things a smartwatch, and a fitness watch can do.<br />It has an alarm, it tracks your steps, and your sleep habits. As for working with your smartphone, I cannot comment on that as I do not own a smartphone. The watch looks good, is a little heavy on the wrist. Was easy to set up once I downloaded the app to my tablet. I think that there are better smartwatches on the market, but I suspect that most  will not look as good as this one."
3.0,"I wish charm was a little bigger, my plan was to attach it to a ribbon lei, as a keep sake lei."
3.0,Not a fit for all M Frame
3.0,It's nice. Thin material but feel good.
3.0,i gave this 3 stars because its a cute dress and i loved the color but the top was odd for me. i am large chested as a 36e cup and usually have a hard time covering them but the top of this dress was to much coverage. it fit like a choker on me the straps were so short i cudnt pull the neckline of the dress away from my neck. not how it was pictured at all or how the review pictures on here were. the straps being so short i was surprised to feel large gaps in the armpit that showed the sides of my bra. the top was not sewn together properly and didn't fit well at all!
3.0,"I really like the style of this watch band and it fit well.  The brown is a funny brown, kind of a medium brown. I like the fact that the loose end of the band is inside so nothing flaps.  I'm not sure whether I didn't have it fastened securely but it fell off.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) it hit the floor with a thud so I realized it right away.  Good thing I wasn't walking quickly through a noisy airport!  Now I'm afraid to use it."
3.0,I loved it but lost with in just a week or so. The clasp apparently wasn't strong enough to keep it from unhooking as I was out & about shopping. Sad because it was beautiful. Don't know if I will order it again.
3.0,"Nice fabric! Cool for hot weather. I ordered XL, which is my usual size, and it was true to size or a bit roomy! The only problem is that the shirring for the &#34;baby doll&#34; or peplum look is high in the front and low in the back, creating a dome the stomach area and a &#34;maternity&#34; look to this top! So, great AS a maternity top, but if you are not pregnant, it might make people ask if you are!!  Now that I look at the pictures, it does  show that it is higher in front and lower in back, but I didn't anticipate what that would do to the &#34;belly.&#34;"
3.0,"One star off because the elastic ends are really tight on my five month old and she isn't even chunky, only 13lbs. I needed leggings for the nig to keep her legs warm instead of putting pants on her, these do the job, I just fold them in half so there is no elastic on her thighs. They are pretty long for her too. Cute though!"
3.0,"They are cute, but mine came with a piece of hair with it.ü§¢"
3.0,I wasn't thinking how big 35mm would be - it is 1 1/2 inches across.  Way too big for me. but very cute for costume jewelry
3.0,Shirt is cute but stretches out after wearing. Doesn't hold shape well.  BElla Canvas tees r the best. Wish it was printed on that brand instead.
3.0,Wayyyyyyyyy too large.... nonetheless still cute
3.0,The dress was more yellow than I expected it to be. I also expected it be be longer but it was not.
3.0,Definitely runs small. I'd recommend ordering one possibly two sizes bigger than what you wear. It is made from Halloween costume material. So tent like materials not soft fabric. It barely fit my daughter but worked for a one night wear on Halloween. It is short and multiple pieces.
3.0,"I received this dress yesterday.  I've been contemplating the purchase of this dress for months.  But however, it wasn't what i thought it would be.  I returned it."
3.0,They overall quality is great and the shape is very cute but it is not the type of material I was expecting. I was wanting more of a t-shirt type feel to it but this is more spandex than anything. It's like the fabric that work-out clothes are made from.  I will work fine for under cardigans and longer sweaters. For a thin fit person this would've awesome!
3.0,"I bought this to keep dry in the summer rain. It was thin enough with plenty of ventilation for the summer. However, it failed to keep me anywhere near dry. I didn‚Äôt expect miracles..."
3.0,Comfy but the color is way off from the pictured color.  Casual but dressy enough for work.
3.0,leave a muffin top despite going up a size. The crotch area knit is strange too.
3.0,"Beautiful, but a little larger and kind of curved in a weird way. Too large to wear day-to-day, but mostly becuz my daughter loves to play with it. The ball was difficult to remove at first, so i used pliers and its been easy to twist on and off since. Slightly faded color, but pretty, and feels like good medal."
3.0,"Not bad, the design is super cute but it's not a sweatshirt.  I feels like a thick long sleeve shirt. Kinda disappointed that is not a sweatshirt. Still like it though."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but there is no support on top at all.  I've tried adhesive bras, pasties, and bra liners but nothing seems to do it. I think it would be better if ther straps were adjustable. It's a cute dress and fits true to size if you don't mind your bra showing a bit in the front."
3.0,Chrono does not work properly but for the price it was expected.
3.0,"A bit too dark, hard to tell its navy blue, look almost black"
3.0,a little to sensitive fabric rips
3.0,"Soft material, but also pretty see-through.<br />Also had two small holes on the front near the shoulder.<br />At first I thought I'd buy it in another color, but after seeing the holes, I think not."
3.0,I love the set. I just wish the earrings were the size of the pendant and the pendant was larger
3.0,These are very very comfortable but I bought them for the smiley and those are falling off within 2 months of owning these.
3.0,I got this thinking I would be out running since I'm still too scare to go back to the gym.  The sound quality is nice but the beanie is super tight.  I supposed it would stretch out with wear and No- my head is not extremely big.  Probably your average size noggin here but I'm definitely getting hat hair for a while with this until it loosens up.  Easy controls and touch buttons on the side.  Works well with my Samsung Galaxy Note.
3.0,"Being 5'3, this skirt is way WAY too long. I have tried it on with 5 inch heels and still find the skirt sitting at the bottom of the floor. I will probably recommend this skirt for taller ladies. This skirt fits a little higher up the waist for me. Perhaps I ordered the wrong size. However, the quality of the cloth is top notch. I just wished it wasn't so incredibly long!"
3.0,Fit well and easy to install. I don't wear it very often because the print is already starting to wear off. Never used during a workout.
3.0,"Product is okay not a daily driver, it will be for my bill mgmt system only. Its kind of shiny which i dont like as much,  but for my needs it will work"
3.0,Feels like the clip on the top is going to break off. Hard to apply. Really cool looking once in place.
3.0,Pretty.  Very light.  I didn't expect it to be so thin.
3.0,"These were smaller and stuck on my stomach more than I wanted them to as well as being very thin. Not exactly see-through, but on the boarder line."
3.0,I bought my usual size but this dress must run small.  It‚Äôs a little bit tight.
3.0,"This is a very pretty necklace. I only see one flaw and that's the chain. It's a little thin and gets tangled easily when placing it in a jewelery pouch or such to travel. Nothing I can't undo, just takes some time or a needle or something to get a knot here and there out.<br />I still would buy it again though. Maybe they'll add a thicker chain."
3.0,This is a nice robe but it runs really small.  I wear a large and ordered a 1x just because I like my robes roomy. This fits more like a medium/large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and it comes about 4‚Äù above the floor.
3.0,"The shirt runs small. I can usuall wear a large in men's and it will be very loose like I prefer. This however ran small and is snug and uncomfortable. Poor investment, cheaply made. I kept it because it was the only shirt I have seen that wasn't a T-shirt. It was expensive and cheaply made. nade,"
3.0,"The color is vibrant; however, the fit is a bit snug.  Also, there is a seam down the entire back.  I was hoping for a comfortable fit; however, all I can feel is the thick seem down my back."
3.0,it was not as white as the picture--more off-white
3.0,I love my romper! I didn't know the back was totally out.I wish there had been a picture showing the back of it . I had to improvise since I can't go without a bra
3.0,Ok shirt but colors not as bright as the photo.
3.0,"This was a nice looking headband, but it had no give and was too snug for my head."
3.0,Seem to fit smaller than the size noted.
3.0,It works to clean the jewelry there just isn't enough of it and the blue will pill on you.
3.0,Dress is rather tight. Not as stretchy as I am used to. Would suggest ordering a size or two larger than what you normally wear.
3.0,for the price.. it is fine. There were a few small holes in the fabric.
3.0,"I‚Äôm very athletic with very muscular legs, but I also have a tiny waist. So these were extremely tight on my calves/thighs/butt, but they were falling off my waist. They are cute though... so I still have them three stars. I just can‚Äôt wear them to workout or anything."
3.0,They are true to size but they run very long. The material is soft but it‚Äôs kinda heavy.
3.0,I thought they were suppose to be sterling silver ... disappointed in the quality.  Very light and almost plastic looking.
3.0,"Had to put some oil on front zipper @ bottom part of bag, cause it seemed like it wanted to stick, or teeth were gonna seperate...think I won't use that zipper. But overall satisfied."
3.0,I have ordered several bow ties in this brand for my son‚Äôs dance recitals over the past 4 years so it was a no brainer to order for this year. I was looking for a matching bow tie and cummerbund in blue. My son is almost 8 but very skinny and on the short side so I chose the smaller size. The coloring is perfect for what I wanted. The bow tie is a little small  (not the strap but the actual bow tie) but I think reasonable for a toddler or preschooler. The cummerbund fits my son on the tightest setting (whew). Good thing I got the small! The only thing I‚Äôm not 100% happy with is the cummerbund because it is lopsided. I‚Äôm not sure if you can tell in the picture but look where the bottom pleat connects to the band on the right as compared to the left. I think it will still be ok at 20 feet away and the price was good.
3.0,The bag looks just like the designer version but so obviously not real leather like advertised. Don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm keeping this
3.0,"Strangely I had to size down one and that made it fit really well but the chest is too large. Can't do much moving around without showing off way too much. Love the fabric, design, fit otherwise - it might just be me, would recommend you try it for your body type. Just didn't work for me."
3.0,"I really love the look, versatility and style of this romper, but it's a bit short in the crotch making it look like it's riding up your butt."
3.0,i like them but they are a bit tight for man arms. i feel like thread will break to fit my arms at some point. just a matter of time
3.0,The. Color is awesome. Just like it said. Sleeves are somewhat short. But it works. So cute with jeans and boots
3.0,"Great fabric. True to size, I ordered a 3x. It's cute and comfortable in the arms buuuut....that last gray stripe on the bottom is right across the muffin top. Even in yoga pants, it's on display. If you have a flat tummy and curves everywhere else it would be great or use spanks, that's what I'm going to try."
3.0,The bottoms did not fit me very well. And the top was really hard to take off when wet. Considering I got a large and the colors were so bright I really wanted it to cover just a tad better. Material is great quality and I did not have to wash it on delicate cycle.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.
3.0,"The fit was true to size and the graphic is cute. I am not a huge fan of the rolled up sleeves which are stitched in that position but they are ok. If you plan to run in this shirt, be aware the graphic is a plastic iron-on which traps a tremendous amount of heat."
3.0,Pretty. I love how they all came individually wrapped. Some of the color combinations  are a little weird.
3.0,"Cute but way too small. It wouldn't close at all over my chest.  I ordered my typical medium. Even if i sized up I doubt it would make much an impact.  If you are more than an A or small B cup, I would highly doubt if it would work.<br /><br />It would look silly if I tried to wear a cami underneath, that's how small it was up top.  I returned.  Pretty print though! Wish it would have worked."
3.0,Smaller than what is normally sold for this size
3.0,This was cheap and basically looked it. I no longer own it.
3.0,They are good for smart phones but in colorado my hands still get cold. I like them when it's not too cold but not good for everyday in the mountains.
3.0,iIs ok but not great for me.  doesn't fold flat.  works ok but cheap looking
3.0,I love the design of this shirt but it came a little too large. Also the cloth is 65% polyester and 35% cotton.
3.0,"I thought these were hipsters but after a couple of washings, fit much smaller than that."
3.0,Not as full as I had hoped. But a nice little scarf for a quick outing. Looks like it has been hand crocheted.
3.0,"I was expecting it to be long, but it‚Äôs snug around my waist. I‚Äôm a size 8, and usually wear a large on bottom as a 5‚Äô4‚Äù Woman, but I should have ordered an XL."
3.0,I love the dress but it was to large and they didn‚Äôt have one in my size
3.0,Skull face on the back is very uncool
3.0,"Good colors. Cheaply made, don't sit straight on the face and comes apart often. For the price,  I kind of expected it though."
3.0,"Although the item looks like the picture the ruffles are way too big, it took me awhile to figure this item out. I can't return the item as I live in South Africa but the company gave me a 30% discount, which I highly appreciate- thank you!"
3.0,Don't know why but I wasn't expecting it to be cotton. Arrived very wrinkly of course and hard to get them out. Also too small. Great design and exactly as pictured.
3.0,It got the job done but The skirt was extremely long and the pumpkin was too far down the shirt so you couldn‚Äôt really see it. For the most part it looks like the picture Kinda...
3.0,yeahhhh...it's nice though.
3.0,I love the colors and quality but I only received 3 when it was advertised as 4. Even the packaging says ‚Äú4pcs‚Äù
3.0,Wallet quality appears to be good. Once loaded with cards it's a bit difficult to get them out. You pretty much have to take them all out to get the one you need.
3.0,Tight fit I'd recommend order a larger size
3.0,Looks kinda silly on my sons head. Came flattened and it never stood back up. Totally crushed‚Ä¶ both my son AND the hat.
3.0,Much larger than expected. Too large for my purse.
3.0,It's cute but the h with supposed real four leaf clover don't seem sturdy I'm scared it will fall off. And I'm unsure if the clover is real like stated.
3.0,Great everyday top. It just took awhile to get it from China. I have the dark grey and this grey.<br />Its nice to have the pockets and I like the v-neck.<br />I'm 5'9 and it falls below my hips. I wear it with jeans and leggings. More on the casual side.<br />I gave it 3 stars because of the length of time it took to receive it.
3.0,"Nice for the price, quality is okay."
3.0,Why would they put seams on the bodice of this otherwise cute dress?  They run right down the boobs.  No thank you.
3.0,"Pretty material, cool and comfortable but the armholes are too large."
3.0,"Very nice looking and it actually got here a little faster than I had expected, but the quality is pretty cheap!<br /><br />Within the first few minutes of wearing it the elastic band started to unravel. I cut off the excess edges and had no problem with unraveling after that, but less that a week later the knot came undone!<br /><br />It was less than $1 when I purchased it, so what exactly was I expecting the quality to be!?"
3.0,"Cute gloves but the ribbon is very thin and not strong enough to hold the gloves up to the elbow. They just shrink back down and look like baggy wrist length gloves. My arms are pretty skinny so maybe that's why they won't hold up, I'm not sure."
3.0,Super cute top and nice quality.  I ordered an XL though and I'm swimming in it.  I'll have to return it for a smaller size.
3.0,"Like the shirt bought it to wear to work for christmas. I wear a size medium so thats what I ordered, but there is no way this is a medium. The shirt has to be a large but what makes it diffuclt to tell is the shirt tag the one that should be on the inside of the back collar is torn off.  That is how the shirt arrived today and can't return it because I needed it for tomorrow. So I am going to throw it in the was to try and hopefully shrink it some. Its a shame since I really did like the shirt, if you decide to buy one be very careful about the size because you don't know what you are going to get."
3.0,It's a nice light weight but it does wrinkle. I just use some spray wrinkle remover and it takes them out. I don't need an iron.
3.0,Got the cap it was okay wasnt spectacular or anything I expected more but you get what you pay for
3.0,"Very good quality, but the XXL size is too short. If you are tall it won't fit comfortably."
3.0,"Oops...did not see that it‚Äôs a junior cut and runs small. All the other women‚Äôs sized tees from Ann Arbor I bought were perfect in an XL. This one was definitely a size smaller than the women‚Äôs sized ones. It seems like the neckline is cut a little lower as well, so I may need to just choose something else. Bummer...loved the print!"
3.0,I found the top quite baggy and with too much fabric
3.0,These are adorable but one outfit fit my daughter and the other outfit was too small. That shouldn't happen with a 4 piece set.
3.0,It's a weird length and I can't get the laces proportioned the way I want them but it's still cute.
3.0,Size up if xlg get xxlg .. lace at bottom not sewed on very well .
3.0,"Very pretty, just runs too small. Trying not to buy from China, they keep sneaking it in!"
3.0,They smell really bad. Like strong rubber.
3.0,"very fast shipping, was in my mailbox three days<br />after i had placed order.. although<br />i was pleased with shipping.. the gem was a little<br />darker and doesnt seem to shine as much as in the picture.<br />the clarity can only be seen in the sun.<br />but i have gotten good compliments soo far..."
3.0,Nice top. Ordered a large it fit good
3.0,It's cheap so I wasn't expecting great quality.<br />My original band broke so I had to get this replacement. It's what it is for the price.<br />The edges from the moulding aren't super clean but it is reliable. Keeps my device snug in the band and stays on my wrist.<br />Harder to put on because the innate shape of the band is straight rather than bent around my wrist.
3.0,"They are good in the beginning but after going through the wash they fall off in the back. Not sure, however, if tehre is anything that can be done with this type of sock."
3.0,"I ordered a Small in this set but received a small top with an XS bottom.  I was happy with quick response and a replacement bottom.  However,  I was disappointed to see that the linen is of a lighter weight and a different color than the top.  The pajamas are comfortable and versatile, well made and a good price, but I would prefer to have a matching linen fabric in both top and bottom; my reason for 3 stars."
3.0,Decent quality but thin. Kind of matronly
3.0,"I had to take it in for alterations because it was too big around the waist. The alterations caused shiny-looking imperfections. Once finished it was super cute. I love the top part, but waist too big"
3.0,"They are so cute and looked so good. My daughter loved them but unfortunately the part of the arm that fits the hinge of the glasses was thin and broke after two days of minimal use. We have two pairs and one is intact, just bummed one broke so easily."
3.0,"We ordered a 3xl and it was no where near that size. Maybe it's China sizes, maybe they tagged it wrong or sent the wrong size either way this  fit our son who is an xl. It is very small. It is tagged as a 3x so not sure if it runs small or they just messed up somewhere. The suit itself does work and will get you sweating in no time."
3.0,"These boots are nice... they are probably my 5th pair of Emu boots. Though I like them, I'm not in love with them. Like many other boot brand that used to be amazing, the overall quality seems to be declining. These are nowhere as warm as my past pairs. It may seem weird, but the soles get cold. They look great and I get tons of compliments. They just aren't the level of warmth that I came to expect from this brand."
3.0,gift for my mom material was a lil thin...
3.0,Effective but very cheaply made and photo makes it appear as though they are one piece but they have Velcro poorly sewn to each side. If your going to be using them where looks doesn't matter they'd be ok.
3.0,"As advertised. It is lightweight and quality 4 value equivalent. I did appreciate that a laundry bag was I included. It is only large enough for underwear, but that is good enough for me."
3.0,"The glasses are nice, Except I ordered 250 and got 300."
3.0,Love the top of this swimsuit. It is a little too big where my boobs are at. I will probably end up returning this for a Large. Overall I love the cross cross straps in the back and the flowy tank around the bottom.
3.0,"4 stars because if you don‚Äôt prepare your harness properly with pod henge facing towards your release strap then you WILL spill an entire pod or more everytime you go to pull the strap.<br />If you buy these then make sure the pod open side is not facing towards the strap side that you pull. I found that if you do this the pod doesn‚Äôt spill as easy, most definitely need to be more cautious with this, I wish I would have gotten the strapless Zero G pod harness from HK!!"
3.0,This was not what I expected the pants were boxy and the top was long and just miss shaped-
3.0,"Loved these shoes for my son when they first arrived. He's worn them twice a week since August and now they are trashed. The sole on one came halfway off the shoe. He only wore them to school and home and never &#34;played&#34; in them as he has separate pairs of gym shoes,  &#34;play&#34; shoes, and school shoes. I guess I was expecting longer life of the shoes."
3.0,"Loved the look and the weight, but the strings broke on at least half of the masks. So much so that I haven't used the last 20 or so because of afraid it would break when I am out somewhere."
3.0,Looks dressier in photo but material is like T-shirt material.
3.0,Chain could be a little thicker
3.0,I liked the print and the color. I was disappointed with the fit. For the price I really wanted these to fit for a little while so I ordered a size up. The fit perfectly so unfortunately we won‚Äôt be getting any extra time out of them.
3.0,"Fits snugly for a size large causing shoulder pains while wearing/ first time try on, had to hurry and immediately unzip  the top part from the discomfort. Going to return and reorder but in a size XL. Material seems nice and sturdy. Just make sure to order a size up to be on the safe side."
3.0,"They are functional, BUT It's NOT this blue- mine were definitely TEAL - don't hand these out to a men's hockey team..."
3.0,Ok I misled by the pictures
3.0,I love the dress although the first one I ordered in size large was just a little small. This fits almost perfect. The waist is a little high. The problem I had with this one was the edges were not finished properly. The stitching should have been tighter.
3.0,"Item is cute, the buttons on the bottom are cheaply made and to stay clipped."
3.0,"I bought an XL, most of the dress fit, but the arms were so snug i couldn‚Äôt move comfortably. Returning."
3.0,"The metal buckle is surprisingly large and heavy which you may not notice on picture, although I like the stopping mechanical. The packaging is also average. I have bought two as a gift. The boxes do not carry nice advertising logo or else, but a brown box with very very large word &#34;Made in China&#34;. What do people think if you are the one receiving the gift......... So, three stars are maximum."
3.0,"The ring fit perfectly, however I'm a little disappointed in how light in color my dog came out.  The pic I sent of a brown dog showed his true color brown."
3.0,Good stockings but the sizes are smaller than marked.
3.0,"These are nice and get the job done, but they feel a little too cheap. They're very thin and lightweight."
3.0,The tops are very loose
3.0,"I'm no the tiniest person, so it's a little snug, but beautiful! The clasps are a little awkward, there is a hook and a clasp on both sides, so when one side hooks the other clasps, but once it's on it's on it's not a problem."
3.0,This is a very cute purse. Larger than I thought. A lot of the stitching was frayed as well as the knotting.  I did have to do some stitching around the zipper and to keep the knotting from unraveling.
3.0,It was smaller and thinner than expected.
3.0,The fabric is nice but with no stretch at all.  The elastic in the waistband rolled after the first wash
3.0,bought wrong product.
3.0,"I do find this a nice change to get away from the pain and hassle of bra straps, but I will not wear it with anything that isn't rather baggy. There is too much material in the back area and it either sits right above my waist, which gives a weird bulge, or I bunch it up so it is more on line with where a regular bra sits. It does also give a weird bulge in the front above the breasts. I'm keeping these, but see them as more something to wear in the cooler weather when I can layer, so the weird bulges don't show."
3.0,BUCKLES ARE HARD TO OPERATE
3.0,"I love the colors but this suit is just okay. Five stars for the top and two stars for the bottom for a 3.5 star rating.<br />The top is perfect .. fits well, pushes up well and ties nicely.<br />The bottom is too large and I don't care for the pink piping, which is actually sewn stitch marks and not solid piping as I had pictured.<br />I wish the pieces were sold separately as I could have gone with two different sizes, the L top and M bottoms.<br />Leaving for vacation tomorrow so I'm going to settle. I do love the top so I'll probably just wear it with another black bikini bottom I own."
3.0,It is running small.
3.0,"It's a really cute design. I was hoping that sizing up would make it a little baggier, but boy I was wrong. It runs probably about 2 sizes too small. I got an XXL and it is so snug. It's also pretty thin, paired with how tight it is, you can see my bra and tattoos through it. ): oh well"
3.0,"Purchased for a themed day at work, and obviously considering the warmth a onesie would provide I worked up a sweat. So if you're seeking a onesie that will keep you warm look no further. It was cute and comfortable, somewhat reminiscent of both a deer and a fox. Received many compliments. My only complaint would be that it fit larger than expected, in addition to constant shedding."
3.0,"I bought an extra large as I'm typically a large or extra large in most shirts. This one is clearly designed to be a bit baggy but the extra large was huge. It's a nice, comfy shirt and will be perfect for a day out running errands, a trip to the movies, or just hanging out at home. No real complaints about it!"
3.0,Fit is great! But not the dress shown
3.0,"I thought the outfit online was perfect for a costume party I am attending.  I read the reviews where some customers mentioned it wasn't true to size.  But I took the risk anyway - but I definitely agree it isn't true to size.  This isn't a sweater dress, but more of a sweatshirt that you can wear with leggings or with a skirt."
3.0,Feels nice on the wrist but pretty quickly wore down even without everyday use.
3.0,Runs a size smaller. If you order this item then order a size or two larger than you wear.
3.0,They are pretty.  But each are quite heavy and the pin isn‚Äôt strong enough to stop them from pulling downward when worn.  Needs a sturdier pin for placement!
3.0,Design of chef hat did not fit well on a toddler‚Äôs head. Apron fine.
3.0,Super cute! Fits perfectly. Sad tho there was a whole in the back of the dress. Might return and get a new one.
3.0,"First let me say the positives, it fits perfectly, it's light and it works. Here are my concerns. It's extremely fragile, you had better keep it in the case or it will scratch easily. Bends easily."
3.0,Pretty pattern...way too large.
3.0,It wasn't flattering on me.
3.0,"First off i recieved this product at a discounted price. Having said that This product isnt bad by any means. its a beautiful design and made of light flowy material, the kind thats super comfy to sleep in. It just wasnt the right product for me. Im 5'3 180 pounds and am a DD bust size and let me tell you i was overflowing in the bust area. nearly ripped the thin fabric. Ordered another in a differnt color and bigger size.. Still too small mostly in the bust area. i intially started with a large. Overall, just not for me"
3.0,"Earrings look great. Price was really good.  But wore them once for about 2 hours, my ears swelled up and itched for three days. I've never had this problem with stainless steel. I am very allergic to nickel. The ad said no nickel. I won't try this brand again."
3.0,"The fabric is nice and light, the colors beautiful , but the sizing runs VERY small.I ordered 2 in different colors and both had to be returned. I was sad as I really liked them."
3.0,Beautiful colors and and soft fabric.  Fit is good.  But the neckline is too low and really not flattering.  I will keep it and wear around the house but not much in public.  It is comfortable.  Wash and hang to dry.
3.0,"this product is flat, it does not fit around your face. when u look down u cant see anything it obstructs your vision. when the mask is turned on you can hear a ringing noise. the velcro that is on the only strap to stay on your head, that velcro doesnt stay attached to the elastic it is glued too. i also glued black ribbon to the mask so the lower half of the mask would stay closer to my heard. did i like the mask, it was just ok. the picture that was advertised with the mask on Amazon made me feel that you would only see the mask, not the back of my head. but no, that isnt the case. for the price that i paid, nope wouldnt really recomend this product to anyone. the battery pack for the 9volt battery wont close when the battery is in its case, you have to jam the cover on. that i didnt like. in my opinion when u pay such a high price for a mask you shouldnt have to fix it."
3.0,"First of all, the hat I received looks like the photo, but does not have Elope Inc. anywhere on it. This item seems to be a somewhat cheaper version of the one pictured, made by a company called Ruckus.<br /><br /> The colors are a bit brighter than pictured, and the fabric is a bit thinner than expected. The hat is much &quot;taller&quot; than it looks in the picture, about 20 inches along the seam from the edge to the tip, with the pom-pom adding its two-inch diameter to the overall length. It seems to stand up in the photo, with a bit of crumple, this one (as its thin) flops over to hang down the side of one's face with the pom-pom down on the shoulder.<br /><br /> Overall, this is a cute hat, but expecting another wonderful product from Elope, this was a bit of a disappointment."
3.0,Everything is perfect except for the magnet.  It looks like it‚Äôs been used and scratched numerous times.  Am I being too picky?  Is the magnet supposed to look like this?
3.0,This is another product that I thought was over priced for the quality of the T-shirt. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3.0,Got it as a gift and my gfs initial reaction was priceless(she's a lotr nerd lol) but when she out it on we noticed the middle piece was like / instead of l.  Kinda disappointed but she looked past it
3.0,"Its  CUTE HAT, LIKE THAT IT REVERSIBLE, BUT IT WAS WAY TOO LARGE. aM GOING TO TRY AND WASH TO SHRINK IT."
3.0,I little narrow. Fun colors.
3.0,"These look really good and stay in place well. The problem, however, is that the posts are thicker than any other pair of earrings I‚Äôve ever owned. It can sometimes be difficult to even get them in my ears and it can be painful. Once they‚Äôre in, it‚Äôs not too bad. I just wish the posts were thinner and so I‚Äôm hesitant to recommend these. Just be aware of this before you decide to buy"
3.0,"If this doesn't work, call a gamblers' hotline. ;-)"
3.0,"Runs 1 size small , great suit for a modest woman, not enough cleavage for me"
3.0,Very cute outfit but the elastic band in the tutu was completely twisted and took some time for me to fix &amp; the ears on the headband kept sliding off as my daughter wore it.
3.0,"The length was a big too long to be flattering on my height of 5 foot 5 inches, 210 lbs. I bought the size 16.  Which was a little big, but I think a size 14 possibly might be too small. Dress was plain, nothing special on me. The material was not great."
3.0,"Pros: material is so soft, the design of the top flares out perfectly to hide any tummy, and it's really adorable!!<br />Cons: NO support in bra area, no elasticity in bra area so it feels like it could fall down at any time, the pads inside are the same for plus size as A cups (like some kind of search and find nipple cover) and do not stay put at all, and the straps are SUPER flimsy... Like could break at any small movement. My boyfriend thinks he can reinforce the straps somehow so ill keep it to wear at our pool but going into the water at all might be iffy üòÖ"
3.0,"Dress fits wonderfully and looks great. Problem came in washing the garment. Even following the tag directions, the red skirt dye ran, and dyed the white stripes pink. Does not look damaged, but doesn't look like it was when it was new. Plus side, no shrinking!"
3.0,Threads everywhere
3.0,"I bought this as a high school graduation present for my daughter who likes chunky necklaces. I looked online for a chunky necklace I could get engraved, and I came across this one, the pictures online show a thicker necklace than the one I received. The necklace looks well made but it‚Äôs so thin I hope it does not break. The coin charm with the engraving is very nice. I don‚Äôt know if the necklace is sterling silver I did not see the 925 stamp on the necklace I did however see it on the charm. The necklace came in a nice box but I was so disappointed with the thickness, I believe my daughter loved the coin charm with the engraving therefore she decided to keep it and did not want me to return it. I will see how long it will last, I honestly feel I overpaid for this necklace since I don‚Äôt know if necklace is actually silver. Please see pictures I‚Äôve attached to see the actually size of the necklace."
3.0,Might be okay on some but I thought this was too big and boxy.
3.0,husband really liked<br /> them but they broke the first week. :(
3.0,The ruffle on the top does not lay appropirately! Annoying however the swimsuit fits very well
3.0,I bought them for my granddaughter but the posts bothered her ears. Had to take them to a jewelry friend to put posts on that wouldnt bother her.
3.0,I'm tall so this doesn't work for me
3.0,"This product fit a bit smaller than expected. I read several reviews before purchasing, and many suggested to go up one size. They were absolutely correct. The product description, as well as the size chart provided by Amazon, gives you pretty specific measurements, however the measurements told me to order a medium and I ordered a large. I have a 32 inch waist, and large is suggested for a 36-38 inch waist (medium is 32-34), so I was skeptical that the large would even fit. However, after having gone up a size, I still find the waistband to be a bit snug. I double checked all the packaging and tags, and they are marked as large. I highly recommend going up one size from the listed sizing chart.<br /><br />Other than the sizing confusion, this product is of average quality. Threading has already come unraveled on 2 of the 5 boxer shorts, and they've only been worn for one day and washed once. The designs look nice, the fabric has a decent feel (though not quite as soft as the Joe Boxer polyester boxer shorts that made me so fond of this material), but you can tell they're not high quality. As polyester boxers have become harder and harder to find in brick and mortar stores, at least in my area, I'm fairly satisfied with my purchase. But I'm not thrilled like I was before they arrived. Were they easier to obtain, I'd probably return these. I wish Del Rossa sold them individually, so as to be able to sample the product before purchasing in quantity. I can see why they wouldn't though.."
3.0,"It's a very nice pendant, but much smaller than I expected, so the picture makes it look more intense as a symbol of power/magic. The skulls at the corners are well done, but so tiny you can barely tell they are actually skulls. It's a nice piece to wear under your clothes for whatever personal meaning it has for you, but I don't think it's going to impress anyone if you're planning to wear it as jewelry that other people might actually see. Still, it's the best piece of hexagram jewelry I've been able to find and I didn't want something that was a standard/typical looking Star of David, so this works for me. It just doesn't give off the personal vibe I thought it would like my dragon pentagram pendant or my Sigil of Baphomet pendant, which is also circled by skulls which actually send a chill down your spine. A nice addition to my collection, but it would be MUCH better if it were just a little larger."
3.0,"The dress arrived on time but fits smaller than expected and it is SUPER SUPER SUPER sheer. Too see through for my liking. Pretty style, looks like the pictues and the materia is nice."
3.0,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON AND IT IS A  BIT SMALL AND EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET. KNOW YOU ARE PAYING FOR THE DIAMOND NAME BUT REALLY NOT WORTH THE COST IN THE LONG RUN.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
3.0,Good but they loose the color too fast and looks ugly multy colored
3.0,This is typical China stuff. Cheaply made and took a Long time to be delivered. Something good? Hmmm.... the color is nice
3.0,"Overall good quality fabric and design. However, there is one downside which costs two stars: the handle on the pocket zip is SHARP, you might cut yourself and people close to you if not careful."
3.0,I  had first purchased this dress in blue. I liked it enough to come back and get some more colors. I was so disappointed when I received my gray dress. It was smaller than the blue which wouldn't have been too big of a deal but it was completely lopsided in the shoulders. Totally uneven. The V neck seam is pretty off center. There appears to be consistency problems that I also noticed in some previous reviews.  I may give them another try. The return policy is so great that it doesn't feel too risky to give clothing a try on Amazon.
3.0,Loved the look of this band and it was comfortable. But after multiple hand washes and sweaty runs it started to break down a little. It's definitely geared more for looks than function.
3.0,Lost a loop the first week I used it love the slider fit
3.0,"I purchased both this product and another kind of water ""shoe"".  I though this one would be easier to get on due to the velcro closer.  Not true.  Was even harder to get on.  The velcro seemed to be just for looks.  My 3 year old grandson wore them once and then never wanted to put them on again."
3.0,The color is very pretty and looks good under shirts or with a tank underneath.
3.0,The skirt is beautiful but very long.  If you are under 6' you will likely have to roll it at the waist or pay a lot of money to have it shortened.  It also runs big so consider sizing down.
3.0,"He likes it and I guess that‚Äôs what matters. My 5yo with some spd asks to wear this compression shirt; he enjoys the tightness and tries to put his arms in there too. Lol.<br /><br />What I don‚Äôt like is how thick it is and the lack of detail. My little guy ends up just wearing it at home bc he gets too hot with a shirt over. The neckline, arm holes and bottom are sewn, but have the look of raw edges. It looks unfinished and sloppy. The neckline in particular has a wavy look rather than laying flat. A stretchy trim on all edges would go a long way. It doesn‚Äôt look good; when he wore it out of the house, he had to have a shirt over it buttoned up so it was covered. I won‚Äôt buy another, but may try an athletic compression shirt which could give the same feeling."
3.0,product does not look like it will hold up to regular use....  pretty disappointed
3.0,The chain is very thin and cheap..it also came with a kink in it.  The butterfly however is nice.
3.0,When I took the hair clip off it broke.  I was disappointed but thankfully my 3 year old granddaughter did not know the difference.  She loved the purse and for the price I guess what do you expect?  The purse is great and is functional I would buy it again if I had another little girl to buy it for.
3.0,not really a gold color. its just alright
3.0,Stretch out very easily.
3.0,It's true to its picture but it doesn't pop.
3.0,"They didn't last thru their first wash without a section of the trim coming off, cute- but not too sturdy."
3.0,"Material seems thin and the hat is more snug than expected. Hoping this does the trick for winter, but I have my doubts that I won't have to replace it with another product soon."
3.0,"The bands havent broken yet, but some of the fibers are peeling away from them. It should not be worn while doing rough work of any kind."
3.0,Works as it's supposed to. Keeps your shirt tucked in. But the issue I had was that the strap was digging into me and started cutting to the point where i just had to take it off halfway thru my shift.
3.0,Very tight compression sock!
3.0,Nice red. I like it.
3.0,"this was a pretty blouse, did not size appropriately.  When purchasing items it would be nice to see size<br />indicating what they consider S M , L so one knows how they figure a bust size etc for  say A medium..<br />The fabric was pretty."
3.0,Fits a little big ordered size 4 .Looks exactly like pic
3.0,"Decent hat, but heavy as straw hats go. After wearing it several times the sweatband/inside hat band the elastic is to strong and the hat rides up on your head and will pop off. The sweatband is sown horizontally not vertically. I assume this is done to cover more head sizes but  makes the hat fit sloppy work it's way up your head."
3.0,"I selected a medium, but received XXL. I am 5'8&#34; size 4, so this fits like I'm wearing my dad's shirt- which is ok, but not the fit I intended."
3.0,"These jeans look a little bit odd in person. the fit is correct for the size that I ordered, but I find The Fringe to be a little strange. It's so clear that the fringe look was not achieved in a natural-looking way, and there's something about how uniform it is that just looks off. the material for the these shorts is extremely stretchy, if you wanted to go down a size for a tight fit you could probably do so considering the extent of the give. however, I found that since these shorts were so stretchy they showed every lump and bump. These shorts do look just like the advertised photographs, so I don't find them to be misleading in any way and they might look better on someone else. I just didn't care for the quality of the material."
3.0,Black dye on beads washes away instantly. Decent quality.
3.0,These are sooooo cute!!  but they aren't true to size.  They run large.
3.0,See through! Seems more like tights. Will wear with a long tunic or skirt.
3.0,The leaves fall off with wear.
3.0,"ehhh, quality cheap."
3.0,Cute but super small. Once washed they are too tight.
3.0,A wee bit tight
3.0,I returned it. Didn't look pretty and felt cheap and was super wrinkled. I can find much better shirt dresses elsewhere.
3.0,Doesn't fit me.
3.0,"Look gaudy,"
3.0,"It's OK,looks cheap.You get what you pay for!!!"
3.0,"We replaced a 12 month old's Miraflex with these glasses. They were 1/4 of the price, so we took a chance. Not the same quality at all. We actually went back to her old scratched up ones, because this pair didn't mold her her face like the old pair we loved. These are good for an extra pair in case old pair breaks. I would not buy again."
3.0,Still bled after washing.  Ruined some sheets.  But a still a nice t-shirt.
3.0,"Like other reviewers, I received the wrong print. I received snowmen instead of Santa. I needed it for a party, so I couldn‚Äôt exchange<br />It for the right pattern. Nice fabric, nice quality."
3.0,This purse is the right size and just what I needed.  However the workmanship on it was not all that it should be.  Just carrying my phone and some loose cash and license it wasn't stressed or shouldn't have been.  But the bag tore where the strap meets the bag.  The metal plate on the closure came loose and lost a very small screw which I found very difficult to replace.
3.0,"It is a very pretty tunic, however, the fabric has very little give and is therefore not as comfortable or as soft as other tops like this one that I have.  Admittedly this could just be a preference I personally have for 'very soft' fabrics, so I was disappointed at both these issues, but not enough to return it.  It was smaller then I expected, but still fits and does look great with the leggings I purchased it to go with so I am keeping it."
3.0,"I absolurtely adore the dress, BUT it's way too small. I am a size 12 with not so big of a bust, and an XL did not fit... Like really did not get in... Such a big dissapointment! The dress is really beautiful!"
3.0,"I ordered this for grand daughter that wants to get a nose ring. It is very small, as you can see in comparison to a dime"
3.0,like glasses ordered dark lens silver frames got dark lens gold frames not what i ordered
3.0,"My wife got a sherpa from Victoria Secret and the material was insanely soft, so I wanted a sherpa for around the house. Most sherpas were priced around $30-$40 but this was only $9.59 in my size so of course I ordered it.<br />The material is nowhere near as soft as my wife's Victoria Secret sherpa. This one almost feels like wool, so it doesn't have that silky-smooth softness to it.<br />You can also see the material under the fur, similar to what you see in a super cheap floor rug. I've uploaded pictures so you can see what I'm talking about.<br />Unfortunately, mine came with a rip in the sleeve as well so I really question how long this will last. I am sending it back and getting a replacement from Amazon so hopefully the replacement is in better condition."
3.0,"Love the dress but it's too tight in the upper arms area. Also, it has no stretch what so ever. I may return it. I don't know"
3.0,"Warning: While you can fit a pair of size 11 man's shoes into these bags, I will let you know, the fit is VERY, VERY tight!  These bags are really only sized for up to men's size 9.  The bags are fairly well made, for the price."
3.0,Was much larger then expected.
3.0,These are comfortable for a good price. The medium size fit around my waist but the length was very long (designed for tall men). I may have them shortened to fit better. The flannel is very thin so you don‚Äôt overheat when sleeping.
3.0,"I love the patterns and colors, but they came way too small.  I ordered a size up and they fit tight, so I would recommend ordering two sizes up to be able to move."
3.0,I am very happy with my purchase. Better than what I thought
3.0,"Great shades, wrong size"
3.0,For extremely small wrists
3.0,"Not high quality, but you get what you think when you order it.  It looks just like the image, and is kinda freaky because it does look like an unblinking eye looking right through me.  I like it."
3.0,Smaller and thinner fabric than expected.
3.0,"Very cheap looking, would not recommend."
3.0,Very short even in a 5‚Äô2‚Äù girl. Hits two to three inches below the butt
3.0,If you normally wear a medium order a large.
3.0,This thing is cheap cheap cheap in quality.. I guess you get what you pay for. Would not order again.
3.0,peels because of heat after 4 months
3.0,"When I received this earrings , the stick part of one of the earrings was bent (check attached pics). I had to straighten it up. They are very light to wear. But the end part of earrings stick are sharp. They do not have smooth edges as a normal earring should have and can cause injury to ear while putting it on ears."
3.0,"They are pretty but, just too small for a size 7. They kept slipping off the heel which makes them completely useless for me. I had to keep taking off my shoe to pull them back in place. They are meant for a smaller foot."
3.0,"This dress is waaaaaay too long for me. I'm 5'4"" and it drags on the ground. Other than that it's cute but I would not purchase unless you're tall."
3.0,Fits foot  and calf well.  Slightly tight at the knee.  A bit expensive.
3.0,"I give this 3 stars because I still like the design. However, it's not how I expected it to be. I hat the fact that I was really looking to the pictures and assumed the third photo is what it actually looks like. But no. It's just plain inside.no pockets like the one the third photo showed. Just after I received it, that's when I realized thwat the third photo is a total different kind of wallet/bag. Why would you even confuse us like that. Not even gonna bother of returning it. Although I paid such amount of money just for a very simple product. But thanks anyways. You made a good design on the outside though."
3.0,"Pros: Beautiful dress! Vivid colors! Fantastic fit and fabric! Cons: The elastic waist does NOT sit at your waistline nor does it fit under the bustline like an Empire waist. It ends up somewhere in-between (very uncomfortable). Sadly, I returned this dress."
3.0,"One of the blue pieces fell off as soon as we pulled it out of the box, but my husband superglued it back on and it has been fine since. They serve their purpose, I just wish they were a little better quality"
3.0,"The gloves are small and just barely fit. if you feel like you have juicy fingers, you probably shouldn't go for it."
3.0,The product came in broken but it was fixed and is a cute small purse.
3.0,"Not what I expected from viewing pictures & description. Looks like all one bracelet but instead there are two bracelets. Also says fits all wrists which they don't. I usually wear about 7 3/4&#34; but this one won't stretch that far without stopping circulation at my wrist. I'll make the most of it & hang around my cars rear view mirror. My husband of 35 1/2 years has been fighting Stage 4 lung cancer for 18 months & I Love him very much, so I thought I would buy this to wear to show everyone how much I care."
3.0,"They are as cute as the cartoon.  But, they are smaller than the label size.  Also, the button holes are very large for the buttons and would need to be made smaller to keep the buttons closed.  Had to return them for being too small."
3.0,Too slim for a XL size
3.0,"This necklace is so pretty. The quality is decent, and it arrived within the designated timeframe."
3.0,Super cute. This is second pair I bought. But BOTH have fallen apart at the arm.  Poorly made
3.0,"First of all the color of this dress is just perfect. I have decided navy is the new black :)<br /><br />I usually wear an XL but wanted can fit into smaller when it is a dress. I was hopefully this would fit, but alas it did not. It fit around my lower half, but I am large breasted and that wasn't going to happen. I could be 50lbs lighter and I would not have gotten this over my front side.<br /><br />The neck is held up by this necklace type of piece. It was hard to get clasped while trying to put it on. It seemed to have a bit of a twist in it as well.<br /><br />If you are very straight up and down, not many curves, I bet this dress would look great on you.<br /><br />I got this at a discount for my honest review."
3.0,I think they are cute but way bigger than any shoe I have order. I wear thin sock so always order a 7.5. They are very loose. I got the black heel boot. I also got the knee high  brown low heel lace up the back boot in a 7 and they are too big in the shoe part but to tight in the calf I do not have big calf and my foot is measured at 23 cm and calf at 35 cm.
3.0,:I
3.0,"i didn‚Äôt receive 60 of them, and it did not include all of the colors advertised"
3.0,Not quite as nice as pictured
3.0,The lens are too big for my face. I like the style but retuned
3.0,Nice color and like the polarization. However these really are more of a wrap around sun glasses. Not my style at all. Ended up giving to my mom and she was ok with it.
3.0,"These are NOT polarized, but they are decent quality for the price. The listing title needs to be changed."
3.0,the color was a little different than pictured but great quality
3.0,Niceee!
3.0,It is good. the picture had taken in short  distance so that you can suprise when U receive it
3.0,Didn't love the fit. Not like pic.
3.0,"I was disappointed with the size.  I really love these dresses that I ordered 3 different colors. However, they were too small and I have to give them away. How sad!"
3.0,I love it but the material is a thinner that I expected but my son loves it
3.0,DAUGHTER LIKED THEM
3.0,ordered and received my product just fine. the chain was rather short though and did not fit
3.0,"Cute style, but runs large, particularly the top. The top halter straps tie so you can adjust that part, but the top itself was so big it just hung off my back. Material is thin/cheap."
3.0,"The purse is nice looking and of good quality, but difficult to zip and unzip. I won‚Äôt use it on any regular basis because of that design flaw."
3.0,"I like the fit and style, but I'm not so sure about the ""polarized"" lens it mentions in the description.  I could not tell the difference between the glasses and without them when looking at the water while fishing recently."
3.0,"Be careful when ordering. I ordered Medium which is what I get in other watch bands, but their medium is small"
3.0,18 of the 40 I received did not work. I only gave a 3 rating because the ones that did work were a huge hit at my sons birthday party.
3.0,"Cute & stylish, would have given 4 stars, but they fall off very easily."
3.0,"We bought two of these and one worked good and is easily recharged. The other one worked just as well, but the battery no longer charges, and this was after very limited use. So, buyer beware the overall battery recharging life may be limited. Other than that I liked it, it works well."
3.0,I am not sure how to rate this swimsuit. I ordered a size or two larger. I am returning it. I liked the extra room but was too large for me at the mid drift.  It is a cute suit but fell too low at the back and showed to much for me (probably because I ordered too large).
3.0,This is soo besutiful!  The only thing is i wore it one night and i lost soo many sequin...im afraid after a few wears it will be large gaps in it.
3.0,"I wear a small and bought a medium, it was a little tight at the bust. I wish the hem and sleeves were little longer!"
3.0,"The purse looks bigger in the pictures than in real life, can't fit much in there after I have my wallet and sunglasses in there. The wallet it comes with also doesn't have a place to store coins so useless for me. The look and quality of the purse is nice though but if you're wanting a bigger purse to store more than a wallet and some glasses then this is not the purse for you."
3.0,These run small but have stretched some after wearing.
3.0,The poles had to be glued into place to keep them from falling over and to level the cross rods.
3.0,Cute but cheap made. The top was a little big also!
3.0,"These are Super cute and fit well, however I wouldn‚Äôt recommended working out in them. While they are not see through, they show all sweat marks. I am keeping these for leisure wear and enjoy them cause they are cute and fit well."
3.0,"Looks really cute, but sparkle is not part of the fabric. It's a glitter that sheds. Also, fabric is a drop scratchy. (I'm sensitive.) Fit is a bit loose, I have a medium head."
3.0,Biggest XL I've ever owned
3.0,"Mine arrived intact and it is pretty. Not as pretty as the one pictured, mine has more yellow in it."
3.0,It's s cute. It's literally half the size of a bobby pin. $15 seems a little steep for something like that.
3.0,"Jeans are nice, great jean, only they are larger than what they are sized. Or at least the pair I got was.  item was returned."
3.0,Nice but the color did fade after week of wear
3.0,Definitely not a compression shirt. Fits like a regular undershirt. Not what I thought but still nice and useful
3.0,It‚Äôs a nice dress for the occasion I needed it for. It fits good. I ordered the small. I‚Äôm short at 5‚Äô2‚Äù weight at 108 lbs. 22 years old. Except the cleavage is too low. (I have slight big breasts for my height) and the length fell right under my knees which I don‚Äôt like. I like my short dresses to be above my knees and my long dresses to be touching the floor. Overall I like the material. It‚Äôs a nice purple. I got compliments from it!
3.0,"I really liked these until I rode in them. I tried several times but they just never felt comfortable. The fit was fine but the material was odd. Not as stretchy as I'd expected, stiff and felt awkward."
3.0,"Let‚Äôs start with  sizing, I ordered an XL, according to size chart , thinking I was giving myself more space, as I usually wear a 12/14, but it was way tighter than I‚Äôm comfortable with. It shows every bump and bulge, even with shape wear. I‚Äôve ordered online dresses before, especially with stretch, and it‚Äôs usually more forgiving.  It‚Äôs is stretchy, but not flattering. The fabric feels kind of stiff, but good for a colder weather evening, as it‚Äôs not see-through at all.<br /><br />The shape is lovely for those willing to show curves, and the color is on par. I like the rouching and side details, but disappointing that I‚Äôll need to drop a few LBs. to get into this dress comfortably."
3.0,Pretty design. I just don't like the look of the silver nowadays. Very shiny metal looking silver. Almost makes me want to spend less and buy stainless steel.  I miss the soft whitish color of my silver from years back.
3.0,"Just returned two pairs. Quality looked decent, but the frames had no bend in them. My 3yo has a round but flat face (small nose) and the glasses wouldn‚Äôt stay on his face. We‚Äôre bought several other brands from Amazon but saw the reviews and colors available so decided to try these. I‚Äôm sure they can work well for others but not good for little noses.<br /><br />Also strangely when I took them to the UPS store, Amazon required me to pre-package one but they other didn‚Äôt require it. I bought both at the same time (red lens and a blue lens), returned them in the original packaging,  it I was required to buy a packing envelope for the blue one. It was under $2, but still. Was a little irritated by that, especially since it‚Äôs advertised to just drop off in original packing and UPS packs for the customer."
3.0,After one wash they unraveled  but it is soft and comfy
3.0,The only reason I am giving it a lower rating is because it makes my wrist really sweaty. I don't like that but other then tht fact it is super soft and comfy. I do fall asleep with it on sometimes and it isn't uncomfortable.
3.0,"I don‚Äôt know what to think about these high waisted yoga pants‚Ä¶. They have some weird markings on the back and sides. They are soft but not your typical buttery soft yoga pants we are all familiar with. There aren‚Äôt any pockets which is always a downside for me. I ordered a medium and they fit fine. I am 140lbs, size 6 pants and 5‚Äù4‚Äô."
3.0,I ordered this hoodie or more like a sweatshirt gor 29 dollars was expecting more from russell first off was thinner than expected and too long its ok to wear around the house nothing more i should have stayed with champion
3.0,The handle comes up way to far and makes it look obnoxious when pulling it.  We returned ours right away.  Just not right.
3.0,But I gave it to someone who could use it.
3.0,Cushy FABRIC straps with plastic hardware. Good deal but false advertsing.
3.0,"This is a cute little coat. However, the fleece is cheap - almost felt like. I felt like it could pill easily. It also was very thin. It is definitely a coat for show and not to keep a little one warm. In the end, it wouldn't work for the purpose intended, so I returned it. But for photos, light wear, this would be a good buy for someone if you take the nature of the article into consideration."
3.0,It fits but does not prevent cold at all.
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed with this dress, not because of the fit, fabric or print. I ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly, but I kept trying this dress on to see what it looked on me. Answer awful, and I don‚Äôt know why. But I persisted and today thought to wear it as a top over wide leg pants and over a gray tank top et voila looks good. I can‚Äôt really tell you why, but as a dress, from the waist down made me look kind of dumpy. Love the print and comfortable fabric content."
3.0,"Color is great, but very small"
3.0,I thought it was more than 1 set.
3.0,very nice but not true size
3.0,These enabled me to wear costume jewelry without an allergic reaction. But one set of earrings- I placed the back stopper on the prong not realizing that as I did so it pushed up on the plastic sleeve causing it to split open part of the way. So when it was time to take my earrings off the sleeves acted almost like a wall anchor- it was painful to pull them out. Just wanted to warn others when putting the backing on your earrings to be careful not to push it too far.
3.0,Huge!  I felt like I was wearing a parachute.  Way too long. - maybe good for a tall person.
3.0,The material is pretty thin but the dress is cute.
3.0,Love this necklace. Arrive fast and fits perfect
3.0,Huge but lightweight. Should have returned. Too big.
3.0,"Although very pretty, it started tarnishing only after a couple of wear. For the price paid, I did not expect it to tarnish. The bracelet is very pretty."
3.0,Buy one size bigger since the fabric doesn‚Äôt really stretch.
3.0,The orange color in the picture is different from what it really is.
3.0,It is a bit large but looks cute.The material is like thermal and there is extra material on the back of the inside of the strap which i thought should not be there.
3.0,Will have to do s number of adjustments. Was big. And I ordered my size
3.0,"I bought an XL and it's still a little too small. I'm hoping to lose some weight, so I can wear it in the Fall.  I'm about 5'6 and 170 lbs.<br />It's a bit difficult to put on. You have to first unbutton the front, then unzip the back, then put it over your head. That's a lot more work than most dresses.  Also, the skirt is a very stiff, somewhat heavy material. I will need to iron it. It's pretty, though."
3.0,"It's difficult to tell in the picture, but the way the closure is sewn at the chest is slightly diagonal, so the button line looks crooked. If it was a bit more purposeful, like completely angled, say 45 degrees, it would look cute, but it just looks poorly sewn.<br /><br />The material is quite thick and stiff. I would wear this in the winter, but it is much to hot for summer or even spring.<br /><br />Because the material is hefty and doesn't flow well, there is quite a bit of bunching for me at the armpits between my shoulders and the sides of the bodice. I have a large chest, so I accept that this is part of the reason this happens, but the material isn't very forgiving in this area.<br /><br />I'm also rather curvy in the hips. I am 5'7"" and 185lbs. This dress held onto my bottom as I moved, but it may loosen a bit when I sit in it for the first time.<br /><br />They should work on the description a bit so that the consumer really knows what they're getting. The pictures are misleading.<br /><br />It's good enough to keep."
3.0,The back is see- through.
3.0,"The green ones Fit well and I love them. The grey ones have no stretch and are for a much shorter person. I can‚Äôt pull them up, and have sent them to goodwill after 2 attempted uses."
3.0,Pocket on shirt to small to hold ink pin or glasses .
3.0,"Too small, waist tie cheap (I pulled it out), material in shorts not bad."
3.0,"The product is made well, but does not hold the hats in place they fall out easily, but I will say when I went to return them they wanted to charge me for shipping, but then the sellers made it right and gave me a full refund. thanks for great customer service it matters!"
3.0,"Cute, but not durable for an athlete."
3.0,"Neat! Fabric is Halloween costume type material and the neck is way too big for me, but I'm really thin. For the price I'm not complaining."
3.0,It's ok not for my husband!
3.0,Had to return it because it's way to big for a child.  Don't really know how well it works because I didn't try it.  I could see it would not fit a normal size 8 year old.
3.0,Beautiful earrings but tarnish very fast!
3.0,Ordered for my 6 month old niece. They were way too big.
3.0,"I have three colors in this dress  Navy, Black and Green.  The Olive green is a bit snug"
3.0,"I gave it 3 stars because i ordered a 3x and was sent an xl. It mostly fit, despite being a smaller size. It was tight in the bust but other than that its okay. The print is really cute and the fabric is nice!"
3.0,I thought this would be a better quality
3.0,I love this set as did the other person I ordered one for. The issue is the earrings are unable to be worn due to the posts being so big.
3.0,"Nice enough, but was smaller than expected even after ordering up a size"
3.0,"Decent, not amazing. The extra large size is quite large, especially on the inserts. This XLarge fits larger than Carhartt or Wells or Mechanix XLarge gloves do. I'd say these keep me decently warm in 30-40 F weather but were not enough when it gets below 20."
3.0,It‚Äôs smaller than a size 12 in girls fits more like a 7/8 or  a 9/10
3.0,Pretty but smaller than normal size
3.0,"Will change if replacement ,is true go size. Iam currently able go were size 6 to 9 jeans , and small to large and in some cases xlarge(pending cut of items, and bust area) That all said The bottom portion of the dress fits perfectly , however the top is extremly loose and should be considered xxx not xlarge , not true to size as I am 125 lbs 5'4 with 36d bust, I bought alittle big due to my as every womens does can do what it wants pending time of montb and hornones so gave bit of room todo let the girlz do their thing. However to much room in this case. Ill wait to pass full judge me for replacement arrival and try on. Pretty , feels light weight and comfy other wise. Will need a slip def or what undef shirt and undies if you prefef."
3.0,When I first got the necklace it looked too short but then I realized it was expandable.  Seems a bit flimsy but is still wearable for what I need.
3.0,"Top fits small, short in length, but bottoms run large. Hard to size a kiddo in something like that. Otherwise, cute, looks like the ad."
3.0,Size 10M US definitely fits like a size 9 US sizes. They try to say it's size 9 UK and size 10 US ... but my child's feet and large-ish shoe collection say otherwise. I get the feeling they are measuring based on the length of the sole and forgetting to account for the amount of padding inside the slipper which makes it reduce by about 1 size.<br /><br />3 stars because it's an adorable little slipper and easily put on by herself. hopefully she will get a couple months out of them
3.0,"Really comfy workout leggings, they fit great,  and I suggest getting your regular size.<br />Downside though- they're see through! I'll just wear some shorts under them or wear a long shirt and I'll be fine"
3.0,These are pretty abalone earrings but very very small. MUCH tinier than advertised.
3.0,"I gave a 3 star because I‚Äôve had it a few months now & it‚Äôs running the color off in a few places, the gold hardware is even Turing a different color.  Over all I like it though."
3.0,Little cheap but overall okay
3.0,Is very nice looking but finding it difficult to arrange keys on it so they move easily.
3.0,Very cute shirt but the fit was too small. The fabric isn't very stretchy. Size up if you buy this shirt
3.0,"These seemed well-made, and were comfortable, but the super-wide legs just didn't work on me (I'm short and don't have very slender ankles). If I found another style that suited me better, I would buy from this company again. I love to find 100% cotton clothing."
3.0,"This is not nearly as sheer as the picture would lead you to believe, which made it unsuitable for my purpose.<br /><br />It s definitely very casual. The edges were finished well and it fit me (I wear a US 20-22) so that was great. Not what I wanted though."
3.0,"Fading in the back,already"
3.0,My daughter loved the costume but  after the 1st wearing (1 hr around the house) it already had its 1st visible hole. The stitching is subpar and missed sections of some layers. By the 2nd wear we were at 2 holes and by the 3rd wear we had to retire it...
3.0,The only thing I like about this one is the back desing other than that it made out low quality material
3.0,Received bag quickly. I ordered the blue bag with brown strap. Item came & it was all blue. Doesn't look like the picture. Plus the smell is horrible. Was way smaller than I expected as well. Going to return it for a refund.
3.0,My grandson loved it.  But it broke in 2 weeks.
3.0,"We purchased this for my 9 month old son and while he enjoys it immensely, I don't have great hope for it in the long term. First off, never leave your child unattended in this because it is incredibly wobbly and has been known to skid across the lawn with the motion of swinging. The seat is nice and sturdy, but in terms of adjusting with age, it will meet the end of it's useful life before my son grows into the next stage because the frame is so short that a toddler couldn't comfortably swing without dragging their feet on the ground.<br /><br />For the price, it's worth the few hours of diversion it's brought us so far, but it was a poor purchase for long term use."
3.0,DID NOT FIT WELLAT ALL..RETURNEDSOOJUN OVERS
3.0,The color and quality seemed decent enough butt it had much smaller Cups than I expected and was much lower cut! It made a skinny girl with tiny breast look like she was dangling whatever cleavage she could everywhere not so good can't wear in public:(
3.0,Small for boobs
3.0,Fabric is slick. Too clingy. The cut is great
3.0,"It's okay, very small and cheap looking."
3.0,"It looks funny, like the end of the hoop barely goes to the end/inside of my nostril."
3.0,I brought  a medium  and feels like it's small size up. It is thin have to wear a hoodie with it. Cute colors.
3.0,Bought these to replace the sport band. These are not adjustable for smaller wrists.
3.0,"Wasn‚Äôt impressed, sent It back."
3.0,Arrived smushed
3.0,The lace on the sleeves was very tight
3.0,"Product works well so far, but it took 2 months to arrive."
3.0,Darker yellow than it appeared in pictures. Looked more gold in person. Didn't use it.
3.0,The fabric is pretty stiff.
3.0,being someone with 2 heads finding 2 packs of hats is a pain. Theses are of a good material but both of my heads are the same size (well pretty close) so it sucks these are not the same size.
3.0,I love the style but the clasp was stuck and i had to replace it myself.
3.0,As cute as this shirt is the trouble I had getting it delivered ruined much of the satisfaction with it.
3.0,"This was adorable and fit my granddaughter perfectly. Unfortunately, the first time I washed it the blue bottoms became gray bottoms. The top and skirt colors remained true. She wears the skirt so the pants don't bother her at all, but still . . ."
3.0,cute bikini.... but the bottoms were WAY too big.
3.0,Not even close to the right size. I ordered a 2XL and it's way too small
3.0,"For the price this is a great product. I am 5.2 and weight 130 pounds and it fit relatively well, there is some gapping in the back and it doesn't cover my boobs as well as I'd like... but my husband loved it so I guess that's all that matters!"
3.0,"Ha, I love this model picture... You know her hands are behind her back pulling this shirt tight, don't you? The top is a little tight anyway but isn't too bad."
3.0,It's falling apart after wearing it less than 10 times. Cheaply made
3.0,"These socks appear to be of good quality (they're sick material not stocking material), but they are not going to work with regular flats. My loafers cover more of my feet than my flats do but these socks still show. Keep that in mind when buying."
3.0,"Fabric is nice, seems and cut are flattering, color is as pictured‚Ä¶really all great. Except my standard medium didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôd recommend sizing up"
3.0,"My wife likes it. Fits as expected, although a little tight. Has a tendency to flatten the breasts, with the padded cups."
3.0,"Not much compression.  Wish they were a bit tighter, but they are really cute"
3.0,"I have ordered glasses from this company before and have always absolutely loved them! They offer good quality products! I just was not feeling the glasses this time. I knew they were plastic but the super lightweight matte plastic rims did not seem to mesh well with the gold edging. They looked odd on my face, they may just not be a good fit for my face shape and size. They are absolutely gorgeous just not for me! I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review, it in no way affected my opinion of the product."
3.0,"Unflattering if you have any type of belly ""bulge."" Ruching isn't around belly/waist as much as it looks in the pics."
3.0,"Way smaller than a ""regular"" one size. I am 160 lbs. I could get them on and not move. I emailed and they said they will refund money."
3.0,"the place were you are to put your credits cards is not wide enough for the cards , the outer part is really nice ....."
3.0,I like everything but the zippered part for the money u can‚Äôt even get ur fingers in there to get the money out a very poor design
3.0,"I‚Äôve ordered the gray dress like this one that l love it so much, this one is nothing like the gray one that l love. The fit is way off it‚Äôs not soft as the other. The material is not the same seems like a knock off. Still ok so I‚Äôm giving 3 stars instead of 5 because I don‚Äôt love it."
3.0,Super quick delivery but very big for the size I chose.
3.0,Feels cheep not worth the $$
3.0,"Todo est√° bien hecho, y te sientes como princesa. Solo checar bien las medidas, yo compro siempre 16 y este no me cerro ni cercas üòî y me pesa mucho."
3.0,The shirt is paper thin and very snug. I ordered the size large and it fits snug. I normally wear a medium.
3.0,This ring had a bad catch in the inside of ring so I had to file it. It scratch my figure while wearing it
3.0,Just came in today so I haven‚Äôt worn them but they have a very strong chemical smell.  I will wash and let them air out and hopefully the smell will be gone so I can try them out.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f105fea06f464035f86d4fef86bd27]] I have to say it‚Äôs amazing! I received it just 20 minutes ago (Jan 4, 2019) and it took a while in shipping but opening it and finding this watch so cool! Been looking for something steampunk watches and I can see a few gears moving (top and bottom are just covering up the gears, probably to support the skeleton). The numerals are very hard to see when in dark or with bad lightning. Would definitely wear it in broad daylight or try to get the one that‚Äôs not black!<br />I have a very small wrist but the last hole near the watch saved me lol... it‚Äôs fit and comfy.<br />For the manually mechanical gear, it can be a bit annoying but kinda nice to see time moving again. Just make sure you set the time and push the button. Then you can turn it to make the gears move!<br />In the photo and video, you can see why I have to use flash on my phone so you can see clearly and bright.<br />Thank you, will be using it in the future.<br /><br />Edit: It only had been literally two days since I bought it and it stopped working. I had to bang it and shake it to get it to work (soft areas only). Probably not a good idea to get this if you‚Äôre planning to turn the wheel constantly so it won‚Äôt lose time..."
3.0,"My granddaughter normally wear a 3T, I bought size 3/4. The top and bottom are a little big but the mermaid skirt is extremely too long."
3.0,Very lite weight not very sturdy
3.0,They smell weird
3.0,"I ordered it 2 sizes bigger and it was very very fitted. I loved the color and bow, but just didn't like the fit."
3.0,"They fit well, however, I don't like the elastic band around the waist. I would have liked it to be spandex or something similar. The band shows through some of my thinner tops."
3.0,"If you're not used to wearing earrings, the swirl lollipop is slightly heavy. Not super duper heavy, but over time, you start to feel it. I only wanted to keep the swirly lollipops because the gummy bears are so hideous and looks nothing like a gummy bear. It wasn't worth keeping the whole set, so I returned it. The earrings came in individually packaged, which I appreciated!"
3.0,"This sounded like a wonderful idea, but am not sure that it is working for me as well as it should"
3.0,these rings are very small. they make them look big in the pic but they are disappointing in person
3.0,"I am typically about a size 4 so I bought a small. It looks really baggy on me. I‚Äôm returning this as I will never wear it, too frumpy for me."
3.0,Super cute love these shoes for my son but they fit like a size 5 when I bought a size 7 so they won't be lasting long for us
3.0,"Ordered 3 of these (different colors) and found inconsistencies between all three. Different pocket sizes, different collar lengths, even found some random incorrect fabric threads (1 - 3 threads red on the blue and white in the black). Overall quality was ok, but not worth the price."
3.0,"you used pressed plywood on this and it came apart , you should of used good wood for what you charge for this item disappointed if you like a picture i be happy to send to you ,,,"
3.0,Hubiera preferido que indicaran que no es un producto original
3.0,They worked for a little while. They do leak faster. They didnt give any rashes. They was easy to use. Worked for what i needed. My son hated diapers since he was 10 months.
3.0,"The sizes of the shades were a bit too small, like they were made for children. Also the frame color was more rose gold colored rather than gold or silver. Only one pair was silver. Only one pair was gold. Not at all what I was expecting."
3.0,I loved the color but not the price. I needed outfits just to throw on to wear around the house or if have to run out. Didn't want this material but could not find in Cotton. Wore twice in the summer put dont think it will last over time. I think this is really over priced.
3.0,Fit but there is not a lot of chest support.  I maybe could have sized down but then I wouldn't have gotten the length.  I am 5'6&#34; and 142 lb. and I ordered a M.
3.0,"I thought this was a watch with the band, I did not know it was not a watch.  I do not have an apple watch.  So this band was a waste of money and no use for me.  If I could find a cheap watch that fits this band I will buy one, but I think that is impossible, the band match some clothes I have.  I sure won't make this mistake again."
3.0,"I really like the sling design of this camera strap.  Unfortunately, after a year of very limited use, the metal part tore out of the nylon strap, and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it.  I'm totally bummed."
3.0,Easily breakable
3.0,"My daughter loves Elmo, so she loves this bedding set. I was disappointed that the pillowcase I received is solid red, not printed like the picture. I washed the whole set with cold water on delicate cycle. The red still ran, and turned the white background of the printed sheets pink, the colors did fade quite a bit, the fabric is not as soft as I had hoped... but my daughter still loves them, so I guess that's the most important thing!"
3.0,"Overpriced.  Had to trim off quite a few loose threads.  The fit is good.  Washed up well, following the directions."
3.0,"Zipper is metal and hard to operate. For the money, expect only a short life span."
3.0,"Es util, c√≥modo y bonito el dise√±o! Solo que la talla que pedi me quedo grande. Sin embargo lo puedo usar."
3.0,"The top part for nursing is fantastic, but overall the dress felt very frumpy. I was looking for something to wear out during the summer that could also be breastfeeding friendly but I think this is more suited for comfy ‚Äúaround the house‚Äù wearing."
3.0,"Not particularly easy on/off especially if real size is toward the XL end and if body flexibility is not excellent. Once on, support and comfort are very good."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:fc43eeab284bc9605cab29221dbefede]] No es exactamente lo que espera pens√© que eran de mejor material y m√°s peque√±o no es que estoy insatisfecha solo que no fue lo que esperaba
3.0,"Compared to a popular brand that is more costly you can tell the difference.  So based on this price point, quantity and material it is aligned properly.  Stretchy so big head friendly.  I'm not disappointed with this purchase."
3.0,"I have to say that I  bought a pack of socks from this brand  as a  lightning deal about a year  ago, and they  have held up SO well! I was really surprised at how  much I liked the fit, and  how well they  have  washed and  worn. I decided to buy another pack, and  went with these more white  colored socks. This pack was NOT 'cushioned' at all, and  you can see  right through the tops of them. They  are definitely not what I would consider an athletic sock, they are a  basic, white sock with stripes on them - pretty much what  I expected the other pack to be when I got them. My advice is to go with their other socks - that have more cushioning in them and are a thicker  material."
3.0,Attractive watches. Gave 3 stars because for me face too big. One of the little strips of &#34;leather&#34; fell off while trying to put on.  Ordered smaller face Timex. Going to give to me teenager. Seems more for them. I need more professional look.
3.0,"These feel great on, but slide down."
3.0,se ven esteticamente bien pero no son comodas no tienen mucho algodon
3.0,"As seems to be the trend in men's briefs currently, these fit about an inch below the natural waistline. I like mine at least at the waist line. Material seems good and stitching is likewise."
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty and are the perfect size but one of them was missing the back that holds the eating on. That was a little disappointing, but other than that, they are exactly what I was hoping for."
3.0,Took over a month to arrive‚Ä¶ forgot all about the thing bc it took so long.
3.0,I'm guessing it is fragile enough to not wear while being active.
3.0,"nice color, seems to run small.. clingy material , glad I ordered larger than I usually would"
3.0,Nice for a child 10 and under.
3.0,"These earrings look good, like the pictures, but they're small hoops, not really huggies, at least to me.  I consider earrings huggies if they really hug the earlobe with little space between the earlobe and the earring"
3.0,I bought about two weeks ago and my pocket is already ripping away from the sweatshirt but other than that it's fine
3.0,These gauges are beautiful and fit nicely. The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because I only received 14 unique pairs 2 pairs were duplicates.
3.0,"Adorable tunic dress, fit great up top- but too big from waist down. Too much material at waist line so gathered and did not lay smoothly."
3.0,They were to big at first but fit perfect know
3.0,"I bought this for my son who is a huge Fallout fan.  The wallet itself looks really nice and feels good.  The only complaint I would mention about this is that the card slots are too tight.  He only holds one card, so it isn't a deal-breaker.  However, if I had purchased this for myself, I would've probably returned it based on that alone.  So only one complaint, but to me it's a biggie."
3.0,Sadly the zipper on this wallet is very cheap. I spend a good 10 mins sometimes just trying to get the wallet unzipped. It's super frustrating when you're in a line or need to access something from your wallet in a hurry. I would of sent it back however my window to return has pasted. Those are the ropes sometimes.
3.0,Very cute but in less than a week the his queen chain broke off and it got lost. Very nice looking but not very sturdy
3.0,Very different color than I expected
3.0,"Yanno I thought the pants would be more  narrow towards the bottom, like leggings. When you look at the description the model seems to have on a legging type fit. Let's keep it üíØ if you showing us this clothing! ITS NOT A TAPERED FIT PEOPLE!!"
3.0,Nice quality but runs kinda small
3.0,The color is not light blue... it is more like a like green.  Good quality but size is smaller than description says.
3.0,The graphic seems to be mediocre quality. As if someone had used a cricut to put it on. Not sure how it will hold up in the wash. The hoodie itself is more of a tshirt material/weight. Definitely not as warm or thick as a hoodie. I got it for a 8 year old for his birthday so I'm sure he is going to love it anyway. I just hope the graphic on the front doesn't come off in the washer.
3.0,Came crooked
3.0,I really liked these until the clasp on the smaller size hoop just stopped clicking into place. I haven‚Äôt had issues with any of the other pairs and I really like the
3.0,WORTH THE PRICE
3.0,"The material itself is comfortable and stretchy. The colors and the design were also beautiful. The cut out for the neck was larger than I would have liked, which did let some cold air in. The chest and sleeves are also bigger. I am 5'4"" and 250 lbs. I ordered the 3X. If I were going to order another one, I would have opted for a XL."
3.0,"I ordered a XL for a larger fit. I currently wear a medium. Robe is made of great material and feels great against my skin. However, the xl fits like a medium."
3.0,Great quality. Beautiful colors. But they slip continuously off my head.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:a0bfb377661fddcef48615d23c2dc18f]] I loved it when I first got it! My hair fit and it was really comfortable. But then I waahed it, like I do EVERYTHING I order off of the internet and it faded like I had had it for 2 years!! I was shocked! The color of the stitches in my video WAS the color of the bonnet! Sucks because I was so excited about it."
3.0,"I thought I was getting three pair of glasses, received one pair. They are nice but I was hoping to have a pair for each space in my home where I have a computer and one pair for the road.  Other than that, I like them!"
3.0,"I typically wear 18W/1X/2X/XXL in US women's sizes. I ordered a size M, which I think was the recommended unisex size. The arms are too tight for me. Maybe they are supposed to be more like compression sleeves, but I don't care for that. What makes it worse is that the sleeves are way too long. If the length fit me, I could probably deal with the compression.<br /><br />Another issue is all of the logos everywhere: on the sleeves and on the back. I don't like being a walking billboard for companies.<br /><br />This shrug feels well made. The material is thin and slightly sheer, but you don't want anything too thick for summer."
3.0,"3 stars cause I bought these as a gift for my brother. He had to swap out the soul of the shoe, because that wasn‚Äôt comfortable. The boots felt really light but in only three months the bottom of the shoe fell off."
3.0,Neat umbrella fits in bag easily. A bit small but ok.
3.0,Works so so. Not easy
3.0,To big in the chest
3.0,The outfit is super cute and comfy. However it's really big. I read the other reviews that said it fit large but ordered anyways so fool on me. I'm just gonna let baby boy grow into it because other than the size issue I love it.
3.0,More red than maroon. And shorter than I thought it would be. I prefer my shirts a little longer. This hit top of my jeans.
3.0,"Pros: Soft, stretchy material. Decent fit.<br /><br />Cons: A little snug. (I order a lot of Allegra K, I know to size way up) The &#34;pockets&#34; are oddly sewn and HORRIBLY placed! If you aren't a &#34;twig&#34; they will hit you at the most unflattering places and they are impossible to lay flat.<br /><br />I am 5'7 220 lbs and the largest size fits &#34;okay&#34; Overall I am pleased with the item. Just not a fan of those dang &#34;pockets&#34;"
3.0,Cute fit. Stretchy. Just thin material. The pants were longer than what I needed so it came over by navel. It gave a little
3.0,"Not as stretchy as I'd like it to be so it makes it hard to pull on over the calf area,  and I'm not a big gal. Just ok for me. I bought the black nurse mates ekg style and wear those all the time;  much more comfortable!"
3.0,Very small. A little too small
3.0,The dress material is very thin and the dress itself has no form to it unless the drawstring or a belt is used. Beautiful colors though.
3.0,Cheaply made. Not wide enough.
3.0,"I liked how it looked on my butt and thighs, but not at waist. It runs small, but it is stretchy. I‚Äôll just return it, because the rips were bigger than i expected. For reference, im 5‚Äô7 155 lbs and waist circumference is 32inch"
3.0,The clasp comes undone too easily and the bracelet falls off my wrist.
3.0,Not super great quality!
3.0,Gigantic. just not for me. Very pretty but not for me at all. Looks like big church jewelry.
3.0,"The shirt fits, but not like the model is demonstrating. It is shorter and more form-fitting. Looks good."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but the material was just too thin to wear without something underneath. The quality felt very cheap and I just couldn‚Äôt keep it. Others mentioned a thicker material that you couldn‚Äôt see through. That isn‚Äôt what I received."
3.0,Class broke easily after wearing for a few hours
3.0,Photo does not show that there is a star stud and stitching at the edge of the belt that is rolled up. Makes it look very ‚Äúcowgirl.‚Äù
3.0,"Looks like they'd be great, other than the fact that I ordered an extra large for my husband and received a Medium, he can barely squeeze his hands in them...now we're going to have to return them for a larger size"
3.0,"Nice, but they sent me wrong size"
3.0,"It was a good value,  however,  one of the prongs on the middle stone were not all the way down."
3.0,"3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è Super comfy, but not overly stretchy.  Not particularly soft either. Size up to wear as a coverup or if you want it comfy loose."
3.0,"Despite reading the description and following the size guide, I've found that it's quite off.  This is a China made product, so of course I hoped for the best, but it doesn't quite drape on me the way the display pictures show.  I'm 5'5&#34; and 150 lbs, quite average and this shirt is fairly tight on me.  However, it has been a decent work out shirt and is thin enough to allow quite a bit of breathing room.  The peach-pink color is pretty, but it is a little see through.  All in all, I wouldn't purchase this shirt again, knowing what I know, now. I'd like to thank the seller for allowing me to purchase this shirt at a reduced cost so that I could share my honest review."
3.0,"It's cute,, but if you have any sensitivity to metal jewelry, this will break you out in a rash. I cannot wear."
3.0,They seem to run large.
3.0,not a choker & the metal is probably gonna irritate my skin but the eye looks really awesome lol
3.0,"Boxy cut but otherwise This bird shirt is üî•üî•. It brings so much heat all the suave a man could wish for. But I have another SSLR shirt that had a much more fitting slim cut this one is a boxy, but wearable mostly because the birds are lume AF. Figured getting this on the same size as my other SSLR would be safe I was wrong"
3.0,"Too small - not enough room to hold passport, credit cards, tickets, etc"
3.0,Pretty design but very cheap looking
3.0,I would normally buy a medium for yoga pants  but these don't seem to have as much spandex as I am used to so they bag on me.  They are fine for hanging around but don't think I will purchase again.
3.0,"Ordered medium and while it stretches, the fit is very tight to the point that if it's hot, you will not be able to pull it over your head and arms.  I'm a 36D and wear small to medium tops depending upon the cut.  This felt like it should have been tagged small, so order a large if you want some room."
3.0,"For those wondering about the fit: My palms are 3.5‚Äù in width, my hands (from start of wrist to end of middle finger) are 7.5‚Äù long, and my wrists are 6.5‚Äù-7‚Äù in circumference. The gloves had room to spare in all directions, and the wrist band was slightly loose on me. Big enough that the paw pad shifted around a little, but not too big to be impractical.<br /><br />These gloves are cute and look exactly like the picture, and very well made; the paw pads are embroidered and the fabric seems sturdy. A major issue, though, is that the wristband is very uncomfortable. The material is stiff and scratchy, with little elasticity, so if you have larger wrists than me they‚Äôd be too tight. I had to return them because I bought them for a cosplay and they‚Äôd be way too uncomfortable to wear all day.<br /><br />I also wish the wristband was a different color, like maybe covered in fleece the same color as the fur, but that‚Äôs a matter of taste."
3.0,"Just too tight at the waistband and hurt, even though it was the right size for my hips.  Nice material and would have kept these if it had been comfortable for my waist."
3.0,Swimsuit is cute but the bottoms were too small for me so I only wear the top
3.0,It was pretty difficult to get on and get a good fit. And then it ripped ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
3.0,"Whelp... umm... so there‚Äôs no way in heck this could even be thought of as a dress. It‚Äôs a shirt. Period, end of story. Doesn‚Äôt even think about covering your crotch. I got the red which is for sure more of a peachy orange. Not in love. And the fabric is thick but supremely wrinklable. I steamed it flat and it wrinkled within five minutes of putting it on. Shame on the color and the wrinkly fabric, as as a shirt I like the cut..."
3.0,way too thin.
3.0,They work but aren‚Äôt comfortable and look like cataract glasses.
3.0,Cute dress. TTS but I would size up if you have a larger bust. Dress is NOT fully lined. The decorative parts down the middle and around the waist are completely see through. No fabric under those areas at all. Makes it impossible to wear a bra with it.
3.0,They are cute but‚Ä¶..the toe grip/stop is too far back on the thong so the heal is too short. Wish I would have ordered 2 sizes larger!!
3.0,"Clothing was in a ripped plastic bag, unzipped, and wrinkled.  Pretty sure this was a return.  The material sits weirdly on the shoulders, a little less so with a shirt underneath.  Adequate, I guess."
3.0,I like this product and the price was good .
3.0,"Came quickly and delivered as indicated online.  Was slightly undersized, so I switched it to another pair of less worn shoes and all was well.  The sizing error was probably my fault"
3.0,It‚Äôs sexy. Have a body you love because it will grip you in the right places.
3.0,its hard to adjust the links. it came to fit a mans wrist
3.0,It's cute but not as red as I'd like it to be- more pink color
3.0,"Needed to switch to longer shoelaces otherwise my daughters feet kept slipping out. She's usually a 10, had to get one size down."
3.0,looks better on pic when you get it looks cheep
3.0,Nice Jacket way too small.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt last long it broke easily.
3.0,"Ordered this case for my husband because he is a dallas fan and after having it for a couple of months its already cracked, and it doesnt seem to have much around the edge of it where the screen is... I feel like if the phone was dropped especially on the ground screen first it would still crack the screen cause as stated its not much around the edges"
3.0,pretty but  a litte snug
3.0,It‚Äôs so pretty but it doesn‚Äôt sit well on your neck. It‚Äôs awkward.
3.0,Looks just like the pictures but is smaller then I thought order a size up!
3.0,Okay not great
3.0,Dislike.  Wasn't what ir appeared
3.0,"Although this vest is much more realistic than a typical commercial costume piece, there were a few issues. It's a little longer than it's supposed to be but otherwise was sized reasonably close to the described sizing. The vest was really stringy though, and I had to cut hanging threads off of nearly every seam. I worried I would actually cut a seam so I had to leave some threads hanging."
3.0,Product was to small for 10 year old.
3.0,"Thought this was an average sized over the shoulder back pack for my son for school but it's not, it's tiny! Good for hiking or small things."
3.0,Very thin so it won't keep you warm but it is a nice buy!
3.0,"These are so cute but just not for me. You need large holes in your earlobes (or wherever you plan to wear them). Even if you have larger holes, it seems it would require care to insert them safely. They are adorable but I really can‚Äôt imagine who can wear these comfortably."
3.0,"The lens is not that dark and didn't filter out the light like I think they should have. This concerned me because I purchased these for my sons to use while playing baseball. I didn't try to bend too much or else they might break, but they seem okay. There are other youth sunglasses on the market that are more durable.<br />They also sent the wrong color, but I didn't factor that into the rating."
3.0,It was much thinner than I had anticipated but the 20mm width did fit the watch perfectly.
3.0,They only lasted 3 months
3.0,"Nice dress, nice fit ... I just don‚Äôt care for the material."
3.0,"cute, a lot bigger than i expected and some of the more fragile ones came broken. but pretty cheap"
3.0,You get what you pay for. Crappy lenses.
3.0,Loved the dress I should have ordered a XXXn now it‚Äôs too late it has sold out ‚òπÔ∏è
3.0,These are good quality. I like big sun glasses. But these are huge on my face.
3.0,"I don't know if its the color mix, but something is off. I guess now it will be my work cap for yard work etc"
3.0,"I got this dress as a secondary for prom because I wanted to see another option, I read sizing and ordered a medium, it went on smoothly I just couldn‚Äôt tie the back, the back cover they have makes it so if your two big for the dress part of your back will show, I hope others have better experience"
3.0,"Ordered black one & brown one. Brown one has ruffled edges, really cute. Ordered medium (I'm 5'4 /129 lbs). It was bursting at the seams. A large would probably be best if you're a medium and don't like tight clothes."
3.0,The color was beautiful but the padding showed so much that couldn‚Äôt keep it. Fit how I expected but wasn‚Äôt very supportive.
3.0,I like the glitter & bling of this phone case & the way that the stuff floats around depending on how you hold the phone.  The problem is that when I ordered it online the description was BRIGHT red & when it arrived it was not bright red it was coral!  I would have preferred red.  That's why I only gave it three stars
3.0,Great thing awesome but the back pin support wasn't as great. Fell off somewhere so basically it's a ripoff. The pin in the back doesn't push all the way down so it makes it easy to slip off. Another thing is that it is so heavy the top part like falls down. It really sucks. Now I have a pin that doesn't work and its lost somewhere!
3.0,"It's a snazzy little key chain.  It is a bit pricy, but it is solid, does not feel cheap at all."
3.0,The converters are well made. The size of them are small. I am new to this converter and will order bigger sizes
3.0,I love them other than they are a little to big on the one end for what I needed them for
3.0,Looks great but I ordered a larger size and they were still to small. I have them away
3.0,very soft to the skin
3.0,"This was cute, but the top was too big and the bottom fit just right, but it looked all frompy. I returned it. The material did seem kinda see through you may need to wear something underneath. It is stretchy"
3.0,"It's that poor quality printing. Like they printed a picture of a sweatshirt, is the best way I can describe it. Weak stitching. It will surely not hold up to continuous wear or washing. Would also say it runs small. However, it is soft and my kid likes it. Looks good from a distance."
3.0,I ordered these in a 2X / 3X and they were very very hard to get on. Had to order a different brand in order to get a good fit.
3.0,Size larger than espect!
3.0,Corre peque√±a
3.0,I ordered the small and it was giant on me. Cute dress but didn't fit so I had to return it
3.0,"First, I want to start with the positives. It is very soft and comfortable to wear while sleeping. The pockets are great for carrying around your cellphone. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and this gown is just right for the length. Had I been an inch taller it would be too short.<br />Now the negatives...it isn‚Äôt pink but a faded peach color. I weigh 160 pounds and the large was almost too small. The material is clingy and sheer. A little too sheer for my liking. I couldn‚Äôt wear this on my patio to drink a cup of coffee. The neighbors would know all my business! The only reason I kept this is because I got them for $9. If the price is more than that...keep looking!"
3.0,The necklace in itself is super cute but chain is super tiny almost a choker..or made for a very small girl...not for a grown-up
3.0,"Pretty, but dips down too far in the back for wearing in a pool to keep sun off."
3.0,Hard to fit but tough once on
3.0,It hasn‚Äôt come yet. Ordered it June 19. Now it‚Äôs July 7th. Not expected to arrive until September.<br />Really?
3.0,"Cheap quality, turns finger green and metal changes color"
3.0,The shirt had a nice fit in the body and arms but the turtle neck was too big. It looked stretched out. We safety pinned it to tighten it up.
3.0,This has no clasps or any way to keep it on without holding it. It's pretty long and awkward as well.
3.0,I am 5‚Äô0 and 120 lb. My back is on the wider side. Bought a medium. I wish it could fit my back better. It‚Äôs just kind of tight. The sleeves are a little too long but it‚Äôs not terrible. Skirt is short. I am still very happy!
3.0,Colors were very pretty but they weren‚Äôt full like the picture shows but I still wear them bc it‚Äôs not to bad had compliments on them
3.0,"Not leather. Barely fits a large. It's pretty, but I wouldn't buy again"
3.0,"I don‚Äôt know if it fits or not, but it was completely soaked when I pulled it out of the package. I am going to wash it before I have her try it on. If you look at the packaging you can see some of the water droplets. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed and disgusted!"
3.0,Very uncomfortable claps
3.0,"The straps are not made strong enough for what they are attaching to, one of the straps ended up snapping off after the second washing, so after that I bought another one and I no longer put it in the dryer, I hang dry to hopefully prevent it from falling apart- may the force be with you."
3.0,"It was cute. Gave it to my daughter for her Pandora occasion collection. Her only problem with it is that, the latch which holds the letter close doesn't work. It remains open!"
3.0,"Nice costume but runs very small.  I normally wear a size medium and this is too small for me so I will be returning it.  Too bad, it's cute!"
3.0,To tight. Returned
3.0,"I've ordered flowy tunics off Amazon before, but decided to give this brand a try. Based on previous reviews, I ordered one size up from my normal size. The style and color are as pictured and expected, but the sizing is way off. Itts a really tight, clingy material on my arms and chest, and is flowy around the belly area. I should've ordered two sizes up instead of one, but at this point I don't want to go through the hassle of making a return."
3.0,I like it. Good Value. Quality is ok.
3.0,"These are adorable and great for the price, but all of the buttons started falling off immediately."
3.0,It's okay...Looks way better in the photo than in person...Kinda cheesy but it'll do.
3.0,"Dress is super cute and fit my daughter.  However, the sleeves are elastic and my daughter complained they were tight and itchy. Since it wasn't comfortable to wear, I returned."
3.0,Does not shape the body
3.0,"When I recieved my package the box was torn apart, and Peins ring is very uncomfortable to wear due to the size adjust piece. Other than that it was a good buy."
3.0,"The magnet is not strong enough for triathlon, particularly swimming.  After a month, I find myself frequently stopping to tighten the watch band.  This is only an issue during workouts and races."
3.0,Looks just like the photo<br />Stays on the face without much discomfort<br />The eye holes could be a bit bigger but not a big issue.<br />Peripheral vision is very limited however it is better than the rubber mask which caused the same effect only with excessive sweating.
3.0,"Great bottoms, fits great and not too thin where u can see through."
3.0,38 IN. FIT LIKE A 36 IN.
3.0,I normally wear a L or XL! I ordered XXL and it is more like a SM! Extremely off on sizing!
3.0,To tight! Had trouble pulling over my head.
3.0,Bought it to wear to a tea party but it was too small.
3.0,I love the fit and the vibrant colors. I am on my feet a lot during the day and traditional socks were biting into my flesh by the end of the day. My feet feel refreshed all day and don‚Äôt feel tired. The socks come in a variety of colors. Good value for the money. They wash well. I line dry mine. My only complaint is that the royal blue pair looks like something has chewed on it. There are holes in the material. None of the other colors came that way. Of course it‚Äôs my favorite color.  If it hadn‚Äôt been for the 1 ruined pair I would have given a higher rating.
3.0,"Thos top was too cropped for me. It looked longer in the advertisement. It's about as big as a bra rather than a shirt. The material is soft and comfortable but I can't wear this outside the house. All in all, I can't reccomend it if your wanting a traditional crop length top."
3.0,"The quality of the fabric gets 3 star rating. However, the color is not as shown in the photo."
3.0,Too shallow for me.I had gaping and quadboob at the same time.
3.0,Bought a few pairs of shorts. These were ok but others were better so I returned these.
3.0,"It's a nice sweatshirt that fits well... except in the sleeves. They're comically baggy, you'd need the worlds biggest biceps to fill this thing out. It's enough to make the sweatshirt look messy and it's even difficult to wear a jacket overtop cause the excess sleeve fabric bunches up. Would not buy again."
3.0,The size was way off. It was bought from China and I could not return it with it costing me $300 dollars and the vest was only $60.00. I will absolutley make sure not to buy from another country without knowing I could not return it. Disappointed in Amazon.
3.0,"These must be made for infants/toddlers...The post is super short. They're super pretty, just don't know that I'll be able to wear them."
3.0,The quality is great... beautiful fabric but the size is way off... I would say the xlarge was somewhere between a M and a L.
3.0,"I just got this in the mail and am wearing it now. It is so big, and I got a small. I read so many people writing amazing comments about PattyBoutik and I thought a lot of her items were super cute. This... I don't know... The material is EXTREMELY sheer, which is quite odd considering it  is a thicker fabric. I don't even know if I would bother getting it hemmed.I don't think I like it on myself, maybe if I got it hemmed an entire foot, it would look nice. (Yes, I am standing on a toilet, and yes, I know the socks don't really help the look of the dress.) Hopefully someone can use my photos as a way to tell if it will fit them well. As for me, I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm leaning more towards returning it. I think it would look absolutely amazing on someone taller, but seeing as I am 5'1&#34;, it just isn't for me. We'll see."
3.0,"For the price, this was an ok item. However the tutu came undone within minutes of wearing. You could see a spot when I first opened the item from the packaging where it wasn't made correctly. It accomplished what I ordered it for, my daughter's birthday party outfit, but that is it. The shirt portion was fine and material otherwise fine."
3.0,I purchased this sweatshirt. It's has nice material. But in China the size of an XL is actually a medium. So adjust your purchase accordingly. Get an XXXL if your an XL.
3.0,Even after cutting this insoles still bulky and I need a size bigger shoe to fit it in. I work standing up for 8 hours or longer every day and it didn't really help my foot pain. It actually made my feet numb for bit. But I like the fact that has odor eliminator.
3.0,This kit is just right for what I wanted it for. It was for my son' s presentation in school. Good price. The globe though is not that great.
3.0,It doesnt fit my ring finger like it should
3.0,Product looks and feels of good quality. The biggest downside for me was the window is not big enough to display the whole coin. The edges of the coin are covered from where the stitching is attached to the plastic cover.
3.0,"I ordered these for my son for Christmas last year, to get him through a terribly cold winter in Rochester NY.  They do fit a little bit snug, but my son is a bit on the small side of his size, so that worked out ok for him.  For most people though, I think I would order a size larger than what you actually need.<br /><br />They are actually quite thin.  He liked this because they didn't add any bulk when worn under his clothes, but if you are looking for extreme cold protection, you might actually want to buy a thicker set.  They have held up through SEVERAL washings, and have lasted quite well.  For the price point, you could probably find a better quality set, but these worked well and he liked them."
3.0,"Great as a cheap gift, don't expect long lasting quality and you wont be disappointed."
3.0,"Definitely too small. Shape of toes are weird. I compared them with another pair in exact size, questioning if these are actually Vibrams or generic being passed as Vibrams....<br /><br />(Picture included: just purchased on left via purchased directly from Vibram on the right. Note how far down pinky toe is....)"
3.0,"The cups are too thing and too large, and the round band is too small, one is smaller than the other."
3.0,Shirt was way bigger than expected and pattern and shape looked a little different from the picture.
3.0,This skirt fits as expected. Pattern is nice‚Ä¶ but the elastic it has at the waist is one of those thin and flimsy ones that bends all over the place after just one wear and then it never goes back to normal. It‚Äôs pretty annoying‚Ä¶ I really wanted to love this skirt
3.0,Paint wore off fast
3.0,Comfortable? Yes.  Stretch? Good. However not easy to clean.
3.0,The style wasn't very fitting so it made my mom look a little frumpy. Just wasn't her taste but well made dress!
3.0,"This won‚Äôt be my favorite bra, but I was able to forget I was wearing it for the most part, which is the best I can seem to hope for. It‚Äôs hard to find 32C, and the 34As I used ro put up with are just no use anymore. I did not find the lace overly itchy, although I can say the texture is noticeable. The lining is a nice knit, and the fabrics feel soft to the touch. It is the edge elastic that I find subtly itchy, although after two washes I can ignore it. The bands meet the cups high, so there‚Äôs slight chafing at ny armpits. The whole bra covers a lot of territory - it is sports bra level coverage. Handwashed first, and the foam defirmed creating a visible divet in the midle of the cup - visible under clothing. Fortunately a machine wash cleared that up. I‚Äôd rather this was $20 or leas but I‚Äôll keep it."
3.0,"Love the shirt, very soft & super fast delivery. The only problem is the size. It‚Äôs 2 full sizes too small, so if you buy size up!"
3.0,"The chains are horrible and look really cheap. Just throw them out and plain on using the pendant itself, and you'll be fine. Do not expect to want to use those chains that this comes with more than twice."
3.0,The size is too small
3.0,My granddaughter loves the dress.  It does run on the small size so I ordered one size larger than she wears.  It was snug but she wears it anyway because she loves the dress.  The dresses do run on the small size.
3.0,This size fit my ears nicely.  Not concerned with exact positioning of gems so ok if they spin.
3.0,fur only goes on one side
3.0,I have only worn it three times and it is already loosing its coating. Center stone is beautiful though.
3.0,"Honestly, the dress was just to big so it wasnt very flattering on me."
3.0,"I am normally a large, and I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. The material is nice, my sister got the short sleeves shirt and that is great too. However, DO NOT MACHINE WASH right away. I followed the instructions, and I washed it in cold water and the lettering turned out pink. I am currently finding out if I can get a refund. Also, the neck and cuffs are not a lighter burgundy as it shows in the picture, they are red/wine."
3.0,Size was 12-14 but difficult to pull up on90 lbs 10 year old. Colors nice and bright.
3.0,Cute but shorter than expected
3.0,Top is somewhat large & bottoms are somewhat small.
3.0,"They‚Äôre ok, but they don‚Äôt look like the photo on me. But I like them"
3.0,"I like the look.  However, it gets all tangled and twisted all the time.  I constantly have to untangle it.  I'm afraid that after awhile the chain will simply break."
3.0,I ordered a small and it‚Äôs still quite large. The collar is awkward. But generally comfortable
3.0,"It did seem short after I mounted my watch on it. After checking the Amazon ad again, I noted they are claiming it to be 12"" long; no way. For my wrist, it could use another .5 inch in length. I can barely tuck the extra back under the loop to store it, and it does come out sometimes during normal ware. Otherwise, it does seem ok, it a bit on the lighter gage side. Should have returned it, but for$13, it didn't seem worth it."
3.0,"I loved the fabric, it's a beautiful dress but it's a tight fit. I suggest your order a size bigger if your a plus size girl."
3.0,Great blouse but run way too small.
3.0,Runs SMALL!!  A 2X  is probably equivalent to an XL.
3.0,"First, let me start out with my measurements to give you a general idea of my body structure. I'm 5'2 and weigh 140 lbs.  I wear most of my weight on my lower half. My measurements are 36C top, 27 in waist, and 36 in hips.<br /><br />So, I ordered a large because I have full thighs. I'm sure a medium would have fit but I didn't want anything digging into my thigh jiggle. Lol. I  received a small. üòíüòí I tried it on and it fit perfectly around my stomach. My stomach is pretty toned BUT not so well on my thighs. I can still wear it to the beach and stuff because it doesn't look bad. I just need to focus on my thighs when I hit the gym.<br /><br />All in all, It's an alright product. It has a decent amount of stretch and the material is of good quality. It would have been perfect if I received the size I wanted."
3.0,The material is cheap and it ripped within a couple of wears.
3.0,"These hoops are incredibly difficult to close. So much so, that I returned them for a refund. I so wanted these to work for me. I tried to close them for nearly 15 minutes. Way too much work for earrings."
3.0,"These are well made, just run big!"
3.0,I loved the necklace I wore it twice by the second time it had already broke where the eye is cannot be fixed
3.0,The watch looks really nice but it seems the leather strap quality isn't that great. The strap may tear if not used carefully.
3.0,Might look good on someone else - but I didnt like the fit - too big
3.0,"Received this product a few days ago. It was nicely packaged, however, this purse zipper is difficult to open and close. I tried my iPhone 6s and case in the pocket it was not able to close. I am disappointed."
3.0,I only receive three.!!<br />Can I get what I bought<br />I need my more two.!
3.0,"Love the look!  Others will too.  Consider painting your face as the mask won't remain on for long, too hot & stuffy.  You'd think after 5 years of reviews the mfg. would get the hint about packaging the mask separately in a box to keep its shape.  I'd pay a few extra bucks for the packaging.  The white ascot is also a joke and wasting material making this part of the costume.  Don't they read these reviews?"
3.0,"Thought I'd try these due to the low price.  Well, the old adage is true, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  Ok socks, but not really &#34;compression&#34; socks.  True compression socks should be a challenge to get on and provide compression from toe to to upper calf.  These fall short of that.  They are a nice pair of socks, but they're just that...socks.<br />If you want true compression socks, try Victory Athletic Gear.  I've bought 4 pair from them on here, and they are great!!<br />https://www.amazon.com/Compression-Graduated-Pregnancy-Circulation-Recovery/dp/B072MFZCZB/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1510689543&sr=8-2&keywords=victory+athletic+gear&dpID=41WC5NNHpHL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch"
3.0,Nice price breathable & comfort was good but these are really small. Barely fits my 8 yo. Absolutely no room to grow. I'm afraid to wash them because I don't want the mask to shrink. I'll keep them because school starts  Monday and well today is Saturday night.
3.0,I liked the fit of these pants. The weight is light but they‚Äôre going back since the white is see through. They‚Äôd be great as a bathing suit cover up.
3.0,"I don't have big arms yet everything on this jacket fits right and the sleeves are tight. This is a first for me. Cant wear it and it is too expensive to do a return. Money wasted.<br /> I am updating this review. Gave this jacket to a friend who made some minor adjustments since she is smaller than me. The jacket looks great on her and she love love it. It looks very professional. I am pleased also to say that based on my complaint the company contacted me and did a partial refund. Exceptional care, customer service and concern for customer satisfaction. My applause and thanks to Green Co. Ltd. Well done."
3.0,Small holes in the white  shirt straight out the package...no washing instructions on clothing at all..light and comfy tho
3.0,Love the color. However the loop broke and the leather quality is cracking had it for 4 months
3.0,Feels plastic
3.0,These are good quality gloves. Not for dishwashing. Way too slippery and punctures easily. Better for carwash or pet washing.
3.0,This show is for very narrow feet if the upper portion of the foot is thicker these will not fit. My child wears normal sizes no medium or wide fit.
3.0,"I'm still not too sure about this. I don't know if it is authentic or not and no one has contacted me even after I asked them if it was or not, so i assume it's not. It's a pretty bag, just looks kind of cheap. I wish I would have looked around for a bag more before impulse buying. Not 100% happy."
3.0,"i was really hoping for a &#34;scuba&#34; style skirt, but this missed the mark. it fits great, its waist band is nothing fancy, the length is perfect, the slit in the back is great, but it is see-through! i was hoping for much thicker fabric, but it is very thin. i bought the mocha color thinking that if its dark it won't be see-through, i couldn't be more wrong. its completely see-through between my legs. my only hope is that obviously i won't be walking around with my legs wide open and therefore can probably get away with wearing it, at night, maybe. i really love the style, but i might consider purchasing some kind of slip to wear, if i buy another. great price, sad that it is see-through."
3.0,"Bought this to help research some old coins, but since I couldn't comprehend the book this hasn't come out of the box."
3.0,The collar looks like from the 20s
3.0,A bit too heavy for my ears. BUT VERY pretty!!
3.0,Keeps your shirt tucked in but the buckles rub on your leg.
3.0,"It's a mask. Double layered. Soft. The design is paisley print on polyester fabric.  It is not embossed like it looks in the photo. I was going to have this for a formal/dressed occasion. It looks like a cheap print fabric (which it is).. that's  why I dinged stars off it.<br />I thought I got a bargain but its not.<br />I'm not going to return it because its functional. But it is not a ""fashion"" mask,"
3.0,i gave it 3 stars cause the handle section cuts my skin. returned.
3.0,They seem great for about 2 weeks and then my son who's just over two years old was able to pull apart the straps and now he can't wear them
3.0,Looked more like a night gown then a dress. Daughter wasnt a fan.
3.0,"I order a lot of dresses off amazon. The arms on this dress is very tight and unflattering. I order the same size on my dresses and this one has extremely tight arms. Also, where it falls on the neck is not typical."
3.0,I like the sunglasses but the front lenses are completely scratched.
3.0,I liked them but the lens broke easily
3.0,The colors aren‚Äôt as vibrant as the picture. And I ordered a large and it was WAYYY too big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù 158lbs. I will be returning it and ordering a smaller size.
3.0,This is a very pretty pendant. The rose quartz is of good quality and the wrap design is pretty. I got a lot of compliments the first time I wore it. It is nice and would make a nice present.
3.0,"I have a few pairs of these, all from the same size chart. The inner tights on these are too small, to the effect that the pull my pants low in the back, giving me plumber crack at the slightest bend. I've had issue with others but these were the worst I've encountered. Shorts are nice, nothing special but a decent pair...aside from the crack issue."
3.0,"Although th person it was given to loved it, it broke after having worn it twice. Unfortunately it was a gift and the return window closed a month after purchase."
3.0,"My daughter loves this cover up.  The colors are bright, but the fabric is very thin.  I don't thing it will last past this summer."
3.0,"I have had these for less than a week, and worn them to work from home for 3 of those days.  They are extremely comfortable and fit well.  Unfortunately, they have already started to pill on the butt area.  It's not a big enough problem to prevent me from maybe ordering a second pair, but they are certainly only for wearing at home if the bottom looks that way so quickly."
3.0,"It is thinner than the other dresses I ordered, Berrydress love them! This dress line is beautiful and true to size but it is sheerer than I expected.  I am not sure how to wear this because of that."
3.0,"Attractive, but poor quality lens makes for diminished vision."
3.0,Ok hat but not up to Drakes normal standards.
3.0,"Very cheap plastic, broke early on."
3.0,Had to return them sans get one size up
3.0,"I bought two, one for me and one for my wife. If I were writing the review for my band, I would say it is a great band and that I‚Äôm very happy with it.  But I found sizing the band to be impossible. I had to by another band for my wife that was east to size."
3.0,"..I was disappointed with the Shapewell Strappy bra-it was just too snug so not comfortable. All the XL size items I've gotten have been good but not this one.-  It's constructed well, washed and dried nicely, no loose threads and the orange is a little different, I like!"
3.0,I was looking for a longer workout top for outdoor activities.
3.0,Flimsy but the only one available the swatch I have!
3.0,Mask looked exactly like I expected from the picture. I did not think about how I would wear this with glasses (which was my fault) but it was not possible to wear this mask with my glasses. The tops and bottom of the metal butterfly were bent (maybe to fit into the packaging) and when I bent the ends back the black peeled off so that the metal showed. Since I only needed it for 1 party in a dark Ballroom it wasn't a big deal but if I'd wanted it for multiple uses I'd have been very upset.
3.0,I bought these glasses to replace another set that my son broke.  I thought the design was nice and the amber high contrast lenses would be awesome (for me lenses are everything).  The design is nice. And that's about it.  The lenses are an okay shade of amber.  But I had to pop the left lens back in right out of the package and the gradient shading is really annoying.  Also the shade is not very dark at all.  The manufacturers should have kept the same shade throughout the entire lens.  I will be looking for another set of sunglasses again shortly.  These are a good backup pair.  I would not buy then again.
3.0,Grandson loves them but the shorts are big and the  shirt is a very small
3.0,Not as long as it is portrayed and the color was more red than burgundy. Still a cute shirt though!
3.0,"The pin itself is pretty, but the pin closure on the back is very hard to work with.  I don't know if I just got a bad one or if their all like that but,  its too much of a hassle to send it back so I'll just keep it, but I can't really recommend it."
3.0,"I got white. No way to wear with panties or bras, so thin it's totally see through."
3.0,It kinda fell apart on me after a few months of wearing it. It was nice while I had it.
3.0,My wife thought the chains were larger than expected.  She will put it to good use for a costume.
3.0,The hat did not come with a hair tie. The hat is pretty large and I feel like I am average on the head size. I have to cinch it pretty tight and then the elastic gets bunched. The brim sticks out pretty far and is hard to shape. I will probably only wear it if my other hats are dirty or I plan on getting dirty. I would not buy another one.
3.0,The dress is very pretty but it was made for girls without curves. I couldn't button it in the chest area.
3.0,You get what you pay for. The clasp bent (I bent it back) and I don't expect it to last more than a few wears. Nice color though.
3.0,"When I took these out of the package I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of thick padding. Sadly, after riding, the padding is not quite in the correct spot where I need it most. Another issue I have is that they are a little too short and end up riding up my legs as I ride and then my legs chafe.  And I‚Äôm only 4f11! I would‚Äôve returned them but I‚Äôm past the window."
3.0,Wish they stayed wide open when trying to place items inside
3.0,Really hard to pull on.
3.0,"Not small in width but drawstring is set too high, and I am not even tall - 5'5.."
3.0,"The ""rings"" are not wearable on a finger. Maybe on a chain. One of the little pins that kept it together was loose in the bag. I make most of my own jewelry so fixing it is no big deal for me. Some people would be upset."
3.0,These are ok the nipple pads slip off your nipple so you have to adjust them a lot I don‚Äôt like that. Very flexible not a lot of underwire support like I like. But for price not bad
3.0,Shoes are a thin vinyl and they run small. I normally wear an 8.5 but ordered a 9. Too small. Luckily they are only for a costume.
3.0,Nice style but not a long-term product. Goes a few washes and wears before starting to fall apart
3.0,"This top is pretty and it is well made.<br /><br />The problem is that it is way too small, especially in the chest. You'll want to go up a size, if you are larger in the chest you'll want to go up two sizes."
3.0,You need a larger size then you would Originally wear. Fits tight in chest and armpit area.
3.0,"I have one of the larger smartphones and the zipper was too short, making it really difficult to get the phone in and out. It is a nice warm fleece, but not necessarily attractive, just warm. It is long enough to wrap nicely around the neck twice."
3.0,"I ordered a 20/22 and the shirt I received is tagged 24/26.  It fits perfectly and I love it, but I have no idea how to order it again because 24/26 isn't even available?!  I normally wear a 20/22 or 2X, so I'm guessing this runs slightly small."
3.0,Meh. Felt cheaply made. I liked all the space it offered but I ended up sending it back.
3.0,Super cute but the zipper was defective
3.0,"Quality seems good, color is great. Just fit much bigger than expected. I had even got out a measuring tape."
3.0,These are super cute before you wash them. Faded after 1 wash. Top fits well but the shorts are a little tight on my thighs and super short. Wanted these for a girls trip but will only wear these in my own home
3.0,Tshirt I received Not the same as in the picture. The one I received is see thru white fabric & has orange hearts... purchase for work. Unfortunately cannot wear a see thru shirt to work.
3.0,The material was too thin. The trademark for Ohio State was too small.
3.0,"Pretty colors,but the belt loops were not same on both sides & pockets too low.I will have to hem it for sure.üò¢"
3.0,size up by 2. too tight. material is good. Good quality
3.0,"Sleeves are snug, bodice VERY sheer, and probably too much material therefore baggy stomach. Perfect dress for a sunny day where you have a food baby and you don't want to suck it in."
3.0,"My expectations weren't very high given the low price, but I was in a pinch to get a cover-up before a trip.  One of the string ties fell off when I tried it on, and there was a small (2"") hole at one of the side seams.  Was able to make the repairs easily, so it's fine.  An XS would have fit better if offered (5'0 and 108lbs)."
3.0,"The bag is ok. Barely fits an iPad mini. The outside zippers are small in length which makes it difficult to keep or take out anything. The inside pocket lengths are almost 1/3rd of the bag length as stitches for the pockets end up much higher. The bag is lightweight, would have been a great messenger bag if pocket and zipper lengths were little increased."
3.0,size is off
3.0,Too thin. Rides up as well.
3.0,they are nice looking but very difficult to get the post back into the hole.
3.0,"Nice hat, not the color pictured, kind of light gray."
3.0,"Bright nice quality, smaller than expected but I still like it"
3.0,"This time I ordered an XL, still snug! Love the shirt ,because I was able to pull it on . The material is abit &#34;itchy&#34;, hopefully I'll have room for a cami! Because, it's black your skirt or pants will have to allow summer heat not to burn you up! I , did not see what other parts - material is made of .Caution, hope the whole shirt is heat retardant before allowing children to wear it.  It only has a size label on it. And the store! To bad I really love the design."
3.0,they shrunk
3.0,"These are ok. The cut isn‚Äôt like the other GN shorts I own so I wear these around the house, but not out in public"
3.0,Not the material I was expecting.. but I guess I didn't read the description.. so not really something I like.
3.0,"It feels nice, the stretch material allows it to be comfortable on the waist, but it is flared on the bottom making it seem as it was  meant for a short person. Now I have to have it professionally tapered.  The color runs too."
3.0,"Really cute necklace for the money, but the animal print is paperlike and immediately started coming unglued from the metal."
3.0,"This one was fun, but the first thing that happened was the zipper came right off when I zipped up the suit. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be constructed very well.<br /><br />It was a tad hard to get in to (zipper issue aside), but once I got it on it was comfortable to wear."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt love it but it‚Äôs  not the  dresses  fault - it‚Äôs my body
3.0,"I like how it looks and it works fine, but it has a cheap looking face."
3.0,"Very soft,love the colors and I'm ordering another now! Highly recommend!! üòäHowever only 3stars,I'm a size 0 got a sm but couldn't breathe in it so I'm reordering in a lg!"
3.0,"The set is cheaply made but acceptable looking. Care must be taken when placing them on your garment, as the &#34;post&#34; that the pips attach to bend easily.  Hopefully they will hold up to a full two days of cosplaying without falling off or bending."
3.0,"Looks nice, feels cheap!"
3.0,Not as fitting as I expected. A bit to long.
3.0,"This dress in the red with bell sleeves was very cute but way too thin. It could only be used a a beach cover up unless you wore a full slip, and who wants to do that in the summer. I wish the material had been thicker because the style was so cute."
3.0,"super cute, was nice quality, but the ball kept falling off until I eventually lost it. ended up using another ball from an other piece and lost that one too. if the balls could stay on the bar it would be a 5/5!"
3.0,I loved these but was buying for pockets and they have no pockets so I returned
3.0,"I love the colors and want so badly to wear these, but the seams that cross at the toes are very thick and stiff, they caused me a lot of discomfort over my little toes.  I just can‚Äôt wear them. Hopefully if i wash them a few times they will soften, but they‚Äôll still be very thick. Maybe not as hard as they are now, new. The pair i received at Christmas are also lovely, and have been washed but still difficult to wear. Otherwise I would gladly give them five stars.  I don‚Äôt know what could be done to fix this problem, as the material is thick and textured.  It‚Äôs lovely, really.  PS. Since I washed these they are softer. I am very hopeful!  I LOVE these socks and will give them a chance to soften!"
3.0,"Quality, color and fir is great.<br /><br />Has been worn and washed twice now. Material is very scratchy and not soft in the slightest bit.<br /><br />Maybe long tern if might get a little aofter but for now, it is pretty rough."
3.0,was nice but runs small -- sleeves a little long overall
3.0,I couldn't get them on.  Too small or too tight
3.0,Way too long for me plus there were a couple of buttons missing so I am returning it.
3.0,"Mostly good quality, but I ordered a 0 and these look to be too small. (It‚Äôs a gift so u can‚Äôt tell for myself)<br />They also are two different lengths...<br />I‚Äôll still be gifting these in hopes that they work."
3.0,Very very heavy sneakers!
3.0,"looked alright for the price, but mine pretty much fell apart at each link holding it together. If the links where a bit stronger this would be one of the best."
3.0,"Great concept, poor construction on internals. The outside of the case is very durable, the pockets on the inside are not, and began separating shortly after I started using it. This allows the cards inside to slide out of the wallet onto the ground if the wallet is not opened perfectly horizontal."
3.0,This item is cute for daily use it‚Äôs just bit frustrating to adjust because it‚Äôs got stock every time.
3.0,Cute but runs a bit too small.
3.0,"Arrived crushed...returned it b/c it was a creased up. They shipped it in a poly bag with no protection. Hat was nice and lightweight. The color band was more like a womens hair scrunchie. Would have been a good value for the price, had it been shipped in a box."
3.0,Bought this for my daughter for she's 9 and the pendent was very cute. I just put it on a new chain. But it was a great deal for a gift for someone. So I would recommend it..
3.0,Bright and Colorful. Very soft.
3.0,Craftsmanship is sloppy on my bracelets but at this price can‚Äôt really expect much
3.0,Rings - They are cute and bought them for models to use during photoshoot but they are a &#34;one size fit all kind of thing...
3.0,"lovely and happy with it , but will buy three more and sew them together to make it as large as I want for my use.<br />I bought one to see it's quality etc....it's nice."
3.0,Great buy! Love the glasses! There is a weird/bothersome haze/defect in the right lens that was on the classes when they arrived. I've tried to clean it off but it's still there. Will be exchanging the defective pair for a new one.
3.0,"These are very small,  hard to see the Gamecock logo.....I would not order again..."
3.0,Sheds drizzle or light rain but 20 minutes today on a downpoor and I was wet inside on shoulders and anywhere else there is a seam. Glad I did not rely on a pocket to protect a cellphone as everything paper in all pockets was wet.<br /><br />It will get you from the car to the mall in the rain to go buy a real raincoat if that is what you want.<br /><br />i wrote this because I am getting tired of things that are only water reistent being sold as waterproof.<br /><br />Otherwise the jactet is warm even wet in this case (60 degrees out)  and looks nice so for very light rain and a cool breeze it is OK.
3.0,Okay for price Lights dulled and then went out quickly. Not very sturdy or durable but they served their purpose.
3.0,"The dress is certainly baggy enough to be comfortable on most larger bodies but the manufacturer forgot that bigger bodies also have bigger upper arms.  I thought the fabric would stretch out a little because it‚Äôs kind of puckered, but nope. Arms are too tight. Luckily I can sew so I can do something to make it wearable, but it always kind of ticks me off when I have to alter things like this."
3.0,"Loved these but come on, I got one earring and here is clearly two pictured. Not good advertising bro."
3.0,"These are ok. Super light, so good for tender ears.  Not so happy with the cheap gold, but for price pretty nice."
3.0,"Well-made, but largely useless, really."
3.0,I can't seem to understand the sizing for this item. I bought a 4t and the top fits like a 2t while the shorts fit like a 5!
3.0,"lovely bag, roomy enough for weekender, love the spinner wheel BUT hate the weak handle, this is why I bought a new one. The other one I have has a flimsy handle, very week as you extend t!"
3.0,"Nice mask, but the picture was a bit blurry"
3.0,Bra piece was a bit small . But the swim suit is truly beautiful.
3.0,"Fit as expected but horrible fishy odor!!! Pants have stretch. Ordered a large, It‚Äôs the thighs and butt for me lol. If you don‚Äôt mind the odor order them."
3.0,Good if you have a couple of them just 1 is really small
3.0,Too wide.  Hard to wear because of it.  Disappointing.
3.0,Cute!  Was looking for Minnie Mouse pajamas for a granddaughter.  She was tickled to get Minnie Mouse but pretty darned expensive for the quality of the fabric and the colors not as bright or image as clear as seen on picture.
3.0,I absolutely love the sides but the lenses are to big and round and look horrible on me. Wish you would make a more natural lens size. Not everyone looks good with this look.
3.0,A medium is exactly what you would think. I returned my purchase because these were cut way too low for someone my age.
3.0,"These were see through,  not what I was wanting"
3.0,"You should include the word ""mini"" in your description.  These are VERY small.  Good quality, but small to be considered an ear cuff."
3.0,The shirt was
3.0,When we got the shirt it did not have the Country Life lettering on the sleeve as shown in picture.
3.0,Very cute but order up a size.
3.0,"It was good quality, but was missing the keys."
3.0,"Nice pants. Good material. I'm 5'0 and 150 lbs. First pair I ordered a medium. They were a little snug so I sent them back. Second pair I ordered a large and they fit great in the tummy and thigh area. But from the knees down...they was huge. And they were to long for me. Bummer because I really liked these pants and wanted them to fit, but they didn't."
3.0,This is ok. Get what you pay for i suppose. Very short!
3.0,"I'm neutral on these glasses.  You cannot fold them like normal glasses so they are more cumbersome to carry around, however they are very light weight and comfortable.  Almost like you don't even have them on. I would maybe buy them again if they were a little less money say $12-$15 maybe."
3.0,Printing was small
3.0,I‚Äôm disappointed that it was so cheap feeling but I should have known considering the price!
3.0,It‚Äôs a cute dress but too see through
3.0,"Fits very small, collar is short"
3.0,Read to much into the advertisement.. was really thinking they could be everything I was reading..it's good for the price..but I'll donate them..
3.0,"The skirt does not look anything like pictured. I definitely did not receive a high waist skirt. I am 5'3"" and I had to wear the skirt all the way below my belly button for it to be long enough to reach my ankle."
3.0,The plastic shafts are very fragile and tent to break if they bounce of and hit the floor.
3.0,"I loved these initially, but the elastic on the wrist is coming out.  That aside, the socks and gloves fit perfectly.  I haven‚Äôt had any issue with the grip dots coming off, and since my hands/fingers are small (I need youth gloves because adult sizes don‚Äôt fit) the holes for them are not too tight.  I could see how they would be too tight for larger hands."
3.0,Cute fit well but pretty sheer.
3.0,"It fits nothing like the picture, but‚Äôs it still cute enough for the price. It is coming apart at a couple seams. I fixed one area with hemming tape. The other hasn‚Äôt area hasn‚Äôt quite separated yet. You can see it in the front in the middle. The area that is more white than it should be."
3.0,"the necklace quality its not that good, (came broken) although i only paid 15 bucks, looks pretty  if you dont get too close  and its actually pretyy lightweight for a statement necklace this size."
3.0,Nice material quality but fit very tight in waist. Xlarge fit like a medium and the zipper detail wings appear silver on screen but they are actually gold.
3.0,"I like the details but, it is heavy and the upper and mid waist bands make it look like huge panty and hose lines, even under a loose dress."
3.0,"Says it fits up to a size 14, but I bought it for my sister (size 10) and the corset is WAY too small.  We are trying to figure out how to make it work, because the skirt and the wings are perfect."
3.0,"After a couple washes the material has started to pill and the zipper looks like sub-par quality because the key fell off in the drier. It's cozy and warm, but the quality doesn't seem to be there."
3.0,Not so good material
3.0,I don‚Äôt think the backing of this is very durable. I predict it falling apart before too long. The leather seems cheap.<br />Cute print though.
3.0,Realmente no fue lo q quer√≠a. Debajo de busto rizaba pico y no me agrad√≥.
3.0,This shirt was nice just too big for me
3.0,I had bought a pair of Dearfoams at a store and was surprised to find that the ones sent me from Amazon were smaller than I had expected but I can wear them and like them but they are a little narrow and shorter than expected.
3.0,It is actually very large-it is hard to gauge the size when buying on line
3.0,"This is a pretty skirt. It seems to run fairly large, as I am between 22-24 in women's plus size, I usually wear a 3x in some things and sometimes a 4x if things run small. I bought the 5x in this (because I'd read it ran quite small) and the 5x is too big on me. I think I'll have to exchange it for the 4x. Material is nice and vibrant, just like in the pictures, but not as stiff as it looks in the pics. By that I mean from the photos it almost seems as if the skirt will be like a taffeta and it's not that way at all, it's more like a polyester (?). Also, the bow is not at ALL as large and pretty as it is in the Amazon photos-maybe HALF the size, (if that). All in all, for the price, I think it's a nice, fun skirt. The fabric, while not as fancy as it looks in the photos, IS nice and bright and the pattern is just the same as pics. I'll buy one in some other colors too."
3.0,"I can see this would work great for people with normal sized heads but mine is on the smaller side and even the smaller size I ordered is too big. The wires are stiff and stick out behind my head lifting my hair out in a weird way, even on the tightest setting.  I had to bend the whole thing down to make it work so it wouldn't do that, but even then any upward movement of my head makes the glasses lift up off my nose. And forget being able to wear them in bed, for me at least, for the same reason of lifting off my face.  I really needed these to work for me at work because I'm always afraid my glasses are going to fall in the toilet while I'm helping a resident on the toilet.  They are lightweight and could be comfortable if they were smaller for me but the stiff wire would be better if it were more flexible and floppy, like silicone. It does not stretch but rather expands to a greater finite length.  So it's great for average heads but not for smaller ones."
3.0,Sizes vary some fit too large some fit too small very disappointed
3.0,"These are very cute, but some are covered in what looks like dirt.  Also small black spots are present on about half of the charms which is highly noticable because of the silver coating.  The price is right for what you get I guess."
3.0,Nice but the size of a small button. Expecting something lager.
3.0,The neck hole is awkward once in. Come down too low.
3.0,The fit was not comfortable on most of them. Cute but not a great fit.
3.0,"Not what I expected,hard to use"
3.0,"I like the soft material, I wished there was more actual support but its comfy to wear all day. This isnt ideal for hands free pumping vut you cohld still use this for pumping and easiest to quickly nurse your baby.  I feel as though I couldve ordered this bra a size up from what ot was ordered in but I still like this one."
3.0,it's really cute and for decent except it's way too short in the middle....which is a bummer
3.0,"Lighter material than what I thought. But ok.<br />Shipping disappointing, I hear how fast Amazon is.<br />I have items shipped from company‚Äôs that I have in 2 days free shipping."
3.0,"I brought these earrings hoping for them to be sterling silver, but they are enamel based with rhinestones embedded. The posts are sterling silver though, so that's great for those who have post allergies. After a week however, I lost the front ball on one of the earrings, it came loose from the entire earring. Upon further investigation, I also noticed the enamel around the stones was darkening as well, giving the earrings a cheap look. They were very pretty and sparkly in my ears the first few days though, so I'm giving them three stars for effort."
3.0,Very flimsy and cheap.  I kept them for my costume bin.
3.0,They do not stay in place..
3.0,"They were perfect out of the package, very soft. Washed once following washing instructions and they shrunk terribly."
3.0,small in size and not very elastic as i thought. but it has a v good quality.
3.0,My mom needed a new one and was happy to get it for Christmas. I should have known why the shipping was so much and the towel was not. I should have looked closer. Still it came by the time I needed it. Like I said my mom was happy and it fit the way she needed it.
3.0,"I would have rated it higher if this review was just about looks. The bag looks great. It feels great. It fits right under my shoulder. Unfortunately, I won't be using it much because I can't set it down without it tipping over since it doesn't have a flat/smooth base. I should have thought of this before I got it. The look and style of this bag makes it appealing for going out, and I didn't intend to use it as my daily workhorse purse. But, as I am uncomfortable hanging my purse on the back of a chair for waiters to bump into and the unscrupulous to easily grab, my use for it is defeated before I even start! If you buy it, just be aware that this is only for hanging on the back of your chair, or for storing things that don't mind getting tossed all about."
3.0,I love this shirt.. BUT.. the pockets have different stitch patterns.
3.0,very tough material. I did not find it very comfortable!
3.0,"Shirt didn‚Äôt fit, gave it to my bestie! She loved it. Material was nice and soft"
3.0,"For functionality, this passport holder is great.  I like the wallet portion at the top, several pockets for various cards, and two folds that can accommodate 2 passports if needed.  However, regarding the quality, it's not as luxurious as the reviews let on.  It is leather, but it doesn't feel like good quality leather. It does smell awful!!"
3.0,Cute but had bad chemical smell
3.0,Does the job a bit misshapen from shipping I guess
3.0,Its a shirt that wasn‚Äôt very soft and had a really wide fit with small armpit holes.
3.0,Don't buy if you don't have narrow feet.
3.0,I sized up on this shirt and it fit just right however the material feels like a paper towel and smells horrific when you first take it out of the package. I needed a white shirt for a family photo so it served its purpose and looked cute for that.
3.0,"These are really pretty and have great sparkle, but I've only worn them a couple of times after getting them last week and many of the crystals have fallen out."
3.0,Pida dos tallas m√°s de lo normal !!! GORRO extremadamente peque√±o !!! No sirve !
3.0,"Very stretchy, but fit more tightly than I would have liked"
3.0,I like it even though the material is super cheap and flimsy.
3.0,Rose and pearl fell off the first week I wore it
3.0,Super cute earrings. All the sones are loose though?? Will take to a jewelr to tighten
3.0,It is a cute top but fits weird.  I wear a medium and it is shorter than I'd like.  Not much room for give or stretch because of the lace
3.0,The sleeves are not lined as the rest of the coat but they help break light winds. I do like the little tie in the back to give it some feminine shaping.
3.0,"I wear this necklace every day! Unfortunately, I ordered one with a charm, and before long the charm fell off. Because I didn't notice it fall, I couldn't find it to reattach it. :( I still use the regular necklace part, but be warned that the charm may fall off if you purchase one with one!"
3.0,"Cute headbands, but not much in the way of grip.  They're almost too wide to stay in place without stretching back out again,"
3.0,Not the color green that is shows in The picture . Was a army green instead it should stay that !
3.0,The sizes are a bit off
3.0,Was cut very slim.  Sent back due to being too small.  Nice jacket though.
3.0,Generic hoodie. Nothing wrong with it but nothing terribly impressive.
3.0,"Sadly, straps are too short to actually wear but cute"
3.0,This is completely see through and not at all work appropriate.
3.0,"I was so excited to receive my shirt! Received a message about it being delayed by almost a week, then it showed up early. Oh well.<br />My issue with it that it is too small - I ordered an XL so it would be oversized but it fits more like a M/L. Also, the printing on the front is a very rigid piece of vinyl, like I‚Äôd expect from someone making shirts at home with a Cricut.<br />Disappointed overall, haven‚Äôt decided about returning it or not yet. Maybe if I wash it a dozen times the vinyl will soften up and I can call it vintage-style. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3.0,Fits ok but the underwire part is snug and uncomfortable for my liking
3.0,Love the skirt. I hate the top because it is made funny and it doesn‚Äôt fit properly either.
3.0,The little bottle is bigger then pictured but that is not the issue. the issue is it took forever and it arrived from china in nothing but a small plastic bag. no padding or anything to protect it from getting broken.<br />a little pissed
3.0,"Too small, can barely tell the color of the stone, and can barely tell you‚Äôre wearing anything."
3.0,"I like the suit, it was just not flattering on me. The material seemed to be good quality, and it was very supportive. I just didn't like the style. I am 5'5 180 lbs, and I carry most of my weight in my stomach. The suit made my waist look smaller and was very supportive. I ended up returning and getting a high waist tankini instead."
3.0,"The chain broke the first time I wore it. Not sure if a link came off, or what happened. Luckily I was able to fix it, for the price I can't really complain. Other than that I love it."
3.0,okay for the price.  Good for lower price pendants.
3.0,The top fits like a medium and i ordered a small. It looks like a dress when i put it on. I dont mind wearing it like that though.
3.0,"Chain it‚Äôs marked 10k , it looks good and sturdy even if thin . My only issue is the measurement is wrong .<br />Says 22 inch but I measure it and it‚Äôs 20 inch .<br />I‚Äôll keep it but a little disappointed"
3.0,"Attractive shirt, but for some reason the newer shirts from the same company are sizing way too small.  I didn't return it because I figured I could lose a few pounds, but I wound up just giving it away, which is also fine.  I've had to order the 4x when available recently, and they are a bit too big, so..."
3.0,It ran a bit small but the color was perfect
3.0,"This dress/shirt/whatever is cute.  It's NOT embroidered - it's just drawn on.  But it's super see-through.  I like it, but I probably will never wear it, so it's going back."
3.0,"The title is funny, it say premium. Well I would say it's premium but it nice. The quality could be a little better and the sewing could be a little stronger but item good for the money."
3.0,"What can you say about paper, it arrived in a timely manner and have been used for the purpose that it was ordered.  I would order from this vendor again and will recommend this product to anyone looking for some regular printing/copying paper for whatever reason they are going to utilize.  The whole process from ordering to delivery was performed in a timely and easy manner."
3.0,Beautiful and comfortable for the first few wears. Toe area completely scuffed up after 4-5 wears. Oh well.
3.0,Poor quality fabric that wrinkles and has no stretch. Too small in the top of the dress.
3.0,"Arrived with no problems.<br />Unlike the other colors I bought, the black one is HORRIBLE as it is a lint and pet hair magnet!<br />No matter how many times I wash it, it will always have lint and pet hair on it. This dress is like velcro. The other colors do not do this for some reason... I am thankful for that."
3.0,Super cute but worried it is going to be too big for my daughter.
3.0,The soles were slick on hard floors
3.0,Fit ok comfortable except for satin inside the neckline. ..makes me too hot around back of my neck
3.0,Top of it is cute but the skirt part is thin and cheap. Fits true to size
3.0,I really like the design of the belt and buckle but the buckle after a while starts to stick and is a pain to get it to stay tight
3.0,"They look great, I love the green color, and the logo is unobtrusive.  I really wish they had spring hinges and I did not notice any of the reflection issues that some people mentioned during the couple of weeks I wore them.  I ended up giving them to a friend because they were too small / my head was too wide."
3.0,"The picture of this product is extremely misleading; I expected the opals to fully encircle the band and be visible inside and outside.  The actual earrings have four of the opal bars on the outside front of the band, which then goes to silver the rest of the way on the outside, and these opal bars are not visible on the inside. The INSIDE back of the earring has four more opal bars with silver the rest of the way around the band, and are not visible on the outside. I'm sure they'll be fine to wear, but like most customers, I don't appreciate being fooled."
3.0,"Nice purse, especially for the price. I received several compliments on it. I like the compartments for organizing all of my stuff. The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because this bag is not comfortable worn over the shoulder. Considering the size of the purse, this makes it kind of annoying to carry around in your hand. Otherwise though, it is a nice purse especially for the price!"
3.0,"These are decent for the low price. They are a little long, so I used pliers to bend them into a better shape so the end doesn't dangle out of my nose. The jewels don't sit evenly in their setting, which is a little annoying but not really noticeable unless you look closely and doesn't interfere with their function."
3.0,"The fabric is super thin.  It is soft.  Basically, it is a tube of very thin fabric.  Have not tried them yet for sweaty hikes, so we shall see how they work.  I'm thinking they probably will not absorb sweat because they are synthetic fabric.  Not worth the price."
3.0,Doesn't fit like expected. Based on the picture I thought it would be much more baggy. Still cute though...
3.0,"Although this are delicate and pretty. They are extremely tiny and almost unseeable<br />In the photo they appeared to be much larger. Nonetheless, attractively package in a silver drawstring pouch. But I am disappointed"
3.0,"Mine did not have grommets in the belt holes, but otherwise holding up just fine."
3.0,"I ordered Small and this fits more like a medium, a little big on me."
3.0,Product arrived with a hole in one of the three leggings at the waist. ‚òπÔ∏èI see no way to communicate with the seller.<br />They do fit well and are warm.
3.0,"The button holes are to small in several points, especially the sleeves.  Also, it has no pocket.  At my age I want a pocket for pens etc."
3.0,Zero support for someone with D/DD boobs I have to use a bra under it then use this it is how ever soft and I‚Äôm sure better for someone with smaller cup size
3.0,"the quality of the cotton is not the best , it feels the material very thin."
3.0,"El g√©nero es hermoso, pero el dise√±o no es favorecedor, el corte queda debajo del busto y parece vestido de embarazada."
3.0,bought this to protect my tattoos from fading in a tannaning bed. worked well
3.0,To lose. Way to big
3.0,The product would‚Äôve gotten all 5 stars but the zipper is cheap. It fits great even with me being pregnant but the only way it would zip was after I took it off to zip it up. My husband tried zipping it for at least 20 minutes and it kept getting stuck in the same spot. We both got irritated then it finally zipped so I had to step into it. I‚Äôm glad it fits but the zippers definitely need to be changed.
3.0,The hat is fine but the lettering is much much smaller than it appears in the photo and not very vibrant.
3.0,Fit too small and I ordered big
3.0,"Comfortable,  but runs small."
3.0,1. The shirt is not all white. It has grey buttons and gray fabric patches under the armpits. I expected an all white shirt.<br />2. The pockets are shallow. You can‚Äôt fit your iPhone in them.<br />3. The pockets have a sewn down flap on top. You can‚Äôt fit your fingers in them for your keys or change.
3.0,"This shirt had the potential to be super cute, but the size ran small and it did not lay on me 5.5 145lbs well at all.  gave as a gift to a friend who is reed thin."
3.0,The discriptions says ‚Äúlarge‚Äù‚Äîbut my iPhone 8 Plus barely fits (zipper is pretty tight).
3.0,Works well to push up but the sides are much thinner than they look in the picture so it does not help with side bulge. Smaller than expected.
3.0,It nice just too small
3.0,"This could be a great credit card wallet, but it's not. The zipper is so tight it's almost impossible to open and shut without tugging when rounding the corners.  The leather is cheap and the inside card slots/pockets are either cardboard or skimpy leather backed with cardboard.  I am disappointed that this product which has excellent width (a passport easily slides into the inside pocket),many slots for credit cards, and a zipper that could have been a real help in securing contents, falls so short overall."
3.0,"The top and bottom of the cases didn‚Äôt fully align, though that could have been caused by rough shipping. They are also a little small when compared to the listed dimensions, so it‚Äôs a tight fit with my sunglasses. They are very cute, though, and true to the colors in the images."
3.0,"These are like not so great padded underwear. The sizing is strange. The material is strange. They are just a little weird. Maybe that's because they are unisex and men and women are just not built the same, especially THERE. You know what I mean?.<br /><br />Anyway, my husband is making them work, but I'm sure he'll be looking for another pair, as these are just a little too generic."
3.0,The string around the neck (which appears like a drawstring) is not adjustable so there is no way to give the chest area and slack. Disappointed in this so I am returning but it is otherwise a decent dress.
3.0,"It's cute, but it's short...not at all as pictured.  Hip length at best.  Will be returning."
3.0,They're cute but the fake septum rings were too big and fall out. Update: used pliers to make it a little smaller and they fit perfect but my friends said it wasn't me lol
3.0,"The spider is huge!!!! It's made decent material , and I will find a use for it somehow , some where,  but it's entirety too big for a necklace . It's almost 5 inches around . Maybe a barrette? A large broach for a lapel,  or sitting on a large brimmed hat , but far too big! I have large breasts, and it looks like its being smashed in there by the way it sits in my chest.  I was hoping for something a little more dainty.  Oh well."
3.0,Husband thought these were just so/so. I got them on a lightening deal so the price wasn't bad but once I got him the  Premium Big Frame Competition Swim Goggles with FREE Protective Case - EveShine Pro Clear Lens & Wide-vision Swimming Goggles with UV and Anti Fog Protection for Adult Youth Men Women he never touched these ones again.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this skirt, but the medium didn't cinch enough at the waist and made me appear wider than I am in my torso. I think overall this is just not the skirt silhouette best suited for my body shape. I'm currently wearing a size 8 or 10 (am in the midst of losing baby weight) but even before pregnancy I was always a bit thick-waisted with just a slight hourglass figure. This skirt is best suited for more a true hourglass with well defined curves"
3.0,The glasses I received do not look like the picture. They are not bad but when You're expecting one thing and get another it can be disappointing.
3.0,"Not sure this is truly style & co, was made in china and what I have bought in past was made in india.  Fit is too small and length is much shorter than in picture."
3.0,"never used it, returned it-I was looking for an under the counter unit to replace the one I had. Under the counter unit work well for many years."
3.0,"Although my son wears the same size in 501‚Äôs and this being his first pair of  Haniocal slim fit jeans they fit him a size longer in the waist and length than he would have preferred. I think they look great on him but I‚Äôm not 15yrs young!<br /> On the down side, one of the pocket rivets came off the minute he put them on. ??"
3.0,Liked everything about it except the engraving wasn't in order to make sense.
3.0,These glasses are okay there's nothing wrong with them if you are wearing them to keep the sun out for 5 dollars and some change you can't go wrong ... Not a bad deal get you a pair
3.0,"I wanted to give this coat a chance because it looks a bit plain online. Well, it looks just like it does online, so if you like this style, you will get exactly what you see.<br /><br />It is warm, it is bright. It might be fashionable with the right pieces of clothing underneath. For me, it just looks awkward. The sleeves are a bit too long for me, and even though it looks well-made, it is not flattering. I look and feel awkward in it. It gives me some static as well. I will give it a try again in the winter time and update the review if I change my mind."
3.0,Well it's very good for the price. The bad thing is the box it comes in is poorly made. It's kind of like a cardboard house.
3.0,Fabric isn't all that great.  Ordered 2 Mediums and one fits better than the other
3.0,Very tiny. Very noisy.
3.0,"My wife loved the style but after a few months the lenses started popping out. They are easily put in but just shows they are not made that well. Guess you get what you pay for. They came in a great case and she loved how dark the lenses are, plus the polarization helped her tremendously."
3.0,Love the earrings bought 3 different ones and wanted to wear them first<br />The clasp doesn't clip and unable to wear the beautiful earrings.
3.0,Not as comfortable as I expected. Not totally dissappointed but also not totally happy
3.0,"They are okay, cheaply made but it should last for the summer"
3.0,Not a true 2x more like a size large I got it on but it was like a body suit not baggy at all. Just doesn‚Äôt look good I will be sending back
3.0,"The colors are beautiful,mi lovethisress but the size does not work for me. It's to small and cut is short."
3.0,Top stone was huge compared to what I had hopes
3.0,Neck was too large
3.0,"Its a pretty shirt that fits small. I usually wear a small, but ordered a large and I am glad I did. I have not washed it yet, I don't know if it will stand up to too much washing. But overall it is pretty and I can get a few wears out of it."
3.0,"Great fabric, cut, and style, but a bit small for even junior sizes. I got a large junior since I'm a medium in women's sizes. Still too small. An extra large probably would have been perfect."
3.0,Too big for 5yrs old and too small for 12yrs old
3.0,This is a nice shoe it rub on one foot other than that it fits
3.0,"The sizing chart was not typical, so based off the reviews saying it runs small I went up a size, well they arrived and 1 size up was ok, but not perfect. The material is way too thin to be compression. I wanted them for under T'shirts, which would have been perfect because they are thin, but the seam doesn't run straight down, it curves to the front. For my overall liking these just didn't hit the mark."
3.0,Fit as expected.  Like the reviews say it's very thin material and may come across as cheap looking but for the price it's a decent play outfit you can layer to get a couple different looks.
3.0,"Light and durable. Unfortunately, the square shape makes the not fit well in some things, like my gate remote and my plastic encased car key."
3.0,Very nice material - wrong color.
3.0,"I liked them the first time I wore them, but they began to fade and lose their shine as soon as they were washed once.<br />These are definitely not &#34;sport swimwear&#34; as it says in the title.<br />They looked great out of the package, but soon faded to kind of a pale yellow that I didn't care for."
3.0,I ‚ù§the purse but the stitching is coming apart from one of the straps
3.0,fun for the money.
3.0,"good quality, but was not able to get the right size for me..."
3.0,The shorter one did not fit as well. Tighter a good swim suit cover
3.0,It broke right out the package
3.0,They work they just sit in front of my real glasses
3.0,"FABRIC IS NOT CHIFFON, IT IS CHEAPLY FINISHED PRINTED POLY.  will have to do. sigh, Good idea though. will go to the fabric store and look for better quality fabric"
3.0,"Although pretty, this is more blue and less two- toned than it appears in the photo. I like the color it added to my bracelet, and so far, it is holding up."
3.0,"I've only wore this shirt twice and I'm bored of it already. It was alright, not as good as it was depicted in the picture. The color is slightly different, material is okie. Not going to buy a second one for sure unless they improve the overall quality."
3.0,Very comfy perfect for the beach but big in the chest
3.0,"This shirt was very long and narrow. My child is 6, and very skinny, and this was too small."
3.0,Was hoping the band would be a bit larger then rhe one the watch comes with. Additionally it kept slipping out of the loops. Decided to return.
3.0,Loved it but sadly had to return it. Too large. Im 5&#34;2 113 lbs and it was falling off me.
3.0,"The top was short, more like a crop top."
3.0,Nice frames -  but had to return because it did not work for me.
3.0,Cheap material and a bit heavy.
3.0,"I bought this to replace my AE1200WH after it broke at the lug. Before that one I had an AE1000W, which is the same as the 1200WH (it just looks different). I bought this because I wanted to try a slightly cheaper watch. However, I'd go back to the AE1200WH in a heartbeat. If you have a couple extra bucks, buy an AE watch.<br />I wish I had known that F91-W's had push pins instead of spring pins. I intended on changing the strap for a NATO strap when I unboxed it, but it took a lot of effort to take them out without scratching the plastic. I could've just gotten an AE Casio. They have wide spring-loaded pins, which will make changing straps easier, and give you more strap options.<br />This watch beeps whenever you press buttons, and you can't turn it off (you can in both AE models). The built-in light doesn't really do much, while the AE models light up the whole display. AE models tell you the month. AE models also have world time, a longer stopwatch, and a timer countdown function. You can swim and take a shower with an AE and still keep your warranty. Plus, the AE1200WH looks a lot nicer than the F91-W, and I've gotten a bit of attention when I wear the AE.<br />Anyway, enough comparing this watch to the AE. The F91-W is still a great watch and tells me all I need to know at a moment's glance. Very useful for a kid with only a few bucks in his pocket who doesn't need a million features on his wrist."
3.0,The backing pads fell off immediately - I think I can make it work; a bit disappointed.
3.0,They're made well and small diameter and the tips don't come loose.. so far
3.0,too small for size order 2 sizes larger
3.0,I ordered 2 Skyblue fans.... But One of them is Black..... I need 2 Skyblue fans :(
3.0,"These shirts are made of a nice material, keeps cool, and dried quickly. The set that I received wasn't made with high standards as the seems weren't straight and the sizes varied even though they were supposed to all be the same size. They run on the small size so I would definitely order big. Works great for a spring/summer play shirt not to be worried if it gets stained or ripped."
3.0,a little too big im a size 10 and they feel like a 11
3.0,I want to start with saying I really like this crown even though it‚Äôs not what I wanted I bought it because I though it was black and red because that‚Äôs what the photo looks like (although it does say purple in the listing) it‚Äôs a very pretty crown nice weight and good over all but if your looking for a black and red crown this ain‚Äôt it it‚Äôs different shades of purple and a dark bronze almost
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äù1 and weigh 185, I‚Äôm usually size 10-11 . I ordered the XL and it was snug"
3.0,It‚Äôs more cropped than the picture looks
3.0,"The shirt closely resembles the shirt in the picture. The fabric is not what I expected at all. It looks cheap. I was expecting a cotton fabric,  but it is more of a shiney polyester material. For nearly 30 bucks I expected better quality."
3.0,"Cute pants but they definitely didn't fit true to size. I'm 5'2"" and they hit me right about my ankle bone as far as length. I'm about 125 lbs and usually wear a 4. The small was super tight in the waist and hips."
3.0,"The skirt is lovely, but I should have ordered up two sizes bigger. Ordered size medium (I'm 5'4 and 133 lbs), but the waist is tiny. It fits my 16 year old daughter well, though."
3.0,"This dress is pretty cute, but it was not as long as I expected.  It comes up above my knees and the waist fits very high up.  It does not sit at my natural waist.  I'm 5' 10"" and about 145 lbs and ordered a size Large."
3.0,"These are really cute leggings, the pattern looks identical to the popular Formation Camo at LLL. Unfortunately, the fit is all off for me. I typically wear a Large or 8/10 at Lulu so I ordered a Large in these first. When I tried them on the waist was not high enough for me to feel comfortable and the super slick material didn‚Äôt stay up. So I returned the size large and ordered an XL. I still had the same problems, waistband isn‚Äôt high enough and they continually slide down just walking around the house.<br /><br />I would say these are fine for lounging or athleisure wear but I wouldn‚Äôt wear these for a workout. They are super cute, the material feels good, soft and slick, but the fit just isn‚Äôt right for performance for me."
3.0,Good for my Dia De Los Muertos costume but that's the only time I'll ever wear it.  cheap and pretty
3.0,The waistband rolls down all the time
3.0,This is huge
3.0,I returned this.  I wanted a red bracelet and this was more burgundy/rust.  It did not look like the picture.
3.0,"The mask is nice, but the ribbon wouldn't keep it on. If it had a rubberband, or clips, that would be helpful."
3.0,Wery pure quality
3.0,Super pretty. Would give 5 stars but the bottom is unraveling...
3.0,These gloves are nice and warm but my thumb keeps sliding through the thumb hole and gets cold. I think I may just sew them shut. Other than that they are great.
3.0,the item is too small and the material is kind of cheap
3.0,Good for girls who want a little added accessory.  My daughter loves them. They are cheaply made but sufficient for a young girl.
3.0,"Cute ring, a stone fell out within the first 24 hours. I kept it but if I could redo it I would not have purchased it"
3.0,"They jewel placing is just as advertised and the quality packaging ensured that it was delivered to me in perfect condition. I am not impressed by the shine of the necklace. The jewels are not really clear/sparkly. Instead they are rather dull and there is not enough gold to make the necklace standout as much as I wanted. The necklace is also quite large in circumference to be a choker so if you have a regular/small neck, you want to have some jewelry pliers to make the necessary adjustments to it."
3.0,"I have large breasts, these made me look like I had big puffy nipples the size of a saucer. I couldn't wear them, I ended up using them as spit up/drool wipes for the diaper bag, for the car, to keep in the rock n play. So they still served a purpose, just not the one intended. The bag they came in is super cute though, I use it as a diaper bag organization bag :)"
3.0,"Got them, they are cute, post fell outüòê. I do crafts so i fixed it myself."
3.0,"Attractive but broke easily. The chain around the finger snapped quite easily. We fixed it with our jewelry skills, but it shouldn't have broken as it did."
3.0,This dress is extremely cute!  Fit perfect.
3.0,"Silver was not bright, stone was a little smaller than I expected and off color somewhat.  I purchased as a gift and was hesitant about giving and almost sent back.  However, I decided to go ahead and give.  My 11 year old granddaughter was excited and liked them, so my<br />1 and her 5 averaged to 3."
3.0,Bands do fit my versa 2. It was just weird to figure out. There are sharp edges on some of the holes that irritate me.  The buckle is cheap plastic. But they look good.
3.0,They are very difficult to set the time on.
3.0,"These are warm, but the fingers are short and wide, so they are a bit unwieldy and are hard for me to use.  I will leave them in the car for emergency gloves."
3.0,"It's cute, but there is a lot of shedding."
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE the colors, the material and the design. However, for most of my life, I have worn size Medium, so in order to have some lose roominess I ordered these T-Shirts in the X-Large size. But the X-Large size fits super snug to the point of being uncomfortably tight. TOO SMALL! There is NO roominess or breathing room."
3.0,"Order, shipped and delivered fine.  Wife did not wish posts, wanted drops, so returned at local Kohls.  No muss or fuss.  A good shopping experience but a bad choice on my part."
3.0,"Not sure why ... I have a really small wrist and haven‚Äôt had any trouble with any milanese band not fitting my wrist, but this one is about an inch too long for me.  The band itself is well made, and is as nice in person as it is in the picture, but if you have a small wrist, I would think twice before ordering it."
3.0,"For the price its stylish but the band is a poor fit , a pain to clasp it ."
3.0,it's average price and product.
3.0,I ordered XXL originally and they were way too big so sent them back and got the XL and it's too small. Maybe I'm an odd body type but I now have these shirts that I'll never wear.
3.0,Looks great on my wrist. Don't look for good luck or miracles overnight.
3.0,Was fun for vday
3.0,Runs small. and its see through.
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, about 125 lbs.  It was way too short but I do love it! It needs to be longer by at least 1-2 inches."
3.0,"It was shiny material and a knee-length dress. For a short girl like me, it was very unflattering but I could see it looking nice if you are taller. The size was appropriate"
3.0,Fair product. For the price I suppose I shouldn't have expected more
3.0,Ok for the purpose I purchased it for! Would purchase from seller again
3.0,"These are nice pants but they are not intended for people with long legs. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 140 pounds. The large was a good fit as far as the shorts part was concerned but the legs were at least 2 inches too short for me.<br /><br />Also, read that item description! The pants are plain black at the top.<br /><br />Sadly, I had to return mine due to the fit. I am giving them a mid-rating because if you do not have long legs they should be fine."
3.0,Can't complain for the price. Just a little dreary in the hardware department. I got the brown and expected more variations in the finish.
3.0,Loved it besides the diamonds all fell off right away before even 5 days. Otherwise would of been even better. Maybe super glue would work expect I lost them all too
3.0,"Regrettably, I loved the color and style, but cannot wear this shiny silky garment because it is too tight"
3.0,"The slippers fit OK but do not have a hard sole as claimed in the description. They do have a fairly thick rubber sole but anything you step on will be felt. Considering the price, they are fine but if you do wear them for an occasional trip to the mailbox you will feel all the small pebbles you step on."
3.0,"Cute vest, but runs very small. The XL is really an adult small."
3.0,"Not as impressed with these,  but i guess they are good for the price.  The abdominal panel has no reinforcement and doesn't hold you in well.  The lower half (waist down)  the spandex is great, and fits well.  The pattern is cute,  and the pants are stitched well."
3.0,It's ok if you like a semi-permanent line across your forehead and a headache.
3.0,"The pants fit as expected. I got a medium, but the shirt shows a lot more tummy than pictured. I got it as a layer so it's ok but if you're looking to wear it pictured keep in mind you have to have a certain body type to pull this look off."
3.0,"Not attractive or comfortable, sent back."
3.0,Joy con was mark with sharpie that was not on descriptions so it was disappointing to see that
3.0,Was okay just was the wrong size.
3.0,"So I felt I should be the first to review this jacket and to warn others of sizing issues . I shop a lot online and have learned to pay attention to sizing information and product fit descriptions. So I was shocked when I sized up to a large , to not only find this fit small but would describe it as an extra small . My usual size is a solid medium in athletic clothing . But to not leave out the positive ... this jacket looked sharp and appeared to be quality made. So of course I am really disappointed ."
3.0,Fun- daughter liked these socks
3.0,"This is a very pretty outfit, but the rise in the pants was too low and I had to return. There is no way I could have sat down in the pants.<br /><br />There were no labels in any of the pieces. I figured out which way to put the top on by holding it up by the shoulder seams. I couldn't tell which way the pants were supposed to go, and tried them on both ways, and they still didn't fit right. As someone noted in another comment, the top is lined with a heavish satin-like fabric. The pants are lined with another layer of chiffon. You'd have to wear nylons or spanx to smooth out any lumps or bumps in the thighs or tummy, because even though the pants fit loose, lumps and bumps will show through the fabric. Event with heels th pants were long and would need hemming<br /><br />The outfit is wrinkled out of the package. I don't know if the wrinkles would hang out after you hang it on a hanger for a while. Due to the delicate fabric, I personally would not try to iron them out. You'd probably have to take the outfit to a dry cleaner to have it pressed or dry cleaned. I'm not sure how well this outfit would travel... when packed it might wrinkle up again."
3.0,"I‚Äôm very disappointed that I says it was a sweatshirt when it actually arrived it‚Äôs a thin long sleeve shirt, when I order an item and it‚Äôs not what I actually wanted it kinda upsets me, I would have not ordered it if I would have know it wasn‚Äôt a sweatshirt, please advertise better"
3.0,"The material and comfort of this dress is great. However, the length in the front is way longer than the back. I even made sure to hang it on the hanger right from the seam. Not sure if I just got a badly stitched dress but I surely would want the length to be the same or longer in the back for those of us who have butts."
3.0,"I have a similar pair from a different company and I can tell the difference because the fabric, although stretchy, is itchy for some reason and keeps in heat. They are also irregularly matched where the top isn't long but the pants are. Almost like a petite cut top got matched with tall pants. They also run about a size smaller."
3.0,The type of camisole does not have straps like in the pictures but I will not bother returning them as they are still good. Quality is also good.
3.0,"I have an average to short torso and this suit was not 'tall' enough, the fit just wasn't right.  I wanted to love it but it was not to be."
3.0,"Tho I shoulda expected that. Take a good look at the model in the pics. How would you describe her waist, hips, and chest? Or overall figure? Does she have one? Probably, but I certainly can't tell the difference between her wearing it and a 10 year old boy wearing it. It did as much for my figure as it did for hers, the opposite of accentuated it. Ended up making me look like some frumpy soccer mom wearing some shapeless thing, which isn't really ever the look I'm going for ya understand ;) I mean, I ain't precisely voluptious by any means, but I do have curves and shape I'd prefer to have at least detectable regardless of what I'm wearing. Might do better on you, but I dunno if I'd risk it."
3.0,if has held up fine for a cheap watch.
3.0,Larger than I thought
3.0,This looks reasonably nice but is made with the cheapest polyester/ plastic blend that I have ever felt. I cant imagine it lasting more than a couple wears but functioned well as a cover up.
3.0,"I opened it the color was expected the suit very large the pants was wide leg, the material I was a little disappointed."
3.0,"The earing was a little thick so I had a ton of trouble getting it in the hole, and the product itself was a little small for my ears."
3.0,"The size is 4-7, but the length just fits my 4.5 yo. The sleeves are too tight. I have to put the elbow pads outside of the shirt. My son liked it though, so we didn't return."
3.0,Oh they are super soft but I wouldn't call them leggings more like footless thick nylons. Would be great for under a super long shirt or dress!
3.0,Didn‚Äôt fit me
3.0,"This is much larger than it appears. However, it broke as soon as I took it out of the bag."
3.0,I have a 'big' head. The one size fits all are almost always too small. This one is on the edge for size.
3.0,"They do hold my glasses in place, but they are slightly irritating to the back of my ears."
3.0,Es mas peq la talla de lo normal
3.0,"Rather cheap, good for the price."
3.0,It is a nice jacket  but it is a little  on the small  size.
3.0,Stitching around the top is a bit too tight and causes the shirt to ride up the shoulders
3.0,"Good fabric, does not fit well"
3.0,This hoodie runs short. Fits everywhere else but rides right above my waistline.
3.0,"It was a little tight on my mom, but it fit me well."
3.0,I really like the look of this bag and got lots of compliments on it but after carrying it for a month the top handle began to rip at the seams. It did not come off but I don't like to carry things that are tearing up because I don't want to get caught away from home without a bag to carry my things. I didn't feel like I was over filling it with stuff. I just put my typical things in it like I do every purse I carry.
3.0,"I am a DD and this bathing suit is loose in that area which I have never experienced.  In addition, I made the straps as tight as they will go and they were still loose once I got in the water.  It is a nice suit, but I am not sure if I would say it is just not true to size or if it is cut weird.  The fit for the rest of suit is good which makes me feel the suit is just sized weird."
3.0,La verdad es bonito pero lo que no me gusta que no tiene forro y la verdad yo me siento muy incomoda cuando los vestidos son as√≠. Y esta muy reducido la talla me quedo chico.
3.0,"They are a nice size and will work for covering up in the dirt. The printed design is just what you would expect based upon the price. I can't sew seams along edges, so purchasing a bunch of these was the next step up from cutting and sewing my own."
3.0,"The top has no structure and is unwearable. I'm not well endowed, but the top wasn't flattering at all. Pretty pattern, so I switched the top out and wore the bottoms with another top. Make sure to check the sizing chart, because it runs EXTREMELY small."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Nice look though..
3.0,I'm 5'9  and the shirt is too short in the torso.
3.0,I thought it was larger. But this bracelet is nice for a young girl.
3.0,The bracelet was adorable but it arrived in an empty box. üò¨. Amazon re-sent it.
3.0,"The lens doesn't have a gradient. They're simply shaded. The size and fit is great. Will have to wear them a few days to see if they'll do indoors. At first impression, they're very dark."
3.0,The fit over my glasses is loose but it works. Try a snap back.
3.0,Too big and not adjustable.  Took a long time to get delivered
3.0,"If you have short fingers you may be happy with these. I got these for a Halloween costume and the quality is good, however, as usual (for me) the fingers are too short :("
3.0,Looking and wearing very nice. but it is very very sensitive to wear and my wife like this.. This is we can do only on occasionally with careful during wearing itself not on everyday.
3.0,"I mean... it‚Äôs a super pretty color but the crotch is crazy long like they are expecting me to have extra parts down there or something. The padding is... ridiculous .<br />I honestly can‚Äôt really even describe it it‚Äôs that stupid and weirdly placed.<br />But I‚Äôll try!<br />It‚Äôs kind of like if Jessica Rabbit was a Drag Queen and she ordered a bodysuit designed to her specifications.<br />If you have a small frame and boobs smaller than a D , do not buy this unless it‚Äôs for a Drag Ball or something."
3.0,I returned. Nice looking but not a good fit for me.
3.0,There is a tacky stripe down the side of the grey pair.  The photos don‚Äôt show that.
3.0,Tight on the face
3.0,"Pretty, and arrived on time"
3.0,"I got this for my father and the first thing he noticed was that this is a summer pant or spring, due to the light material. He liked the color, and said it was ""brilliant."" The pants are very long. He is almost 6 feet tall but they still have to be shortened. The waist was loose on his 32 inch waist but he says he can adjust with a belt. He is going to wear it in the spring and is overall happy with it."
3.0,Broke in a week...
3.0,"Size 6 is a little long and big for me ( 5.2 ft, 130 lb)"
3.0,came in fast .... it was thinner then I thought it would be fit a bit snug the colors seemed darker then the picture ....but still cute i wear with leggings and seems to work out ok
3.0,I had bought the L and it was too large. Gave it away as a present. Bought the S/M and it ran small. Those 2-size items ate always a pain.
3.0,"Dress was cute, and seemed good quality at first. But it is extremely delicate. After just a few washes, the fabric started to pill, and the lace got absolutely shredded on the one day I wore the dress out while wearing a purse."
3.0,I love this blanket with the hoodie and it‚Äôs so cute! I love nezuko so I had to get this! Only thing that‚Äôs suck was when I washed it some of the threading were coming off which makes me sad but other than that I love it!
3.0,"The ear ring is really nice and is exactly how it looks from the picture but when I tried it on, it is too big and awkward for my ear. It's not stable and keeps falling off. There's also nothing that could help attach it the ear on the upper part of the dragon which is what causes it to fall off. Overall, it's nice to look at but disappointing that I can't wear it unless I alter it in some way..."
3.0,"The size is reasonable, not oversized nor too small.  I bought it to have an everyday bag when I travel.  I like that I can pack it easily.  It seems well made but I wish it had a longer handle to hang on my shoulder, since I'm not a big fan of the crossover bag.  Not for me - so I'll just give it away."
3.0,Fit was smaller than expected.  Order one or two sizes larger.
3.0,"I was expecting that for the price of $150 it would look perfect but there were threads uncut which was a disappointment. I am still getting used to wearing them for work. I do a lot of walking and standing, though I have observed that during the first day, my knees weren't as painful as it use to be. Should've read the reviews before my actual purchase, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. I am just hoping that it delivers what they say in their ads"
3.0,It's not the same ring as the picture but they get pretty close. but over all it's a pretty ring.
3.0,"original add says it is made in Italy, but actually it is made in China"
3.0,So much better than the sun!  The head part could be a little more comfortable though. Its a good buy.
3.0,"Cute, but runs small and short. My measurements are 34-28-37. I struggled to put it on because the material is not stretchy. I recommend sizing up."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:39c115fcd39975905c95a9281a7ded6f]] Not bad for the price but really wanted mostly a cute lavender band. It doesn‚Äôt look like the picture, it‚Äôs more of a gray/taupe."
3.0,I wish it had a zipper compartment inside the top of the suitcase.  I was not able to see this on the website.  Also it took way too long for me to receive it.  I think there was a problem with the order and they did not discover it until I made them aware that I had not received it by the due date.
3.0,Very pretty not the best clarity but a great gift for a teenager
3.0,"These gloves are sized for very small adult forearms and hands, and do not stretch at all. They include a slit at each wrist, and three buttons to close it, but I was not able to around my small wrists. The metallic fabric is very shiny, and complements other metallic costume items well."
3.0,"Meh, this was nothing special. I‚Äôm fairly flat chested so I expected this to work better than it did. It is super sticky, but the corners began to lift immediately. It doesn‚Äôt offer any support whatsoever, I‚Äôd rather use a bra with a clear back strap then this in the future."
3.0,If someone picks up wallet the first thing they will do loose the chip.
3.0,Not sure why but I expected the bag to be a bit larger.
3.0,The watch is cute and it would be a nice product but the clasp is weak and broke the second time I wore it. The complimentary bracelet is fairly nice and seems a lot sturdier than the watch
3.0,"This dress is surprisingly well made with straight seams on the sides. The length is perfect especially for a 5'4"" woman aged over 60. It's actually flattering and doesn't hang like drape. My only complaint is the misleading description. The fabric is NOT cotton but viscose and must be hand washed and line dried. I have no idea how many washings I'll get out of it before it pills up but if I get one summer's use out of it, it will be worth it for the price."
3.0,This hat is very very small. The quality  is good but it's just very very small.
3.0,"Light weight, not so much sturdy or durable. The inside material tore right away. The zipper gets caught."
3.0,"I think it is a woman‚Äôs xl Not a mens it is a little small, plus the zipper is on the wrong side."
3.0,Pro‚Äôs:<br /> It‚Äôs a soft beanie. Nice blue color.<br />The headlamp is relatively easy to turn on. You just press the middle black button.<br />It has 3 settings and is quite bright. It lit up my entire room.<br /><br />Con‚Äôs:<br />The Bluetooth speakers rest on either side and are a bit bulky. It makes the hat not as comfortable.<br />The power cord l sticks out on mine  too which I know if that was just faulty or not.
3.0,Well made just the fit is way off.
3.0,only had the bottom and top not the collar etc
3.0,"Es muy lindo, pero desde que llego ten√≠a un hoyo en el pez dorado y lo he usado un mes y el dorado se ha decolorado considerablemente"
3.0,"Nice , but you get what you pay for !!"
3.0,My husband said they were too bulky he found another brand he liked better that allowed more movement and were not so much padding but still keeps hands dry and warm.
3.0,"I really like this type of stretchy, sporty band for my Fitbit. I've used something similar to this with my Versa 2 for a couple of years and love it. I recently upgraded to a Versa 4, so I ordered these bands to wear with it. They are nice and stretchy, adjustable, and should fit any size wrist.<br /><br />BUT.... the material of these bands is different than what I've been using, and that is not a good thing. These bands irritate my skin, and I find myself taking off the Fitbit from time to time just to get relief from it.  That is not because the band is on too tight. There is something in the fabric that irritates my skin. Nylon? My skin is sensitive, I must use latex free bandages in order to avoid a rash, and I'm careful about any moisturizer I put on my face. I have also had issues with the band that typically comes with the Fitbitd devices, part of the reason I order different bands.<br /><br />With the Versa 4 I actually find the Fitbit band that comes with it to be more comfortable than this stretchy band. I definitely would not order these again."
3.0,"First, the pajama top and bottom fit perfect, but the bra top was awkward.  Probably an a cup size ... I'm a ddd, so I returned."
3.0,It is smaller
3.0,"La descripcion del producto exacta, pero no soporta el peso que dice, al principio funciono bien, pero al poco tiempo se da√±o"
3.0,Very pretty but very small
3.0,Ok but frustrating to use
3.0,The ID two window is very loose and feels like it could come apart at anytime.
3.0,This came VERY tarnished. Not Shiney at all! Disappointed in this Christmas gift!
3.0,Color was great and as advertised but the material was shiny. Not what I expected. Returned. The sheen made it feel like I was wearing a sports jersey.
3.0,"I liked the material,but they were way way too long and now I wonder what how would  a size medium  fit."
3.0,"This coverup is cute, but the hood make us pull toward the back and I don‚Äôt like how it strangles me."
3.0,I really like this shirt. But I will not come wrinkle free. The material this is made from makes it so you cannot iron it. I followed the washing instructions. So this will be a shirt used only for fishing. Nice shirt though.
3.0,"Quality is okay. I hadn't realized the pendant swung (my own fault). It's a lot bigger than expected so I won't wear it, but it's hanging up in my office for decoration."
3.0,"Sized wrong , medium-sized was like an extra large had to return"
3.0,Although I did like this watch visually I had to return it because the face of the watch (size) was too small to read.
3.0,Nicely made just a little big for small woman
3.0,This material is so soft. The dress is a tad bit too bit. The sleeve are quite long the length needs to be altered. Beautiful colour as pictured. Fit wasnt that great though.
3.0,"I bought these shoes directly from Blowfish.com. The style was exactly what I have been looking for in a street shoe for some time. I am normally closer to a size 10.5 but can fit into many size 10 shoes. I bought, however a size 11 to be safe and my toes are still at the very end. I've been looking for reviews as to how they break in, but haven't found any.  I haven't decided if I should return them or try to break them in. I would be bummed to be out $50."
3.0,"This product runs small, I had to return it"
3.0,The product is presented for sale with 6 filters but was delivered with only 2 filters
3.0,fabric is very thin and see through
3.0,"Im giving this item 4 starts because of the color, i hate it. it looks nothing like the one in the picture. It's really ugly"
3.0,Good. My wife likes it
3.0,I bought this bag for.my son's upcoming wedding and I really like it but it has a terrible odor and I don't know if it will dissipate in time for the wedding!
3.0,"Decent item considering the price, however one strap has a twist in it that can't be corrected so the strap doesn't lay flat when worn."
3.0,They look so cute amazing color.<br />It‚Äôs too bad they run a bit small.
3.0,I like this bag but certainly do not consider it oversized.  Wish I went with something else as i was looking for something that would carry more.
3.0,The blue mirror lenses are very nice but they are HUGE!  I obviously need to brush up on my &#34;metric&#34; skills because the description gave the lens size in mm but I had no concept of what that would look like.  I should have got out a ruler with metric on it so I'd have had a better idea of how large that was.  They came with a nice little bag and the seller sent them well packaged.  They were just much larger on the face than I anticipated.
3.0,"Love these bracelets but these particular ones are not of the highest quality. Although, for the price I did not expect for them to be. Much flimsier than the real bracelets that cost much more."
3.0,It happens
3.0,"I like the shape and color of the sunglasses, however, the frame of the glasses is too big for my head.  The glasses slide down my nose."
3.0,"It Smells, even after I washed it."
3.0,Cute dress way larger than expecting!
3.0,"While this robe is simply lovely and I absolutely love the feel of the fabric, it is made for a slimmer woman. I am 5'3&#34; and weigh about 170. I'm keeping it and hopefully I'll slim down enough to close it up properly."
3.0,"I ordered a small as I am 5'4&#34; 128# 34ddd and the top half fit well but the bottom hung too loose for me.  Its super cute, though."
3.0,The earring shipped in record time and it is a pretty piece of jewelry but I ordered it thinking it was sterling silver because that's all that my daughter can wear. The website bolstered that it was sterling silver but its not. It also came with no back for the earring so I had to scramble and find a back.
3.0,Incredibly hard to put on and the holes are too small for the clasp to go in.  cheaply made. What's with all the great reviews??<br /><br />Edit*<br />I added 2 more stars mainly because the seller contacted me back to replace it with a new one. I didn't need it as I had fixed it myself with a leather puncher to make the hole wider. For the price it's expected but I appreciate the seller for contacting me
3.0,"My son is 5yrs old, I got the largest they have and they are kind of tight. I love them but it makes me wonder how long they will fit. They are VERY VERY cute. The lasted 6months. And fell right apart."
3.0,I thought it would be a bit more bigger in size. t's ok.
3.0,"These run so small its crazy!  I am usually and extra small or small but I would need a medium in these for them to be comfortable.  I am 5'2"" and 120 lbs and I ordered and xs first and I could barely get them on the waist band was crazy tight!  I ended up trying a small but they are still tighter than I'd like and leaning over on a bike still squeezes my waist like crazy.  The quality is good though but I doubt these would fit anyone that normally wears anything larger than a medium even if they order a large!"
3.0,"Compliments when wearing this! It‚Äôs comfortable, love it. But unwearable after just 3 cleanings. Please redo it in better quality fabric."
3.0,Scarf looks like it came from the dollar tree.
3.0,Don‚Äôt know that it will last very long I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt cost more than it did also make sure you order at least two sizes Bigger than what you need because the sizing chart is way off.
3.0,Very tiny words { Name }
3.0,not too bad. too narrow around the calf
3.0,"These are everyday reading glasses, no frills, no style.  But they do what they are supposed to do. They fit well and because of the price I do not have to be too careful with them."
3.0,Much longer than this picture. Fits like a dress.
3.0,"The color was beautiful. Material decent, nice dress overall. I am consistently a small/xs (2/4) in clothes. I ordered a small without looking at the measurements since it says 4/6. I could have worn it possibly but it was SO tight. I went back and ordered a medium which did fit better but was then longer than I wanted. I would warn do NOT go by size, go by measurements listed. Their measurements put me between a medium and large. I ended up returning after I found a dress I liked better. Overall a pretty dress, just be cautious of sizing."
3.0,My calfs are quite thick so the compression is more than I need there. However my show size is 8 so IAM missing the diabetic strip around the arch. These won't keep your feet warm either. Which is fine with me
3.0,"Dress is nice ,looks like the pictures but the material at the bottom of the dress is a little cheap feeling.  Don't get me wrong it looks ok on ,no problems with the fit. They just could have used a bit nicer fabric.  All in all for the price go for it . Only other criticism is the zipper is on your side under your arm so you may need help zipping it."
3.0,they roll soooo bad it's not even funny. i have some pretty thick thighs but i didn't think it was that bad. i even got the plus sized ones T^T
3.0,"Thin off white,  old fashioned looking sweater. No tags"
3.0,"It's absolutely beautiful.  However, the first thing that happened out of the package is backing to the rose feel off.  The rose itself was poorly glued on.  I have attempted to fix it with stronger glue, it's fallen off twice now.  But I do love it and the matching necklace."
3.0,"These shorts are ok. The fit is as expected. The material they are made of is relatively stiff and not super comfortable on the skin, but that could potentially change with a few washes. They are a great price for those of us that are budget conscious."
3.0,It's not long enough and the collar is bigger than expected. Very light shirt. Works well on the beach or canoeing.
3.0,"my wife loves them, but I put them on her the first time and bent the shaft almost sideways before i know it. so that's why I gave them only 3 stars"
3.0,"I ordered a 2XL and it fits like a XL. I double checked the order and I did order 2XL and the inside of the shirts says 2XL but it doesn't fit properly. I have not washed them yet I tried it on to see if they fit and for the feel and found out that it is too small for the size ordered. Other than that, they do feel comfortable and are pretty smooth."
3.0,The gold part of the earring turns very quickly. After my first wear of them. Cute when u first get them though.
3.0,"Not as well made as I would like it to be, it's cute,  but I ended giving it to my much younger daughter."
3.0,I love it and my boyfriend loved it the only problem was the length but I am 6 foot so I expected it to be kind of tight.
3.0,I love the style and color but it's clearly meant for petite. 30in inseam is not acceptable for ladies taller than 5'5&#34;
3.0,The skirt is see through. I didn't realize that so I had to return it.
3.0,"These are super cute! But after my daughter wore for only 2 hrs at an indoor water park, the soles were coming out as she was walking. I kept having to replace it. True to size."
3.0,"I ordered my normal size and the set fit just fine, not too short, has amazing stretch, giving 90s clueless vibes!"
3.0,Used for a dance performance.
3.0,Band was to small. Fitbit small fits me but this small was equivalent to a kids small wrist. Very disappointed.
3.0,Socks are inconsistent within the size. I ordered L/Xl and some pairs are harder to get on. I noticed the ones that are hard to get on are half the size (width) than the others. The smaller ones I‚Äôm not able to pull up as high. The ones that fit properly are comfy to wear.
3.0,"I've found it to be a huge struggle to find soft tunnels that are inexpensive but comfortable. These are inexpensive, but I am disappointed that they aren't as soft as I was hoping they would be. If you're looking for inexpensive, these are a good value. If you're looking for Kaos quality tunnels for a lower price, these miss the mark by a good margin."
3.0,"These are the cutest and look awesome on the foot but run small,  had to reorder in larger size and the big toe still was hitting the shoe uncomfortably,  never had that problem before.  Will keep and try to make work because they really are so cute."
3.0,the material is cheap and the dress runs both small and short
3.0,Even though it is smaller than I hoped I can use it as a clutch instead
3.0,"I'm a very small person (5'1"" - 130 lbs - bust 36) The small was small even for my shoulders and I could tell, if I accidently put it in the dryer even once, I fear it'd be much too tight. But also the inner lining on the collar didn't go low enough. With the zipper all the way down, you could very easily see the stitching of the lining to the garment itself."
3.0,"The band seams to have good quality and is genuine leather. But color and texture are quite different from the pictures in the description. the band is less rugged an more ""reddish"", not what I was expecting based on the pictures shown in the product description."
3.0,Received this dress ‚Ä¶and I am shocked it even made to be delivered given the packaging.<br />It was in a clear zip bag similar to a freezer zip lokck bag‚Ä¶you could see the dress inside and the bag was not sealed up.<br />I like the dress‚Ä¶but the packaging it is shipped in is unacceptable.
3.0,The details of the art work is pitiful and the bleed. I was very disappointed that the women in the pictures were not black.
3.0,Not as good looking as in the picture
3.0,"The glass orb is beautiful, only problem we had was the necklace was too short  and would not go over my 13yo niece‚Äôs head. I had to cut the rope and buy another necklace so she could wear it. She is very pleased with her gift."
3.0,one of the screws on the left side came out so i have to adjust it ever so often. kinda annoying thinking this would be a little bit durable to last more then a week.
3.0,Extremely tight fit. Almost uncomfortable.
3.0,Love the T but it‚Äôs short and I am short waisted.
3.0,I like that they make my butt look great. They are comfy even on hot days.<br /><br />I do have big thighs so the medium does cut into them at times. But my waist is small so the large fits big.<br />I bought these based on an IG fitness account I follow and they made them look great. I was not able to get the shorts I wanted from gym shark bc they sold out and these are more affordable.<br />My measurements are<br />waist: 30in.<br />Hips: 43 in<br />Each thigh around is 21 in.
3.0,Not as full and fluffy as I was hoping but will have to work no time to order a new one. Fits well.
3.0,Needed something ive never before to wdw for my bday. These shiny plastic pants got attention! Lol. This is a large. They stretch and growwww lol. By end of night the inner legs rubbed off the finish sadly. They are a pinky rose not gold but matched my shirt and accessories perfectly.
3.0,"I am a size 8, pretty true, I ordered a size medium, it fits perfectly right as shapewear should , I have the version with the ‚Äúbutt flap‚Äù thing and I think it‚Äôs kinda pointless, I have a pretty small butt and it does not come down far enough for me to use the restroom at all, also it leaves a weird crease where the fabric overlaps that wouldn‚Äôt look cute if you were wearing a tight top or dress, it‚Äôs fine for what it is and I would definitely recommend to someone who‚Äôs just looking for something comfy to wear with pants or shorts, just not every day wear cause you have to completely peel it off to go potty"
3.0,Very lightweight and comfortable.  Should last a long time with some care.
3.0,"My grand-daughter wears a girls size 3 in other shoes, but these were big for a 3. Maybe need to re-size them. She';; grow into them eventually."
3.0,"Definitely runs small. Sleeves are short on my arms. The &#34;white&#34; is not white, it's very much cream. Cute, soft, and lightweight."
3.0,Was smaller than anticipated. Mini is an understatement. I'm only 5'4 and will need to wear leggings under it.
3.0,"This was a gift for my daughter. She loved it. The only problem is that it gets tangled a lot. Other than that, it‚Äôs perfect."
3.0,"I guess it was alright, but it was way to hot for me."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter. It seems like a pretty decent necklace, but what we received is not what is pictured here. I've taken off 2 stars since the necklace is not as advertised. There are other sellers selling necklaces like the one we received for no more than half of this price."
3.0,"It was comfortable and really soft. But it was too big,that I have to have it altered so it will fit on me."
3.0,The dress is nice but i was sent the wrong color dress.I dont like the color that was sent. It didnt fit the color scheme for my event
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 140 lbs. was longer than expected. I would size down!! The straps are adjustable so that helps. Wish I would have gotten a small not a medium!! Over all great purchase!!
3.0,Just arrived today and it does fit my 3 plus hybrid. 3 stars because one of the gems is missing. It is still a very pretty band and it is easy to remove the links. I will try to update after I have used the band for a while to see how well it wears.
3.0,Didn't pay much so can't complain but wish it would come with instructions and stay on longer than a couple of seconds.
3.0,very cute but if you're looking to wear as a dress too short in the front
3.0,"The prints on the shirts are not as pictured but are close, they are not as bright and fashionable as suggested but they are ok for a child. The photo would also suggest by the Gloss that these are not 100% cotton shirts as (now) clearly updated as the main description, The Prints on them are also not high gloss prints they are press on barely noticeable stickers, these are knock off shirts, they also barly cover a 3 year old's waist line  On this shirt it was not a blue background by a red one. To say the least these are knock offs and you would be wise to save your money and move on to another item."
3.0,Bought the 2 pack. Case is beautiful I love the design but the second case (the purple one) came bent and it doesn‚Äôt close correctly. Other than that if it didn‚Äôt come bent I would have been very happy with this purchase.
3.0,"It is beautiful. But the reason i gave only 3 stars is because the brooch pendant is stuck on upside-down, which makes it look like Satan Sailor Moon. Then the inside, while pretty pink, was not what was shown on the picture advertised. I know im buying a knock off but im still paying for what should be shown in the pictures."
3.0,it looks cool but after awhile of wearing it looks too try hard. get a better ring guys!
3.0,Buy one size bigger than normal
3.0,Medium fits like Large
3.0,Break kind of easily especially when its cold. Works well for its intended purpose though.  I would recommend this item just be careful if you leave your car outside in the winter.
3.0,I was looking for sleeveless bodysuits for my newborn girl. I looked for other ones but they were all with sleeves. because of the price I ordered a set and got them. I was disappointed because the sizing is not accurate at all. I think those were bigger than their age. one of the pieces had a small area near the neck that is detached and it really looked like it was poor quality. I have not used them yet. so i don't know how they fit or what happens to them after several washes.
3.0,"Nice and not tiny, but like the others said, this has an extremely thick wire gauge to the point where they were almost unwearable."
3.0,Huge for a 3xl no need to buy a bigger size get your size.
3.0,Slots in wallet too tight.
3.0,"I wanted to love this, but it was way too big with no support what so ever. It was an awkward fit where the bottom was too loose and your boobs poke out. It is really pretty. Perhaps if I chose a size smaller."
3.0,They‚Äôre 1 size smaller than you think ü§î<br />Be aware of that when you order. I wasted my money!üôÑ
3.0,Got an xl when normally a large fits. The jacket is VERY small. Order a couple sizes bigger unless you like skin tight jackets
3.0,liked color most
3.0,The colors are beautiful but too bad it‚Äôs big and loose for a 4 years old.
3.0,"Ordered a Large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 38C and 160 Ibs. I<br />can button it but it pulls open at buttons so badly I cannot wear it. The material is nice kind of a mix between a Jersey and polyester fabric."
3.0,Super cute - looks exactly like the picture.  Problem with the tail getting caught on edges and unraveling while on your finger.  Maybe selective wearing where you won't be doing any hand intensive work.  It's a fun ring to wear and comfortable to fit on any size finger.
3.0,"Seemed well made, color was as advertised, but I ordered a size up for my daughter and they were too small."
3.0,I bought these for my mom who always wears a size 9. Very nice boots. Loved them except they ran a bit small. My aunt who wears a size 8 1/2 really liked them and they fit her. She kept the boots.
3.0,"Five days after my niece opened her watch, it quit working."
3.0,Was not true to size. Was easier to give to a family member in need than to return. Excellent product though. The family member loves it. Ordered a 6x did not fit as a 6 but did fit a 3x comfortably.
3.0,"I purchased three pairs of cloud/pillow slippers from three different sellers.  This was necessary to cover the color and size selections required.  I got the welltree brand, and mine are NOT nearly as soft as the two other brands purchased for other family members.  I am disappointed."
3.0,"I was hoping that this could be a basic, everyday bracelet that I could layer with my other simple silver bracelets.  However, it looks very bland...the surface is matte and from afar, it has the appearance of rumpled tinfoil.  In the end, it didn't coordinate well at all with my other bracelets that are sterling silver.  That being said, for the right person, this is a good bracelet.  The quality is good and it has a nice smooth ""stretch"" to it when you're pulling it off and on."
3.0,This isn't a Mj&ouml;lnir its a ax head I thought it was
3.0,it a little stiff
3.0,"My daughter loved this bag and had to have it. She has used it off and on this summer and the lining has torn. It‚Äôs very cute and it looks just like the picture, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,I haven't used it; maybe come winter!
3.0,I've got bigger ankles and they hurt by the end of the day.  I would not reccommend for guys with bigger ankles.
3.0,"I got my size based on the reviews. I am 5'7 and 200 pounds and it looked weird, friends. The torso was short giving me the dreaded camel toe and the fabric was tight on my hips, but surprisingly fit on my legs. Also, if you are big chested, unless you want your boobs falling out, don't get this.<br /><br />Overall, cute idea but not a good look if you are a bigger woman."
3.0,"First off, I do like this cardigan and I wear it often. The fit is definitely one of those off the shoulder cozy types of sweaters, meaning it barely stays up on my shoulders. I enjoy that and feel sexy in it, but if you were looking for something to stay on this isn't it. The length is another issue. The back is shorter than the front when wearing it. The front is long (goes past the waist/upper thighs) and hits in a nice place, but the back is shorter and hit just at the top of the butt. Weird! It looks kinda funny from the side when you can see the low-high effect front to back. All that to say, I do like this sweater, but there might be something better out there without the wonky shape."
3.0,"I have an athletic body type - 135 lbs. 5'4&#34; - so instead of a medium I bought one size up, and it fits snug around my ribcage. I usually wear bra size 38D, and I didn't know if the top half sometimes sliding off of my chest to one side meant it was too big or too small. It especially will slide with sharp movements - the chest parts all also VERY TRANSPARENT, so I would not recommend for an outer event nor a club unless you have pasties handy, but at home with the boyfriend, it's a cute little treat for the both of you on date night."
3.0,"This runs small really small, but it's a great shirt and decent stitching"
3.0,"Love these jeans, but way too snug and cannot wear.<br />If you take a size or two smaller, then they will be perfect for you.<br />Nice material, great color, perfect length.<br />I'm so bummed I can't stretch them out enough to wear."
3.0,"Ok, First of all it is a really cute bathing suit. Came just as pictured. The top is ADORABLE and fits just like I thought it would. I normally wear an 18 so I got the xxl because of other reviews. Like I said, top fits great, even has great support in the chest area. However, the shorts that were sent with the suit were a size Large...imagine my surprise when I tried to squeeze into those puppies. the package it came together in said XXL but I looked at the tag in the shorts after I tried them on and it said L. My advice would be buyer beware, just know what your getting into. I'm not going to bother to return it because the top is too cute, I'll just give the swim shorts to my daughter and look for separate shorts to buy."
3.0,It seemed like it would be a great idea but unfortunately didn't fit my 15 year old son's head.  We passed it on to a younger child.  Disappointing.
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt fit or look like the picture. Look cheaply made material and has one pocket in odd location. This is very thin will need a shirt underneath. Not nearly as long as in the picture. I know I‚Äôm y‚Äôall (6‚Äô1‚Äù) but only came to my butt. Very disappointed.
3.0,"The quality of this tie wasn't the best, but if you're looking for an option for a few uses or a special occasion it's good."
3.0,"It fits and it's comfortable, but super long! I'm 5'1 and it almost reaches down to my knees. It looks and feels more like a t-shirt. I guess I'll be wearing leggings with this now. Lol"
3.0,"While the material is soft, the pjs are entirely too small. I normally wear a large but ordered an extra large for a bit more room. This fits tight. Almost like a medium."
3.0,"Fitz's expected very comfortable, love the pockets, not very soft at all. Fabric is itchy and stiff on the outside but soft enough on the inside. Not the best, not the greatest, not too bad, I give it a 3 out of 5"
3.0,The picture is a red white and blue emblem but when I received it it was black. But it was still acceptable for me.
3.0,It has begun to tarnish. I'm pretty sure it's silver plated
3.0,It‚Äôs not true to size
3.0,"I gave these glasses a 3 because they are pretty cute, but they are kind of large. I am a female with a small/medium build and these just didn't really work for me. They aren't horrible but I haven't decided if I am wearing them out in public yet. Had I tried these on at a store I probably wouldn't have purchased them based on their size alone. The color is great and they would be really nice if they were just a bit smaller."
3.0,Good for that price.
3.0,So cute and everyone loves it! Unfortunately the zipper split after the return window closed and it‚Äôs no longer functional. Will have to donate to Goodwill.
3.0,The colors displayed are not the same as what‚Äôs delivered.
3.0,"The bra is very pretty however, the fit wasn‚Äôt good for me. The band was tighter then others in the same size and the wires were so high they extended into my armpits. It was extremely uncomfortable for me but might work for other body types."
3.0,Size down. Nice shirt just runs large
3.0,"I wore them for about a week. My feet hurt more after I wore them. They are not soft and cushiony. They are well made for whatever that is worth.<br /><br />* I just upgraded them from 2 stars to 3 after having them for a few months. I now wear compression socks underneath a pair of regular socks. This provides enough cushioning that the firmness of the slipper is less of a problem. And, like I said, they are very well made."
3.0,I like the style of the skirt but the color is kind of faded.
3.0,Nice feel but no fly.
3.0,"Love the color, love the thumb holes, I am a size 2x, ordered a 3x because I wanted the baggy fit for the look I want with this sweatshirt and it‚Äôs fits more like a 2x. I like the feel of it, just wish it was a true 3x size."
3.0,I like Chicwe clothes. This one is nice but the fabric is less forgiving than others.
3.0,"I have ordered many items from Allegra K. Size xsmall has always worked for me except this one. It is small around chest and waist. Length is perfect. The material is very soft to touch. The color is just like the picture. Just wish I have ordered one size up. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 108lbs."
3.0,it is kind of expensive for a chain that rusts after use for several days. other than that it is ok.
3.0,"Just received this today, and after putting it on and opening the pockets, the inside left velcro pocket stitches were coming undone. I'm a little worried that the rest of the stitching won't hold up either.  It fits well as a small and I'm 5'11"" and 160."
3.0,"Pretty rings but several of them broke when I tried moving them around, a few others appeared dirty when I received them."
3.0,Very cheaply made. They look cheap
3.0,The material is very thin. I hope it makes it through a laundry cycle.
3.0,"Like others have said, the headband is a big pain! The band will always slide down on your head until the camera starts resting on your ear which got really painful after 20 minuets. The mount also ends up pointing the camera towards the sky. But it can be fixed! I took another strap measured and cut it to my desire and then sewn it to run over my head on both sides of the head band. Now the camera will not sag, holds position very well and adds A TON of stabilization. No more wobble. A necessary and very well modification :) Will post pictures of this. Check them out in the image section for the item listing."
3.0,Se ajusta a la calidad con el precio
3.0,"Nice, but it is thinner than what it looks like in the picture.  My son loves it, so I guess it is very good value for the money."
3.0,"one the bands broke a few days after I purchased it, still pretty though"
3.0,Product fit perfectly but too short in length for me die not go down to ankles... I am 5ft 7in
3.0,Not that bad..
3.0,"They are ok for the price but I ended up having a few break within the first few days of using them. Cheaply made but holds up well in places that dont get much activity around, such as ears, but not face."
3.0,Very cute but the top part is too big that even showed my bra.
3.0,I usually wear a low impact sports bra/bralette for yoga. It has to be comfortable and movable. I boguht the Regular S-L size. They are way too big. I'm a size 36C/34D and the bra doesn't give any support. They stretch out easily and sag in the front. They are comfortable to wear with a sweatshirt to run errands or around the house but not for yoga or any other light activity. Sizes S-L shouldn't be the same size. Kinda disappointed with these but kept them to wear around lounging.
3.0,"Bands seem well made and fasten securely‚Äî-<br />HOWEVER, both are loose where they attach to Apple Watch causing a great potential for clothing snags!  Disappointing"
3.0,Rubber pealed off very quickly. Lost the piece by the ear then eventually the nose.
3.0,"Ok, so it came today, We ordered the SnowWhite one, in a 2X. My daughter tried it on and it fit perfect bodicewise, lengthwise, and she loved it. Only problem... the arms. Her arms are also 2X. The gold strip, was way too tight. She cried. Good thing is we still have time (halloween is 5 weeks away) to figure something outü•∫. But, none the less, as always, AMAZON IS MY HERO! Returning it is going to be fast/free‚ô•Ô∏é"
3.0,"When you wear this dress, it makes you look like you've gained 5 pounds.<br />The lower part of the dress, it's not the same as the picture. The bottom part of the dress in the picture is stiff, but in fact the hem is very soft and the texture is not good."
3.0,LIKE STYLE OF BOOT.
3.0,"Got this for my son and he loves it. However he did not get the filter that was suppose to have received with it to keep out the germs. Imm having a hard time trying to obtain this and im frustrated,  especially seeing how this was why it costed me so much in the first place, right???? Someone please help me get my filter thats supposed to be reusable for him.  Thank you :)"
3.0,"So these took a week to get to me even though it was prime 2 days shipping. So that was a bummer. They are all really nice looking but they are different sizes as well. The blue and the clear one are too big for my nose, I look like a bull, but the pink one is smaller than they are and fit okay. Also it is not the same color as shown. It is a very light pink. The blue is really pretty irl though and I wish it wasn't so big."
3.0,THEY RUN VERY SMALL
3.0,The dress it‚Äôs way to small for an XL
3.0,Some of these earrings are really cute and then some of them are kinda faded. Otherwise a great purchase.
3.0,Nice for the price.  Fit is good shipping took forever.
3.0,"Pretty okay and comfortable for lounging around the house, but if you're a halfway decent size, anywhere close to DD cup, don't ever consider doing anything more than a strolling, ambling walk wearing a sports bra. Does fine for work and hanging out around the house, but I'll stick with my high impact extra support VS sports bra for exercise"
3.0,I usually wear a large and I carry my weight in my hip area.  I read the reviews and decided to order a 3x....they are still snug in the waist area.  I still lounge around the house in them because they feel so good against the skin.  I would advise you to go up 3 or 4 sizes and if you carry a lot of weight in your waist area....then you will probably be disappointed.
3.0,"The bag fits a lot of items, the should strap is awkward so I just use the handles, I prefer my raider duffle bag!"
3.0,Does not have a bulb at the end to help keep in place...comes out of the nose very easily
3.0,Just seem to he cheaply made and not what I expected. Would not recommend.
3.0,"It's not eggshell/cream color as pictured, but bright white!!  I have plans for it though.  Will def wear as a shirt and not a dress though, unless I buy a white spandex dress to  wear underneath....you can see straight through this number!!  Will probably look cute as a tunic with some jeans and white cami underneath"
3.0,"The belt is cute, but the quality is not great. When it first arrived, I opened the package and immediately tried it on. It looked cute and fit well. The first thing I noticed is that the clasp doesn't seem quite as secure as other similar belts I have purchased, but I figured it would be okay. I took it off after about 30 seconds (maybe a minute tops), and the elastic on one edge was loose, leaving the edge of the elastic part of the belt looking rippled/puckered. It's still usable, as the puckering doesn't show when it's all stretched out, but I don't expect it to last long. I may have just gotten a defective one where the elastic wasn't fully sewn in to the belt, so if you buy it, I hope you have better luck than me. For the price, I guess I would be happy with a few months worth of use, but this one definitely won't be around long enough to be a closet staple."
3.0,"This is an OK headband.  It says reversible, there is a redish/burnt orange color on the underside.  I am not a fan of this color, so I am not too impressed.  I was hoping that when you have it on the black side, that the red wouldn't show, but it does show a little.  I can see myself wearing this to keep hair out of my face as I am washing my face or putting on a face mask, but I don't think I would wear it out of the house.  The knit fabric is nice and soft."
3.0,I am 5/5 size 18/20 and the Blue Long Sleeve Strips Maxi dress 18plus( the 2XL) made me feel like I was swimming in the dress. Size down.
3.0,Goggles are comfortable but a little large for my face.  (NOTE:  Not comfortable for my husband as his nose is a bit larger than mine.)  At first the goggles sealed well but after a month's use I need to work a little at getting a good seal.  I don't like the attached earplugs.  They don't stay in very well and I tend to hit the strings attaching them when swimming.<br /><br />The swim cap is too large for my head which measures 21.5&#34; in circumference.<br /><br />I haven't used the separate earplugs for nose plug yet.
3.0,"Shoulder straps are a bit on the short side, while the band is a little loose.  Cups are very padded."
3.0,"The outfit was rather big?.. I read the reviews and saw everyone saying it came smaller than expected so I got a bigger size then I‚Äôd normally get and well.... it‚Äôs too big. But that‚Äôs my fault, so make sure you take measurements and don‚Äôt always listen to reviews that are inaccurate. Also, the material feels rather cheap, and the tie is full of lose threads. Everything else is alright I guess.. I‚Äôll be ordering a better one from somewhere else that‚Äôs for sure. But maybe it‚Äôll come in handy some day."
3.0,It was a little to big but over all I like it
3.0,It's metal mesh. It's black. It worked nicely for a week or two. Then the springs kept popping out.
3.0,"Got these in black, very pretty, used it a lot however I've had shoes with more use than these and I still wear for a couple of years, I had to throw these out about 8 months into them, they started to fall apart and I only used them for work (at an office sitting all day)...but for the price it's expected. They did run big for me, I'm a true 7. Also bought another pair in different color, those are in very good condition still but I rarely wear them, also run big"
3.0,We have 2 of these guys.  One one the zipper broke within a few weeks of owning it.
3.0,I wore this dress once. The material doesn‚Äôt stretch and I constantly felt like I was going to rip the crochet every time I sat down.
3.0,I wish for a men's watch the band was a little bigger but it is very nice so far.
3.0,"I buy lots of 82 Days skirts and use them as dresses (I am short). I was hoping I could do that with this skirt as well. Sadly, the fit and material were lacking and it was shorter than anticipated. Would make a cute skirt on a not curvy girl. Not for me."
3.0,"The shirt was very thin material, the shorts as well. Got for my granddaughter fit was perfect."
3.0,My son is 12 months old and the socks were very undersized for him.  Great product but the sizing chart may need some work.
3.0,"Can't keep as many cards as I'd like, and the cards are difficult to get out."
3.0,Ok if you are looking for a super thin long zip up sweatshirt. If you are looking for a comfy-go to favorite‚Ä¶ this probably isn‚Äôt it. Also was very long on me. I am 5‚Äù4 and lime my sweatshirts a little bigger because they generally shrink up. This was a large and it was huge!
3.0,"The product was beautiful, but the small butterfly fell off and was lost within 4 months. For $100 this product should be made with better quality manufacturing by closing or soldering the rings that holds the small butterfly<br />I have now read in other reviews that I am not the only person This has happened to"
3.0,Too small should be for kids not women
3.0,"This was my first pair and loved the design and color, however they are not good quality. Paint on the frame starts to peel off after a few months.."
3.0,I thought these earrings were going to be a bit bigger for the asking price.. but they are not.. they are very small but they are very nice. I bought them for a friend I know she will luv them..
3.0,"I ordered the bkack/white striped in XXL and it fit perfectly; not too long, not too clingy. I ordered the ivory in the same size and the fabric is different. It's a thinner fabric and falls differently, so it clings more. It's also a lot longer, which is a shame. I really love the striped one. (I am 5 feet 3.5 inches tall and wear a 16-18 in most brands.)"
3.0,I am 4.2 and 217 lbs. Dress is a bit above knee. Perfect for someone that has big boobs and cleavage showing. Perfect for breast feeding mums like me (enough room to breastfeed without touching the zip.
3.0,Not so sturdy.
3.0,Love the tip part and the different falgs but the nylon shafts are crap. Broke 3 the first night.
3.0,Fabric was thin. Was expecting more quality.
3.0,"I like the style and design, however the length of the sleeves were a little too long for me"
3.0,Very clingy/static.  Fits true to size though!  Shows every line underneath
3.0,"Too long, thin, too form fitting."
3.0,"It‚Äôs a nice fit, but the material is very cheap and very thin. I regret buying white and wish I at least went with black. I will most likely ship this back."
3.0,Sizes are no where near what is advertised.  They run very small
3.0,This is a good bag for the amount i paid. I do not like the center storage zipper. Its very flimsy. The pockets on the front and back ripped the first week i had it. an easy fix but shouldnt have needed to do that so soon. Overall an ok purse if you need a big bag.
3.0,Awesome design but the clip bites down on your ear leaving red mark.
3.0,Great shades. Was some scratches on the frames.
3.0,Shirt was stuck together like skull was freshly printed- too little back - but I reckon it's cool for what it is.
3.0,"Leggings fit pretty well and feels good. It's a bit short from the behind, meaning I will have to wear a long shirt to cover from behind. (falls short when sitting down)."
3.0,"See through and returned!  Seller refunded money, so I was a happy customer!"
3.0,( beautiful kids watches.)
3.0,So short. A little small. Of course this means my teens love them. I'm not as thrilled.
3.0,the black chocker is garbage i like the arrowhead i would not recomend it unless it had a chain necklace
3.0,"Cute but not really a good material for tying around your waste. There is no stretch to it, so it doesn‚Äôt lay right. I haven‚Äôt actually used it because of that, I imagine it constantly needing to be retired and being more of a hassle than anything"
3.0,Not a good size for men.
3.0,very cheaply made-holes formed less than 2 months.
3.0,Bag was perfect but shipping took forever
3.0,To tight at the top and both girls are skinny and under 100lbs
3.0,"It was just ok for me. I have a another similar dress that I love, but the picture shows no elastic at the neck for the one I ordered, and it came with elastic, which maw it strange, for some reason. I returned. I ordered the medium, in 5'2, 128 lbs"
3.0,"I really can‚Äôt review how they hold up as a sock, as we purchased them to make sock puppets."
3.0,"Okay for the price, does not like the material and the pockets are a bit high in proportion."
3.0,This mask is very thin and cracked easily. I would not recommend or buy it again.
3.0,The back tarnished faster than I would liked.
3.0,"Very narrow, made for kid-sized head/face.  Otherwise, seems quality, but I had to give it to my 12 year old daughter."
3.0,Fits kinda tight
3.0,"Beautiful pendant necklace, however IT IS PINK. I bought it to go with a faux ruby ring. No match."
3.0,"Overall, I like the purse. It is perfectly sized for my needs & is comfortable. Adjustable shoulder strap so it can be worn crossbody or over shoulder. Has 2 large compartments & 4 small pockets. The colors are not as vibrant in person as they are in pictures (even the black parts are a bit faded looking) & the material is a lint magnet, especially for pet hair."
3.0,Good quality but not as I expected
3.0,soles hurt
3.0,The support of the elastic band under the bust is not supportive enough.
3.0,I like the rips but too tight on the butt area
3.0,No where close to how well made it looks. One for the hat rack.( AKA trash) do yourself a favor and keep searching
3.0,The earrings as pictured are somewhat misleading - they have a black back. I would've preferred them to be patterned all the way through.
3.0,"The bag was smaller that expected. It is large enough to put 2 regular size shampoo bottles in its main center pocket but anything bigger that your average and you wont be able to close the bag. The side pockets dont have too much room to store things. You can fit a toothbrush, some nail clippers, or a razor or two but nothing big or bulky like a bar of soap or luffa. The hook on the bag so you can hang it is plastic, i wish it were metal but it will sufice for most. But if you are packing heavy items or a lot of items then it may bend on you. The material is of good quality. The zippers on the side are a little rough but work and none have broke on me. It keeps my things organized and all together.  Not the best but it gets the job done"
3.0,I am 118 pounds and I bought the small size in black. This pants is super cute but runs a size big and they don‚Äôt have a ca size.<br />The fabric is soft and stretchy but not a tight stretchy  so I would say get a size smaller if u want it To fit tight. I am so bumped that I have to return it bcz it‚Äôs big for me but if you are not petite and tiny you should get it
3.0,"I had to get married more quickly than I had expected in August and needed to find something fast with a tight budget. I am a 36B 150lbs and 5' 2''. I ordered a size 10 and it fit absolutely beautifully. I am about a size 9 in jeans because I have a bigger butt but my chest is somewhat average size and I didn't even need to wear a bra, it held the girls in and up so comfortably and felt confident. It felt like the dress was made for me that's how amazing it felt. Since I got married in the middle of August it was excruciatingly hot out so it was perfect because it felt light on my skin. Not too long either. The only complaint I have is that it is very, very see through. So if you order this dress I highly recommend ordering a dress slip which should do the trick."
3.0,i was expecting the buckle clip for the shawl that was described in the description.
3.0,It is fit smaller so order a size larger than you are it tears up easy
3.0,Quality is just ok. Get what you pay for.
3.0,Great sunglasses made Witt quality sturdy materials. I returned them unfortunately due to the way they fit my face.
3.0,When I first received the item it smelled horribly. I had to wash it which was frustrating because I wanted to start wearing it as soon as I got it
3.0,They are nice sweaters but size is much smaller than expected.
3.0,I like them but was somewhat disappointed also. Last year I purchased some Cuddle Dud supersoft socks in dark colors. I just LOVE them. I guess I thought these would be the same. These are very thin. I‚Äôll wear them but if you ever offer the supersoft ones in white I would love to know.
3.0,"This is a great clear stadium bag, but the zipper is low quality.  I‚Äôve bought 2 bags and zipper hasn‚Äôt held up.  They have been great with returning!  I‚Äôm gonna try one more time because they say the 3rd is a charm."
3.0,"This dress is really beautiful and the material is very nice and soft, unfortunately it‚Äôs too small for me. I‚Äôm trying to get a different size since I really like it."
3.0,"Purchased for a baby shower dress. I am 26 weeks pregnant with triple Ds. My chest took up all of the top and the straps were not as long as you would think and pulled the dress tighter in the chest, so I would recommend sizing up with hopes the straps would be looser."
3.0,They fit great until I washed them (followed the instructions on the label). Now my fianc√© has two pairs of pants he can't wear unless he drops a size or two...disappointed üòï
3.0,This came a bit smaller than expected.  I ordered a size larger than what I thought I needed so it's just about right.  It did shrink up a little.
3.0,Cute cover up but slightly small. Not exactly what I was looking for.
3.0,Ease of use. Too big in top
3.0,"The charm that reads &#34;Police Officers Wife&#34; the ink is VERY light, it needs to be darker so you can read what it says. The bracelet itself is nice."
3.0,"Being a British ex-pat growing up in England during the 80s my mother always put me in waterproof playsuits as a kid and fast forward to 2021 and finding out that adult versions are now available, I was excited to relieve those old days.<br /><br />The suit itself is very well constructed, with a side pocket with taped seams that will keep you dry.  Although, if you wear for an extended period of time you will start to sweat as the suit isn't breathable, the only problem is that American sizing on average is at around one size larger in general so people in the US who wear an XL will find the all in one potentially tight and unfortunately dry kids does not offer the 2X version on Amazon which would be ideal for US XL wearers.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend sizing up either one or preferably two sizes up."
3.0,The Fox was fine but the Wolf broke while my son was putting it on for the first time.
3.0,"Much bigger than expected. One also came crooked. You can't easily bend them, either."
3.0,"I loved loved loved this bracelet when I got it, however I've been wearing it everyday for about a week and today it broke.  I was not treating it with any undue stress, the cord at the top of the anchor had loosened and in my gentle effort to pull them slightly tighter the anchor stem snapped, I understand that this product is not expensive or high quality but I sure expected the charm to outlast the cord not the other way around...very disappointed that I was only able to wear this for a week!! After paying nearly the same for shipping as the item cost I will not be ordering another."
3.0,I ordered a six and they were the same size as my sons size 5.
3.0,I ordered 18w per the size chart. It was huge on me. Returned.
3.0,This is a very nice dress and it fit good below the waist but the upper back was huge and sadly I had to return it.
3.0,Very nice one piece but the size is it and fit my daughter well.  She's 10 and usually wears a size 7-8 but this one ran a little small.
3.0,This is a really cute dress and it does favor the photo but it was too small in the chest and way too short in the front. Does not fit like it does on the model. I even sized up so I would have that looser fit bit sadly it just didn‚Äôt work for me. Very cute though just too short and small.
3.0,Has a good color and the material feels very smooth and comfortable. It does get a little sloppy at the connection points. They snap on securely but the silicone nearest the to the watch is not very precisely cut. The silicone is cut larger than the watch's mold so it doesn't match up right. Ends up looking  cheap compared to the OEM bands. You get what you pay for here.
3.0,"This blouse just had a funny fit on me, not really too big or small but just not flattering. It just did not look good. It was comfortable, and it seemed well made, but the cut was not flattering. I just could not see wearing it. It is too bad becuase I liked the pictures. Perhaps someone with a different body shape would find it more flattering for them. There wasn't anything wrong with it, and the quality was okay, but it didn't work for me. It was soft."
3.0,"There are a few things that are weird:<br /><br />1 The link does not even show my item anymore it‚Äôs something completely different.<br /><br />2 The fabric is a weird polysesterish, almost like a work shirt or something.<br /><br />3. Had to order up<br /><br />4. The belt does not fall even remotely close to my natural waist, think more empire.<br /><br />5. My reviews keep disappearing.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br /><br />1 It has pockets<br /><br />2. It is the color I ordered my camera washed it out."
3.0,"Pros: the AWESOME design<br /><br />Cons: the cheapest, 80 grit shirt on the market. It‚Äôs rougher than Ric Flairs chops. This thing is made of Arn and Oles beard trimmings stitched with Tully‚Äôs chest hairs. J J Dillon kicked this shirt out of the stable and had no choice but to return it."
3.0,"I have a black version of this and really like it, but this one feels larger and less flattering. Not sure if it was just the color on me or what, but I felt like a box when I put it on. Returned with no probs!"
3.0,This ring is absolutely gorgeous!<br /><br />Update. After less than a week a stone has already fallen out :(
3.0,I bought this partly because mask use is everywhere and partly because I‚Äôm exAir Force (CA Air National Guard). I only gave it three stars because some of the printing was blurred or out of register.
3.0,I didnt like the brim of the hat. It is not a regular brim like a baseball cap. The design of the logo was spot on though.
3.0,The watch came already running so short battery life
3.0,"These are as labeled-thick material! Wish it were a bit softer, but they are good quality and the colors are exactly as shown. More of a snug than a loose fit."
3.0,One fit good And the other was too small how crazy is that
3.0,I received the wrong color and did not have enough time before a party to exchange.
3.0,From the first time using them they consistently fog up.  Followed all directions given for use.  This was the main reason I purchased them.
3.0,I am pretty sure this is a &#34;juniors&#34; fit. I am a size six and it is way too tight across the hips. It is cute and I would consider returning for a larger size but I'm concerned it will still be too tight on the hips. If you are slender build than the size might be okay but if you have hips keep looking.
3.0,"Overall I am pleased with this boot. It is still early, so it is yet to be determined if they hold up structurally.  (posted in March).  Ok, so it has now been 7 months since buying these boots and as I was worried that although the boot looks nice I was a little concerned about durability. After 7 months the upper portion of the boot cracked where the upper meets the reinforcement portion of the boot. I would not recommend this boot if your looking for durability."
3.0,the cap was more like a slouch type with excess material in the back.  It was a gift and I was disappointed when the recipient tried it on. I was going for a more fitted look.
3.0,"Look very nice, but not well made. One of the beads fell off after wearing them after just once."
3.0,"Opening the package, I LOVED the color and material. However once I got it on I didn‚Äôt love it as much. Maybe 1 or 2 sizes up would have been better but it doesn‚Äôt fit like the pictures shows. The bottom of it just hits a little weird and hugs a little weird and just isn‚Äôt very flattering. So I would just suggest sizing up"
3.0,Not comfortable snaps are hard to fasten quality is not what I expected for the.price. The snaps are rough on the surgical ports.
3.0,Close fit... The legs are too wide.
3.0,Cool but cheap wood
3.0,"This long sleeve hooded shirt is a bit bulky, but comfortable overall. The appearance makes it seem warmer than it actually is. It's actually quite thin. The hood is a bonus. And, it has a corduroy texture. While I don't think that I would purchase this or anything like it in the future, it was a fine purchase for the price."
3.0,I don't feel like this hides/flattens anything. It doesn't stay in place. I wore it for several hours yesterday and it kept rolling up all night.
3.0,"Bottoms were big - top fit weird. Cute if you have a normally proportioned body. For reference I am 5'6&#34;, 35-26-35 and usually wear a small US4. Returning."
3.0,The color is a lot more orangey than I expected.
3.0,Will see if I can stretch them
3.0,The material is extremely thin.  Not sure it would hold up to being laundered.
3.0,They seem to work but bend and flex evey time we use it. If feels like it will bresk
3.0,I returned them.  They weren't very flattering and were too thin.
3.0,"Price was low, but materials not the greatest."
3.0,"I got this for a Christmas gift this year because we did a $10 limit party theme. The description said it was originally $50, but was marked down to like $4 something when I bought it. I FINALLY got it... 2 weeks after Christmas.. and can honestly say I'm glad I didn't pay any more that $4 for it. It definitely is not $50 quality, that if for sure. It arrived with a couple of the tiny gems had fallen off. Totally sucks..."
3.0,I bought this while in the hospital during a long recovery.  It was large on me and slid around my arm easily.  It also got caught in long sleeves.  Otherwise it served its purpose and for the price it was a good buy.
3.0,Just too large
3.0,"I really wanted this dress to work for me but the size I ordered (my normal dress size) was a good 2-3 sizes too small somehow!  I guess if you have a chest of any sort, size up.  That or I got a fluke.  The dress is unique so I may try ordering up 2-3 sizes if it's available via Prime."
3.0,Fits WAY smaller than said size. Go up a size if you purchase this shirt.
3.0,"This bag is where it‚Äôs at. Typical of similar bags there are more slots, zippers and pouches than any man would ever know what to do with (that‚Äôs a plus in my book). I feel like I can fit ANYTHING in this bag and still zip it up. Great product.<br /><br />EDIT**** After a year and a half the color has washed off the backpack leaving it pink and pale green. Definitely not quality material."
3.0,"These earring's are very pretty and they look very sophisticated, I only gave it 3 star's because one of the earring's prong's was bent quite a bit, I'm glad I was able to fix it."
3.0,I chose 3 stars only due to the size of the chain. Its pretty big. Over all its good. Pretty simple looking.
3.0,Buttons fell off shortly after putting the shirt on. I had to see them back on. I like the shirt though.
3.0,Was expecting a little more of a classy look..much shorter not Floor lenght as it appears..I am 5'7 ..dress fits my body  but has no tag to indicate actual size. I ordered 2x
3.0,Nice hat. Good sun protection. Just a bit snug.
3.0,These are plastic so just know they do not fully tighten but they also don't fall off either
3.0,This is a good solid belt when you're wearing jeans.  I cannot see myself wearing this with anything business. The weaving doesn't look like actual weaving but the belt feels very solid and I can tell it will take a long time for this to wear down.  Solid belt.
3.0,This swimsuit was a very well put together and have good quality material the only problem was it was way too small so I had to return it it is not true to size I wish it would have been.
3.0,"This dress is so cute but it was very ""gappy"" in the underarm area.  Had to return"
3.0,"This hat is sized as a Small/Medium. It's not. It's more a Medium/Large. I wear a 7 - 7 1/8 hat, which is generally considered ""medium,"" and this hat is loose/big on me.<br /><br />Overall, it looks fine, just like i expected it to. It's not too flat, shape is fine, material (wool/viscose blend) is decent, etc.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned: the inner band/support at the bill is truly awkward. Most hats have a flat, 1/2"" or so PADDED band that should comfortably sit against one's forehead. This one doesn't. It's like a thick piece of folded cardboard about 1/8"" thick covered in thin cotton that sits directly against one's forehead. If this hat were snug fitting, i could see how the ""dent"" would form. Luckily, it is loose on me, so there's no dent, but it's still rather uncomfortable.<br /><br />I guess it's a decent hat for the price, i *do* wear it for short periods when my wardrobe doesn't match my brown herringbone, the sizing is certainly off, and it's definitely not all that comfortable."
3.0,"I'm going to be honest here. Its not as vibrant nor does it look as good as the picture, more faded looking in person. It's not thick at all, more like a thin semi oversized hoodie. Overall it's just ok, will keep."
3.0,"Ummmm looks great and fits okay,  but a strap broke like immediately out the box."
3.0,"Not very stable, easy to assemble"
3.0,"Its a good band, and I like the lavender/grey color, however like the many other reviews, the small piece of metal causes a rash on the skin inside my wrist.  I've never experience that before.  Not worth the time/effort to send the band back.  I place a small piece of medical tape or band-aid over the metal part so it doesn't touch my skin, and that has resolved the problem."
3.0,"I love this cardigan, so cute and soft, size is great, too. I did think that it was longer than it is in reality. The front comes down much longer than the back, it hits right at the top of my butt which isn't terrible or necessarily unflattering, but not what I expected."
3.0,"It works fine to keep sun off your neck and the sides of your face . . . but it's very blousy, very long and a bit silly looking. I couldn't go out in this thing so I sent it back. It needed to be at least four inches shorter, perhaps more, or it's like wearing a towel on your head and shoulders. I thought about having it shortened, etc., but I don't have time for that. There's room for improvement here."
3.0,I liked that I could use it to call or answer calls from but did not like how hard it was to take the phone out of it nor how small the billfold part of it was.
3.0,The fit was okay I think because I have fat on my back I need a vest type corset
3.0,Feels great material wise just  should have gotten a size bigger
3.0,Had to stretch width. Runs very narrow
3.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and thickness of the material. THe stitching seemed solid. Now for the bad news: this is NOT constructed for anyone with boobs bigger than a C/D cup (in my opinion). It gapped weirdly in the armhole, showing my bra very clearly and creating weird puckers in the chest area. This is not strictly a sizing issue as I ordered the exact size that should have fit based on my measurements. It's just not constructed for someone who has an 8"" difference between under- and over-bust. It's a really nice quality top though, so if you're smaller-busted, go for it!"
3.0,Nice earring very sparkly the only reason I gave I three stars the back piece was dis colored and old like they had it along time was disappointed they would send it to me like that otherwise it's ok
3.0,Nice and warm or thick but nothing like as pictured.  These are beige but look ivory. Not as tall or slouchy as shown. I am petite 112 lbs 5.4. Pic to give an idea of size.
3.0,In the picture is shows the bag with bows mine was missing one.
3.0,"Cute suit, just an awkward fit. My torso is a little longer than what the suit was"
3.0,Beautiful but was returned due to size.
3.0,"Cute top, shorts were horrible and cheaply made. But, worth the purchase for the top!!"
3.0,The neck chain hurts so badly and I ordered in two colors. Can barely wear it longer than an hour. Cute otherwise and bottoms are even better!
3.0,Classic fit is so wide. I had to pay to fix it.
3.0,"Very comfortable bra, but the only problem is the straps are long (not adjustable) and do not offer much support."
3.0,"Not bad for the price. They feel very similar to Lululemon‚Äôs wonder under capris. They do show heavy sweating in the crotch/bum region. Despite that, I have bought 2 pairs and will buy more colors in the future."
3.0,"I was surprised how small it was in the package.  Made me super nervous as I was stretching it to fit my wrist but is very comfortable to wear.  The heart charm as you can see in the picture, is super small, which makes it very difficult to read what it says."
3.0,"I only had it in for 1 month and it's already rusting, I really liked it too üòî"
3.0,The design is good but quality is in question. ( my wife was just ready to use this gift of mine and then the handle having a visible crack  )
3.0,Too tiny and delicate for me
3.0,"This dress was pretty big- the belt helps, but not enough. Additionally, the fabric is extremely thin and the pockets add a ton of volume at the hips, which was not my goal. Returned."
3.0,The butt and waist is a bit tight. Swimsuit is cheap quality.
3.0,"These match the pendant necklace I have but the cardinal is kind of an orangy red, not a vibrant red like real bird."
3.0,Return the boot
3.0,"Being a fat person is no picnic and it seems that every underwear add is of blokes with six packs. Do they think that we need to imagine ourselves as lean and fit in order to buy undies? The problem is with the sizing charts, they are inaccurate and there is no pictures of fat people wearing these garments; so there is no way to tell how they would fit. I guess I will have to do as most thin people believe and stop eating every meal at my favorite fast food chain. Then I can loose some weight, get a six pack and fit into my undies."
3.0,"The color is good, but the long is the problem"
3.0,Well the dress is not the exact from the picture but still pretty cute dress.
3.0,To small and I'm mesure my wrist  first<br />But it look nice  to bad is to small
3.0,"Nice shirt, but this particular XL fits almost like an XXL."
3.0,"I am not sure if this will change anything for me health wise but I liked the way it looked online. In person, the silicone collects a lot of dust and is a dull black. I wish this was a smoother silicone with a blacker color to it like what is shown in ProExl's product photos.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I'd like the shiny part but I actually really like the way it looks. It's so shiny that i think it makes the band look extra dull though! It is very comfortable to wear. I have a small wrist and the first day had it on the last hole, but overnight moved it to the second to last hole and it's been comfortable ever since. For me, it's a little expensive.<br /><br />In my picture, the white stuff on the band is all the stuff that gets stuck to it. But i think there is a clear difference between the black of the shiny part and the dull black of the band which I'm not a fan of."
3.0,Wish it had some kind of sleeves
3.0,This shirt was not true to size and smaller than expected. I would have liked it otherwise. I returned this item.
3.0,Excellent value for the price. Runs a little small.
3.0,"The quality is pretty decent. It has thick materials and a good amount of fluff on the insides. The flex is decent, so it will do well for new walkers.  The problems I had with it tho is that it was way too large ( probably need to have size 5.5 or 6 for 12 months) and (this was more so the issue) the Velcro for the leg part was not adjustable. My kiddo likes to take his shoes off so I need something that has a thicker Velcro strips so I can adjust it to fit his legs, which this product doesn't have."
3.0,"They are okay, they are a little tight on my head but something is weird with the polarizedness of the glasses. They take away the glare but they distort somethings and it gives me a headache after a while. They are nicely made though."
3.0,Good quality material but does not fit like the model shown. The material is thick and has some stretch to it so if you want the loose look like on the model i suggest ordering two sizes up. I can get the corner into a knot with the size i ordered but it is definitely not the same look. Without the knot the shirt is just a casual T-shirt that I would wear running errands maybe.
3.0,Cute sweater! I didn't keep it though because it's much thinner than I expected.
3.0,shortier than they appeared on picture.
3.0,"I was disappointed to find that there was only one sleeve. I was able to cut the other side open and still wear it over my bathing suit at the beach this year. I liked the color and it still served it's purpose, so I guess that's all that counts."
3.0,I believe this hat was made for teens. Its well made but is too small for my head. Gave it to my daughter and she loves it!
3.0,Color was off.  In the images legging looked navy with green clovers.  When I received them it was closer to black background with teal/blueish clovers.
3.0,unstable battery i have to shake my hand every 10 min to wake up the watch!!!!!
3.0,Love the hat but it is entirely too large for a toddler. I ended up wearing this hat myself.
3.0,This bra is a bit small around but with the extender that it comes with it fits better.
3.0,"The product is sturdy, but the fabric is a little too heavy for my taste"
3.0,"The color and pattern are pretty, but the way it laid on me looked like a Mumu. I am busty, so it could just be the way it laid on me... but my kid said I looked like a grandma, so back it went."
3.0,Fits a bit large on a women's wrist
3.0,"Love the length, but the bra is too small..."
3.0,smaller than expected... not a full as the photo but the lights worked and it served its purpose.  There is also only one row of lights.  In picture looks like there's multiple strands.
3.0,"I loved it...but when I touched my ear the other day, it fell out and, tiny as it was, was unfindable."
3.0,"Kinda stiff roller, but this was among the cheaper rollers. Rolled okay cigarettes and decent joints."
3.0,Broke the first day I wore it and the engraving looks painted on and not engraved like in the picture
3.0,Way too short for me so my oldest daughter took it wears it
3.0,"They are definitely soft and comfortable. However, the buttons come undone way to easy. If I turn when I'm in bed, it just opens up..I'm not happy with that."
3.0,"Like this a lot, except for the fact that it started coming apart at the seams, before even being worn. Thankfully, I can sew. Now, the second shirt of same style has come apart at shoulder, even though it has only been worn for about 2 hours."
3.0,Very thick and not very attractive. Bottom grippers not the best.
3.0,I was looking for something to lounge around in. This did not do it for me. Looks awkward on me. It is soft though. Returned
3.0,"Runs quite large. So comfortable, but not so flattering."
3.0,This doesn‚Äôt really fit like it looks in the picture. The band at the top of very wide and does not sit as low as shown. Not very flattering. I am returning
3.0,"The silicone is good quality, the clip stays on well, and the clock works fine. However, the glow feature only works after it is in the light and glows for only about a minute immediately after being in direct light. The amount of time in the light does not seem to affect the amount of time it glows. It works for what I intended it for doing clinicals in the hospital, and the rooms are usually not pitch black during day shift. So, I could still see the numbers and hands on the clock in the dark-ish room."
3.0,"The dress is pretty and fit perfectly. However, the dress I purchased is the purple dress and the picture shows that the lace is a dark purple when in fact it is much lighter. What disappointed me the most was the packaging. I did not recieve a reciept of my order and the bag the dress came in smelled of cigarettes causing my dress to smell too. That is NOT okay!"
3.0,They're ok. Super shiny faux leather. I guess I was hoping for more of a matte look. They look cheap to me but seem decent enough quality for the price.
3.0,AF doesn't work at all but decent adapter sturdy and the tripod mount built in is nice
3.0,The arms on this are small.
3.0,"I wouldn't recommend it for long term, the other things are fine, but the backpack easily rips at the top."
3.0,Covid-19
3.0,"The earrings are cute but I felt that the picture online was misleading.  Looking at the pitcture, I was expecting the top portion of the earring is at least the same width as the pearl, but the top portion is actually much smaller.  I like the bottom portion of the earring where the pearl dangles."
3.0,The chain broke
3.0,"Super comfy cardigan,  but hits way shorter than I usually like."
3.0,"I love the size and style of this blouse. The color is practical, and the design looks nice on just about any average to large-sized woman. The garment is comfortable and flattering. The only downside is the fabric. I usually never order anything in polyester, but I was so enamored of the design, that I took a chance. Besides, polyesters differ, and one doesn't always feel like the next. Unfortunately, this blouse comes in a polyester that takes away from the fashionability of the garment. The material feels cheap, amd, when wearing it, can make one feel hot and sweaty. I give high marks for design and low marks for material. If this were 100% cotton or even a basic cotton-polyester blend, this would rate five stars easily."
3.0,"I love the way this jacket looks, but really wish the material wasn‚Äôt so thin. It‚Äôs way thinner than your typical t shirt and there were so many loose strings on it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to last very long because of this."
3.0,"Nice looking, but very thin. Will not keep you warm. When I think hoodie, I think warmth. Not happening with this hoodie. It‚Äôs more just for looks. I wanted to send it back, but of course my child liked the way it looks, so we had to keep it."
3.0,"I love the colors flowers shape and beads, but for me is kind of tight for my head. I wear it as a necklace and in my hair for short time ."
3.0,"I was hoping for better quality, but it should hold up well enough with infrequent use.  Sassy watch that gets compliments."
3.0,This is a little on the bigger side if you have a smaller-average face and the legs are so thin that in my opinion it felt more worrisome than fashionable but it's all my perspective!
3.0,"Very cute design just as pictured. The material is soft and comfy. However, the sizing is quite off, runs very small. NOT a pliable option for me plus size sistas, unless you don‚Äôt mind skin tight."
3.0,"Nice earrings but very small,was hoping for much larger ones,and difficult to put in,because they were so small."
3.0,"material is less than desirable, easy to put holes through."
3.0,Constantly pulling them up at work..
3.0,"Similar to the picture but not what I was expecting. Not very flattering at all and ran a little small. Comfy material. Shrank some during washing. Would work as a bathing suit cover-up, not necessarily &#34;going out&#34; material."
3.0,"Fast shipping and fits the requirements for my daughters catholic school dress code . She also is very fussy on the comfort of shoes and has no complaints with these . Some of the not so good is the flower decoration on the Velcro strap fell of on day 2. I was able to super glue it back on but I do not expect this will last long. The flower doesn‚Äôt affect the function of the shoe or strap but was upsetting to my child as it is her ‚Äúfavorite part‚Äù. These shoes also scuff very easily, I have no doubt my kindergarten child is tough on them but they had noticeable scuff marks after the first week. Because of this I‚Äôll likely have to replace in a month or so. The price was very reasonable so even with the negatives I would still buy again."
3.0,has a big orange panel.  we thought it was smaller and pink.
3.0,Shirt runs very small. I otherwise like it and the quality is good. Definitely wished I had ordered about two sizes bigger.
3.0,I thought these don't tarnish? Bought in January of last year and all 3 sets sure are. They lasted a little over a year only.
3.0,Fits more like large
3.0,Beautiful but just ‚Äògreen‚Äô<br />Not jade...a very dark green...
3.0,"The product quality seems good (sturdy) esp. for the price, but the color wasn't what I expected. All of the hues are brighter in person and have a glittery metallic quality that I didn't notice in the photos. The glitteriness makes it look cheaper to me, more like costumewear."
3.0,short!
3.0,"I ordered these for a wedding. The reviews weren't the best,  but they had the exact look I wanted so I took a chance. The anklets are beautiful! Three of the four were perfect, but the fourth broke before the wedding. The other three held up perfectly! In hindsight I should have ordered a couple of extras as the price was great.  I would recommend these for the look alone, just be prepared for them to possibly break and order an extra or two."
3.0,"I ordered a 7/8 (pictured on the left) of the white sweatshirt with the flames.  It's very small.  I double checked the tag that I was given the size I ordered.  I rushed to order the next size up as this was supposed to be a gift.  The 8/10 is pictured on the right.  Really disappointed. Quality seems good though, but I haven't washed it."
3.0,Loved the fabric and color but cut of x-large was a fit of a large. Had to return.
3.0,"I do like this shirt. It's soft and comfortable. I expected it to be oversized, but the sleeves were not tight around the arms as portrayed in the pictures. I'm hoping they'll shrink a bit in the wash, but I wish I would've ordered a size down."
3.0,"This is OK,,,"
3.0,"Big & bulky, didn't look as nice in person as the photos."
3.0,"The dress is very pretty, but it's way to small! It's very short and tight fitting.  I wanted to use this dress for my bridal shower, but ended up returning it."
3.0,Don‚Äôt want dirt in your hole
3.0,It's a nice piece but after a few days wearing it the black paint started to come off not a problem since it's just the back of the pendant but overall not back for the price.
3.0,"This money clip wallet would get 5 stars if it were just a fraction of an inch wider. As it is it's very hard to get cards out... have been working to stretch it a bit but it's leather so I think it will take a while... for reference, I carry about 6 credit card size items which includes my license. This is definitely the thinnest wallet I could find so I will stick with it!"
3.0,Catching dust and lint to band from shirts. Material seems to wear quicker.
3.0,"I got the ""set 1"" without wig or necklace (I am wearing the necklace because I bought it elsewhere) and the outfit was just ok. I normally wear a size L but I first ordered the XL then 2XL. Tbh the XL fit fine in all places except the thigh area. when I wore the pants in the correct placement it was tight like leggings halfway down my thigh. 2XL didn't make a difference in the same thigh area, in fact it actually seemed like smaller pants and a bigger top. I'll be keeping it though to wear to an anime convention because it works ok if I wear the pants like low-rise pants but then I have to keep the shirt un-tucked instead of tucked in like Inuyasha which isn't the worst thing in the world so I'll make the compromise. I just hate that I paid ~$40 to have to compromise LOL.<br /><br />I forgot to thread the black by the hem near the wrists, but I saw that it came with the ribbon so I assume it is thread-able. Will try to remember to come back to this review to confirm later.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the material, I don't know what ""uniform cloth"" is, but its definitely not cotton comfortable, but it is also not so uncomfortable that I wouldn't wear it.<br /><br />If you don't have thunder thighs and don't mind the meh material, all and all I'd actually probably recommend it even as critical as my review may be lol."
3.0,Muy bueno pero no trajo una parte el√°stica de la bota que es importante
3.0,"It's a little larger than I thought, but that hasn't really presented a problem. Still, it's pretty comfortable, and has been pretty durable so far."
3.0,Not for wide/normal feet.  They were super narrow.  They seemed like nice shoes otherwise.  Had to return.
3.0,"Super cute but waaaaaay to small. Definitely order 1-2 sizes up. I ordered a medium, I always wear a medium, and it was too small. But they didn‚Äôt offer anything bigger than a medium. Meh."
3.0,"A great shirt that, while it does run tight, is very soft with a well printed Graphic."
3.0,Upper fit best bottoms was extremely loose
3.0,"I was so excited to receive these, the look great and the price was good... but the clip on them is easily broken, the black one broke so I never got a chance to wear it.  I've been wearing the white and silver which are very stylish... 1 out of 3 is good I guess."
3.0,"It must have been stored in a place riddled with mold or mildew.  In the two weeks that I‚Äôve had it, I‚Äôve sprayed it three times with Febreeze. The stink is getting better but I still can‚Äôt store it in my closet. The belt itself fits true to size and accents my dress very well."
3.0,"The material of this sweater was perfect! The weight and length of both the sweater itself and the arms was wonderful and the color was gorgeous. The addition of pockets was awesome. I researched cardigan sweaters up to $100 for days leading up to the purchase of this one. While there are a lot of plusses, the frustrating part is the utter lack of material in the body. This sweater will not close around my body. It barely comes to the center of each breast. This is insane for a cardigan. Boo."
3.0,These are nice and well made. I am 5'11&#34; and they didn't come to my knee like I hoped they would. They stopped about 3-4 inches below the knee which was very uncomfortable.
3.0,I bought this in two colors.  The grey one fits great and I get lots of compliments.  The blue one I purchased is a longer in the back and feels like I am wearing a moomoo.
3.0,"Looove the colors and how soft this watch band is! However, it stretches and it Seems to stay stretched no matter how tight you make the band. It‚Äôs cute but not ideal for long term use"
3.0,"I found these to be too small to ""fit over"" glasses. Perhaps a child would be able to use them. They are very small.  The quality is good. I'm giving it 3 stars due to the size."
3.0,This item was too small even after following measurement guide.
3.0,At least they were cheap.  They're not really rings to be worn. Seem more like a craft item. Uncomfortable.
3.0,The fabric feels thick and heavier than a nice cotton y shirt. V neck is small and high up. It‚Äôs alright but not my favorite
3.0,These are for children but not made to last very long. Started falling apart after first wearing
3.0,Dislike the fit way too long
3.0,I was expecting it to be longer but it will do.
3.0,"I was super excited about purchasing this to complete my Halloween costume. It came quickly and was packaged well but unfortunately didnt fit quit right so I ended up returning it. I wear a small in tops and have a curvy lower half (my glutes, hips and legs are strong and pop lol). Although the material was stretchy and very comfortable it looked funny being so lose then so tight in other areas. I did recommend it to a friend though and she rocked the hell out of it and it looked wonderful."
3.0,The zipper broke as I was getting ready for a Christmas party - only the second time wearing the dress. Very frustrated.
3.0,"I purchased a medium, wish I got a large, but it‚Äôs not impossible to wear.<br />The yellow on the other hand‚Ä¶ you can see EVERYTHING you don‚Äôt even need to squat or bend down it‚Äôs already showing‚Ä¶ these ones def became just an at home workout leggings, haha!"
3.0,I thought they would be more like no show socks. They are more sheer than I was searching for.
3.0,The solid color wasn't flattering. It needed to be a little more fitted in the bust area.
3.0,Doesn't fit like picture exactly otherwise nice.
3.0,"Item arrived on time however, the petals on the bridge of the nose are positioned in a slightly lopsided way. These might be ok for a costume, but they really won't be for daily use as I had intended."
3.0,Nice chain very reasonalble
3.0,If you‚Äôre thicker do not get. I got an XL for my fianc√© and they were way too tight. This is more for thinner woman. Would look nice on though.
3.0,The dress was really baggy on me and it felt really heavy. The material felt soft. Will definetly wear to church or a funeral.
3.0,"I loved it but the zipper arrived broken, & on top of that it was too snug. Wish the XL was available in the green! Will be returning for the red color. Hopefully the zipper doesn‚Äôt arrive broken."
3.0,"I picked this seller because the description said the setting was &#34;natural&#34;. When I received it, I immediately saw it was NOT. The 'setting' is some kind of plastic that has been poured into the setting area and has spilled over onto the silver. The color is seafoam green, not even turquoise green and there are bubbles or specks in the center of the plastic. I only gave it a 3 and keeping it because I like the silver. It was made in Thailand. Also, the band is thinner than pictured. I am using it for a pinkie ring anyway."
3.0,"This product was so close to being perfect and it's a shame because if it did what it was supposed to then I would give it 5 stars. It has a manufacturing flaw of not grasping my ear at all. It's like a &#34;C&#34; shaped open scoop shape that is supposed to hang on to my ears, which it doesn't so these earrings ends up hanging off my ears. &#62;.&#60;"
3.0,"Good for Halloween, but only if you are a child. Looks very fake. The front breast plate looked like a plastic table cloth."
3.0,Somewhat flimsy.
3.0,Way to big... OK quality.
3.0,The pants were way to small. More like a 2T not 4T
3.0,They turn inside out easily.
3.0,These are ok. I dried them on medium and the elastic around the waist bunched :/
3.0,"So I have one ear that is sensitive to metals. As in itching, drainage, etc. In the past have switched earrings from one side to the other to make sure it wasn't just the earring. There are a rare few types of earrings I can wear without having to 'doctor' them up with nail polish or any other tricks. Unfortunately this is not one of them. Within half an hour my ear was itching up a storm.<br /><br />I do like the look of them and at the time of buying, they were on sale for $10, so I'll just end up fixing them up so my sensitive ear can tolerate it.<br /><br />But yeah, those with sensitive ear piercings... Think twice before buying this."
3.0,The fit is just right and I'm a 9.5 US size. Take a little getting used to - in a good way‚ò∫I only wish they were a little thicker.
3.0,Slight small for the size I ordered. The material feels nice but it starts to fall apart quickly.
3.0,"I would return, but it wasn't a prime item.  I might try to doctor it up myself with some jewels or paint, but the sellers pictures don't reflect the poor quality of the print.  I gave stars for the quality of the material of the shirt."
3.0,"Not loving the way these look under clothes. They are comfortable, but I cannot wear with certain shirts and dresses.<br />Fit is accurate."
3.0,This was part of the package i bought with shoe trees. I hope it works as advertised but it's simply too soon to say.
3.0,I liked the product but the only thing I didn't like is that it took almost a month to get it.
3.0,"This is a cute, comfortable dress. The price was right and the color is nice. A bit smaller that I expected but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll wear it often."
3.0,The heart is nice. The chain looks a little cheap. This jewelry is hard to fill
3.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a comfy over-sized sweater, then this one‚Äôs for you! It was almost drowning my medium sized, 5‚Äô3‚Äù daughter. It looked like she was wearing her boyfriend‚Äôs sweater!"
3.0,"The material on these pants are cheap.<br />They are slightly see through.<br />The softness is on the outside only.<br />I ordered a size up, I shouldn‚Äôt have.<br />I think I would have been better off ordering a size down for a tighter fit or my regular size for a looser fit.<br />They are comfortable but they are cheap."
3.0,Color a little too orange for me. I was hoping more camel brown. Besides that cut not too bad and good quality of fabric
3.0,"This is a great back pack for many purposes. It is larger than needed for a general day-pack use, perfect for some basic organization with all of the pockets.  It seems to be made for the larger-sized person (and that's relative, as I'm a smaller gal! The 6' 180# fella size its perfect for).  Took it traveling to NYC, from Colorado, it did very well, save the hanging strap on the back broke upon the first use.  All else has been stout and working great.  Bright color is excellent!"
3.0,"These are inexpensive and easy to use. The latch is a little wonky, and does not cinch as tight as I would like or expect."
3.0,"Love the fit, pretty.  But, the green color is extremely pale. Almost white. Not what I saw in photo."
3.0,The bow tie was too fat. It did not have the normal bow tie clip. Other than that it looked good.
3.0,"I really was excited to get these bands. They were the style I was looking for and the colors were vibrant. However after a few weeks, the color on the band I was wearing started to wear off.  This may be because I'm very active - I work out with weights and do a lot of yard work.  I'm so disappointed! I will be returning this set and looking for another one."
3.0,"I used this watch myself as replacement for daily wear watch. It functions well, is comfortable and serves my purpose."
3.0,The color of the dress is super cute but it is a true bodycon dress. It hugs every part of your body I would suggest getting a size larger than what you really need.
3.0,These masks seem like good quality and comfortable. However they are HUGE. Purchased for my 5 year old and they are huge on him. Pictured is a mask the usual size efor a child (white) next to this mask (patterned).
3.0,They are very comfortable but the sizing is off. It said fit as expected but they fit a size smaller than what I ordered but other than that they are nice to wear .
3.0,Good quality but much smaller than picture.<br />I was disappointed because I ordered this shirt based on the look of the sleeves. I gave it to my sister.
3.0,Functional and thicker material than others. Ordered the size shirt my husband normally wears. Was very roomy and long. Not quite as expected. My husband didn't like this shirt as well as some of the others we tried for his Shoulder surgery recovery.
3.0,"Love Russell.!! But man the size does not make sense!! I always wear XL, but this is more like XXL!! If not more!! Quality is second to non, but cut and size is off!! Must taper around the waist,and too long!!"
3.0,Not a long term solution. Melts in no time and ceases to be useful.
3.0,"I expected them to be adjustable,  sum of them dont fit,  they are a little big"
3.0,Nice watch. Not cheap looking at all. You get what you pay for. Loved it. Lasted about 8 months. Problems:  1- Spindle does not lock so the analog time is off most of the time (no pun). 2- Never get it wet. It is not water resistant. A shower caused the light to stop working and the digital display is wack. Rice helped a little but not fixed.
3.0,they are too heavy
3.0,The cat pendant is very cut but the chain it comes on is very ugly! I nicer chain would make the piece really look better.
3.0,"This top is nice quality, soft, smooth fabric, well stitched.  I like it, but it's too small in the chest and arms.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 121 pounds, and I don't have fat arms, but this top is too tight in the arms.  I bought a size small, but I should have gotten a medium.  I have a small chest, but the chest is too tight.  It's too much trouble to return it, so I'll keep it."
3.0,Very harsh fabric and mostly see through. It softened up in the wash a bit. I'll need an undershirt to wear this one to work. Love the color though.
3.0,The band is actually ok quality but the fitting was a bit unappealing. Looks kind of small for the massive face of a Bradshaw.
3.0,The mask was huge!
3.0,Shipping to us takes a month . Other than that the earrings are nice and look great .After wearing for awhile there is slight irritation because the bar is thicker than a normal earring . If that makes sense .
3.0,great quality and very pretty but the size did not allow me to put them on!
3.0,Great quality. Fits smaller than expected.
3.0,"I wear an 18/20 and although that is the size it listed, it is a struggle to fit over my hips. Baaaarely goes. The bigger complaint is the mothball odor that I'm having trouble airing out of it."
3.0,"These run smaller than expected,  I just don't put them in the dryer."
3.0,I use them for dance rehearsal. Works well. But should be hand washed...washing with regular laundry destryoyed themüôÅ
3.0,But runs very small and short
3.0,Beautiful dress! But sizing was a little off.
3.0,It's not a true 4X<br />Sleeves are too snug on the arms
3.0,This sandal is to die for unfortunately the straps are not designed for thick legs nor calf.. Again the top 2 straps are not designed for plus size legs.. Man I hate that üòí
3.0,"The hat fit perfect, the print and construction is awesome. But it was shipped in a plastic bag and showed up out of shape and with a creased bill. Amazon says I can't return it after today (received it today) but I really need a hat for this weekend.  So I'm going to eat the cost. I won't buy Again unless Amazon switches to a box to ship it."
3.0,"Cheap, not a great qulity"
3.0,I wear a US 14 or xl and this fit like a size 10 It was  so disappointing because it was made well and so cute
3.0,"The masks were nice, but they were male adult sized rather than a kid‚Äôs size."
3.0,Purchased for hubby. It‚Äôs a decent shirt that dries quickly and fits nearly true to size. A little long IMO. It does look somewhat cheaply made. Most likely due to the printing on polyester shirt. At this price I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again.
3.0,I love the look of this ‚Äúsweatshirt‚Äù but it isn‚Äôt even close to sweatshirt material. It is more of a thin polyester shirt. Certainly not what I was wanting to purchase.
3.0,"WOW!  I didn't think it was possible for my 40 F cups to look flat, but somehow this suit did just that!!! I am a 16-18 and this suit was WAY to big.  I should have ordered a 2X.<br /><br />The color was beautiful! It was made wonderfully, but it was just SO big!"
3.0,Doesn't stay in place
3.0,scatchy on my neck....
3.0,"Wow, they're not kidding when they say these are maternity pants.  I don't know why the picture doesn't show a pregnant woman.  The foldover part is easily large enough to fold over a full pregnancy of multiples!  The material is nice and cozy, but the foldover length is too much for a regular, nonpregnant sized gal.  I had to give it a three because it is as described, but not a full five because the picture doesn't really represent the actual item."
3.0,My daughter loved these shirts however she normally wears a 3t shirt after reading the reviews I did size up and the 4t are still a little snug on her.
3.0,the little chain gets twisted
3.0,"Is not cute at all, the dress on the models in the pics must be altered because this dress is very ‚Äúboxy‚Äù and by no means flattering. Very thin material"
3.0,"While the wording was correct and is meaningful to me, the bracelet is disappointing because it isn‚Äôt black. It‚Äôs kind of a dark grey or faded black. I had one that my friend gave me and I broke it one day by stretching it too far.  So I ordered this, thinking it would be the same but it‚Äôs just not a strong black."
3.0,Really nice dress but like I said WAY too small!!
3.0,"Disappointed in the thin, flimsy material. Very large and unflattering."
3.0,Whatever size you think you are you're smaller in these pants.
3.0,"This dress is perfect. It fits well, the fabric is soft and it hangs naturally. It fits loose in a true babydoll style which is what I wanted. If you are looking for something fitted, this isn‚Äôt for you. I‚Äôm almost 6ft tall and it‚Äôs a little too short for the office.<br /><br />Update: I ordered two more of these. One in a different color and one sleeveless. I updated my review from 5 to 3 stars after I received them. They aren‚Äôt even close to the same dress. The one in a different color was a totally different material and cut. The sleeveless one was a similar material but cut much smaller. And, the sleeveless one shipped from China and returning it is a huge hassle."
3.0,"Very pretty, has a liner in it which makes it heavier than it looks. Fits more like a smaller medium"
3.0,Beautiful necklace...okay weight. Appears sturdy‚Äî I will see how it holds up.  I knocked off two stars because the earrings that came with them are so cheap!!!! I took them out of the cardboard holder and it already broke!! See pic attached .  Good thing i bought this for the necklace really!
3.0,"Pro- cute, different colors. Cons- run small, get a bigger or 2 sizes! They look dingy. I haven‚Äôt bleached them yet for fear of bleaching out the little trim color but they just look a little thin and no so bright white."
3.0,"I purchased this watch since I am a huge fan of wrist watches with the intention to wear something totally different, and I accomplished my intention. The watch is very nice loved the design and the quality is very good. I was a little disappointed with the case it was delivered since it is stained, but fortunately the watch itself was in good condition."
3.0,"This jacket served its purpose, but you get what you pay for. BOTH belt loops broke after only three wearings. The fabric feels a bit cheap - like felt. I needed a light jacket for a trip and this worked out fine and was warm enough for 50F degree temps. Purchase only if you're needing a jacket for (at most) one season."
3.0,low quality material
3.0,Don't last
3.0,It created water bubbles
3.0,"These boots are super cute, but they run small, so buy a half size or a size up. But great quality and price. I get comments on mine every time I wear them. I had to return for a bigger size, but the shipping both times was fast and a box, not just a bag."
3.0,"Way too long!! Now, I need to find a seamstress to hem the skirt so I don't trip over it! I'm only 5'4"", but it's way too long!!!"
3.0,"I was very excited to receive this. I bought one for me and two for gifts. My boyfriend and I opened one up together tonight.<br /><br />The box was very lovely and put together. From first appearances I'd say this was packaged very well. I took the oyster can and necklace cage out. I examined the cage and it was better quality than I expected for the price. Very happy there.<br /><br />I then proceeded to open the can with the oyster. This was so much fun for me. I then used the provided plastic to open the shell. It was a little tough to start but worked and popped open. I felt around with the little tool and the pearl popped right out.<br /><br />When I got the pearl out I wiped it off with a soft cloth and noticed it was not shiny. It was very dull and had crust on it. I tried to gently remove the crust but it would not come off. I was disappointed because this pearl is not one I'd ever wear.<br /><br />I would have rated this all 5 stars if it had a shiny pearl. I do give it 3 stars as it was a fun experience, the packaging was nice and the necklace was better than expected.<br /><br />I don't expect that all pearls are like mine. I just happened to get a bad one. It looked a lot like other fresh water pearls I've seen, as it was egg shaped (to be expected)."
3.0,"I like the design - for the price it seems very durable and easy to clean, while looking good. However, the adjustments are for massive wrists - it's loose even when I cinch it as tight as posisble, and my wrists aren't particularly small either. If this was an 1/2 to 1-1/2 inch smaller it would be perfect."
3.0,"I love the print, but this mask constantly slips upwards and the top edge stabs me in the eyes every time."
3.0,They ran small unfortunately. They were ‚Äúsuper‚Äù comfortable but the sizing was off and they didn‚Äôt have the next size up in stock.
3.0,I like the dress but it was very long.  I am 5'1&#34; and the dress was mid-calf.  I expected it to be closer to knee-length.
3.0,Not completely terrible but not great
3.0,Made for smaller wrists.
3.0,It's too big on my head
3.0,"3 Stars instead of 5.  Shorts arrived.  Condition excellent.  Communication good.  Size poor.  Would have considered them serviceable if they weren't too small for the sizing.  Company is out of the country.  Size chart is way off.  Ordered size M, which according to size chart is 32-34.  I understand S, M, L, XL, etc... being different for various places.  But you would think 32-34 inches is the same everywhere, obvious it isn't.  These shorts are extremely small.  Contacted company and arranged a return.  Got a 100% refund.  Company needs to correct sizing chart image.  Suggest ordering 2 sizes larger than your normal."
3.0,"Nice bag, but I returned mine, as it wouldn't hold a filtered water bottle (23.7 oz.) on the external beverage pouch."
3.0,It seems used
3.0,Disappointed that this is NOT made off the shoulder as pictured.
3.0,There are beautiful  but there so much species in it
3.0,Sadly runs small and I followed the chart. Nice material though.
3.0,"The material is heavier than we expected, but works. Both masks are smaller than we thought because they do not cover our noses, but these masks are still cute and a great choice for couples."
3.0,Giving my 4 year old blisters on his heel
3.0,I was expecting a dark green linen set but instead got a dark grey set. The shorts are definitely bigger in size than the shirt but overall still fit ok.
3.0,I was a little disappointed in how the bracelet looked but I would wear it.
3.0,Mask was smaller than expected. Eye holes not as large as they should have been. But for a quick cheap mask i didnt expect much.
3.0,The fabric cheap looking and you can see right through it.... Must wear a slip...the dress is okay
3.0,It was too tight  in the bust and it kind of looked a bit frumpy.
3.0,"I love that it‚Äôs a safe, natural product. That‚Äôs why I tried it. It brightened some of my jewelry, but the results on silver were not satisfactory. I had to resort to a stronger, chemical product that works within seconds."
3.0,Glasses have a good shape but when you put them on there is this annoying purple tint that gives me a headache and makes everything look unnatural
3.0,"These socks spice up a business-casual look, but the first time I put a pair on, they ripped immediately. Because they come in different mesh sizes, some of them are more durable than others. 75% of the socks worked for me."
3.0,I like the look and feel of these watch bands but sadly I have to return them because they don‚Äôt fit a smaller wrist. Ladies if you have a small Apple Watch band these are too long and won‚Äôt fit properly on your wrist.
3.0,"Gorgeous color. This top IS as attractive as pictured, barring size. I bought a small. At 5'3&#34; and 110lb; this is a tight fit. It barely covers the hips. Unless you're smaller than I am, I suggest you NOT follow suit. Size up, or be prepared to add lace!<br />Do NOT misunderstand me. The three stars relates to the smaller size. This is a GO-TO top."
3.0,"Though I do like the looks of the watch, the band is too big.  When I checked on having some links removed, I was told that it would cost<br />over 10 dollars, so I'm going to try to remove them myself and hope that I don't ruin the watch.  It makes me wish that I had purchased one<br />with an expandable band instead."
3.0,"cute jacket, soft, fits good... I still had to give the company 3stars because they sent me the wrong jacket. As you can see in the pictures. It's not the one pictured. I like shape of the back on the one pictured. Don't really care for the arched back on the one I recieved. Just might return"
3.0,"The suit was beautiful and great quality. Only issue was a med. sz. Women's 4-6 was so small, it wouldn't fit my 9 yr. tiny grand daughter. Was bought for a 0-3 sz. 16 year old. Definitely by up at least 2 szs. or more if you have any kind of curves or chest. Top is extremely sm."
3.0,Top is a bit short ( right under your boobs)<br />Pants fits kinda baggie
3.0,Got the eight pairs and a weird ‚Äúbonus‚Äù pair that says ‚Äúsunny days morning doing today?‚Äù  What?! Just weird. Glad I didn‚Äôt send these as a gift. Not sure I‚Äôll add the bonus pair in. They‚Äôre just weird looking cheap Chinese socks.
3.0,Oh my goodness! This was way shorter than I had anticipated it being! I thought it would flow past my knees but it stopped about 2 inches above! I am average at 5'5 height. Cute but I can't wear it to work.
3.0,Sizes run big. Over all it‚Äôs super cute
3.0,Gave it a three stars because it's too big for my wrist. But I'm keeping it because it's really beautiful.
3.0,It‚Äôs beautiful but the inside lining rips right out!
3.0,Only reason gave it a three star is the gold is starting to fade already.
3.0,"This is a great deal for the price. Quality is similar to juniors section clothing. It shows wash wear quickly which is why I gave it three stars. The fabric is soft and stretchy.<br />I ordered a small and it fits well. The back ends just at my hip and the front is lower, to the top of my thigh.<br />For comparison, I am petite hourglass 5ft and weigh 115. The sweater is not tight at all and not baggy either. The arms of the sweater are not wide so don‚Äôt buy this if you have thick arms."
3.0,It doesn't have as full a skirt as in the picture. But it's comfy so that's nice.
3.0,Was too large in the chest. The color was more orange than expected
3.0,Didn‚Äôt fit that well either...
3.0,"Based upon other reviewers comments, I sized down. The pockets hit my hip bones at an unflattering place. I might just stitch them up. This isn't the best cut for wide hips. That said, I bought this to wear as a nightgown, and it's soft, warm, and comfortable. You can tell the fabric will soften more with repeated washing."
3.0,"Warmers look nice, however, I ordered coffee and grey, but received burgundy and grey."
3.0,"There is no padding between sole and lining, but ok for money spent."
3.0,The material gets linty very quick
3.0,They fit snug mainly cause of my junk
3.0,I ordered the size I usually buy.  They are too small.  Since they stretch a lot I went ahead and tried wearing a pair.  Too small.  Very disappointed.  Wish I could return them.  I would take them in size that fits.  They are soft.
3.0,This product has issues.Legs and waist roll. Very uncomfortable.
3.0,These were too narrow for my feet so had to return them.
3.0,Arms are sort of too short And I have small arms
3.0,Fit and cut are okay. The fabric isn't great. It's that weird shiny stretchy material.
3.0,"I gave it as a gift , He loved it ... the the shiny color faded after a few months.. but nice"
3.0,Ordered a medium and should have ordered an XL.
3.0,To small and didn‚Äôt work like they said
3.0,Cute but you get what you pay for. The necklace and earrings faired pretty well but the ring turned my daughters finger green after two days of wearing.
3.0,Bands are great. The band strap holder tore/broke after about a week of wear (both black and purple). I do not wear them at night.
3.0,"The shirt is very nice quality. However the lace does not stretch like the rest of the shirt..feels odd wearing it. Also runs a little small..you may want to order a size up, unless you like tight fitting shirts."
3.0,I liked it but it did not fit.
3.0,I received them and one of the earrings sets had fallen out. I realize these are for little kids but when I receive a new product I expect them to not be falling apart when I get them.
3.0,I received the shoes look beautiful I hope they last a lot in this school year!!!!!
3.0,It‚Äôs a cute bag. The quality is not that great but you get what you pay for.
3.0,"Not the greatest quality hat, construction is a little wonky, but it‚Äôs okay."
3.0,"Slick style, the magnet could have been better fit."
3.0,These pants are very thick. And they fit a little baggy. The colors could also be more vibrant.
3.0,very thin material and shorter than I thought it would be
3.0,These might work for you if you like a solid foot bed with almost no flex.
3.0,It was pretty material but the shirt was very short and wide.
3.0,"nice fabric, but sized too small, typlically wear a large, but was either ""athletic"" fit or just a mistake, very disappointed."
3.0,Not what I wanted after purchase
3.0,"There are only jewels on one side of the handle. Still, it's a beautiful bag."
3.0,"I appreciate that these pants are made of an interesting lightweight material, and are intended for versatility with a universal look. However, the execution of these pants is quite lacking in quality and fit. I ordered these pants in my usual size 8 (I am 5'7"", 148lb, 30"" waist, 40"" hip). The wool fabric is very lightweight and not particularly insulating, a nice weight for all-day wear. They have a reasonably soft and non-itchy texture. The stitching seems ok through most of the pants except for the buttons and buttonholes, which are not very secure. Putting the pants on, they were WAAAAAY too tight in the thighs to the point of restricting my motion. As I wore them, they loosened up to become comfortable and looked great from the back. But then, as the fit loosened around my thighs and hips, the waist became looser as well. And, since these pants don't have belt loops (why???), you have to hope these pants fit all your proportions. Upon washing, the pants became tight again, and the wool fabric started pilling - after just one wash! My thighs rubbing together is already starting to weaken the fabric in that area. Honestly, given how expensive these pants are, I would hope they would be more durable. On the plus side, these pants do look nice and generally fit my proportions well enough for me to get some use out of them. But the durability is highly questionable, and these pants might not fit all body shapes."
3.0,slightly smaller than I expected. Cute for a young person.
3.0,the straps got extremely ratty after two washes.
3.0,"The suit is not bad and you can't beat the price.  However, the top seems very small. I ordered a large, because I typically have a difficult time finding tops that are big enough. I would say this suit would not fit anyone bigger than a B-cup. It seems to be made pretty well. If the top fit I would be completely happy with it."
3.0,These are the least true to size clothing  items Ive had to purchase... we had to do a bulk for a youth event and less then half were able to squeeze into these. I am a medium size 8-10. Had to reorder and still didn't fit into a &#34;large&#34;. These run very small.
3.0,"The tops are a bit small, however by ordering two sizes larger, they will work. Fairly descent value for the money"
3.0,"I do like this thing it's super tough. Problem is I bought for my girlfriend to clip on to her purse handle so she doesn't have to hunt around for her keys and I thought it would be bigger and easier to snap onto something. Right now she uses a hook and it gets caught on everything. Now I use this one for my keys and I got her a bigger one that's easier to open. So I had to give it only 3 stars, but would work excellent for a different purpose."
3.0,Ordered 3. Two fit  good but one pair the waistband keeps rolling down. They are all xL.
3.0,"for the price and description, it is good."
3.0,Narrow. Kind of uncomfortable. Narrow.
3.0,"Although the description of this hat has ‚ÄúNational Park‚Äù all over it, the hat is no where near the quality of the hats you would purchase at the national park welcome centers.<br />The fabric is lighter weight and the NP insignia on the front is a glued on decal rather than embroidered."
3.0,Not a solid construction.
3.0,"it was meh, i would pick something else lol"
3.0,it was a gift and I never heard from the person who received it. They have been traveling
3.0,A little disappointed in the quality. Seems a bit cheaply made and the material is what I would expect from a major discount store. I wish I would have spent about $5 more for a name brand. For a 2X it fits pretty snug for a hoodie.
3.0,They run small. Had to order a bigger size for my children. Is good quality but is the first time they run small.
3.0,"This runs very small for my two year old. She is 26 months in photo. We ordered size 2-3T. We had a smaller size for when she was 12 months and they fit fine for quite some time but when we went the next size up, it felt only slightly bigger and we had to buy another hat after 2 months. So either it runs small or my girl has a big head. She is tall for her age."
3.0,It‚Äôs decent. I expected to be the color in the photo but not even close! It was more of a burnt orange.
3.0,I like the skirt but came too small I had to buy an other one and I will returns the first one.
3.0,Good for sneakers not very effective with work boots
3.0,is not good material
3.0,It was smaller than expected.  I guess with form fitting shirts you should try it on before you buy it.  That leave OUT the internet.
3.0,"I bought it for my boyfriend and he wore it every day, It was tiny looking and it looked like something you get out of a vending machine at the grocery store.<br />The metal faded to a copper color quickly and the clasp bent out of shape easily, Eventually it fell off and he lost it.<br />I would recommend as maybe a once in a while thing but i wouldn't put a lot of special meaning or wear it every day."
3.0,This band lasted not even a month!
3.0,"I was a little bit upset to open the package and find only one mask! Definitely, not worth almost $20."
3.0,"I ordered a 32 it came with a tag that said 36, returned it new one was the same. Fits like a 34"
3.0,Can not read the small words.
3.0,"I love it, but it broke a couple weeks after I got it."
3.0,"The top is very soft, and I love the color, but it sheds. Even after washing, I get fuzz all over my pants and my seat belt strap."
3.0,"This product did not meet my expectations to the fullest.  They were very soft, stretchy and comfortable but I think they were too stretchy. They did not hold tight while working out so it was not a good fit for me.  They also didn‚Äôt hold up well when washed.  The pads inside the bra got all jumbled in a ball and could never get them to go back correctly.  If you just want these for comfort, then this is your product however I would not recommend for high impact workouts."
3.0,It's bulkier than I was hoping. It's very pretty though. I just think it's too big for everyday wear as I was hoping.
3.0,"The glasses arrived in a modified flat envelope, and when I opened the package one of he lenses was popped out of the frame.  I was able to put them back in, but I now wonder if the integrity of the glasses is compromised.  They are very lightweight and that sacrifices some of the strength, but they seem to be holding up so far.  I've only had them for about a week.  Time will tell."
3.0,"I am 5‚Äô4 and 125 lbs / 32b chest, I purchased the small and it was too large in every area. Even with a block heel on the dress was too long. I recommend sizing down."
3.0,Got it for my daugther and she loved but the pedometer doesn't work and battery drains in less than an hour so she just used for a bit to play with it before needs to charge.
3.0,The shirt is very big (wide and sleeve length) for the size it is. The accessories though are nice and a good start set for a tuxedo.
3.0,Good price but runs really small
3.0,"I returned the boots after a little debate.  The opening near the ankle is too wide.  It pulls the top down when walking and causes a significant crimp in the boot when standing/walking.  I tightened the laces as much as I could, but decided it was too annoying and returned.  The shoe and top parts both fit well and true to size."
3.0,Beautiful when worn. Not so beautiful after wash....
3.0,Nice fabric not cotton. Doesn‚Äôt feel feminine on me
3.0,"Nice necklace, looks good, may want to hand wash first before using--the leather cord bleeds lint whenever you adjust it."
3.0,They fit well but the light system didn't last long. They are holding up otherwise against a very active 6 year old.
3.0,"Packaging was a bit cheap, I would have thought being a gift it would have come in some sort of box to give rather than just a tiny zip bag. Had I not ordered something else with it, it may have gotten lost amongst the packaging!"
3.0,"torso length is good but the sleeves are a bit short: end right before where i would wear a watch, a good 2""/5cm before my wrist. good enough for basement rides on the trainer, though. seems to breathe okay despite the material being a bit thicker than other brands. size M fits snuggly, not race-fit, not loose. 5'11'""/183cm 175lbs/80kg"
3.0,Nothing like the picture but it's still cute arms are very snug for a xl
3.0,Coulda been better but hey it‚Äôs what you paid for
3.0,"Print was nice, was true to size.  No inside  lining."
3.0,"I like it, but i was hoping that it would be a liiitle longer"
3.0,"Nice gown, but runs very small."
3.0,"Bought for Halloween and came very fast! The costumes arms we so small I bent my arms and they split a little - now they fit much better but they‚Äôre tight to my arm. The quality is okay, I really held this to a high standard considering how much I paid, but I can add my own details to this until I am satisfied with the product, stitch more ruffles into the collar and buy a waist cinch so this fits better. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 140lbs and I might have been more comfortable with a L. Not Disney quality, but enough details are there for me to be satisfied. Buy a petticoat, it just does the whole thing justice. It did come with some flat bloomers, fingerless lace gloves and shoe covers. I bought nice boots, a parasol and petticoat to assist which was a smart move. I‚Äôm sure it will impress on Halloween. Now for my fianc√©‚Äôs costume to come in - Bert!"
3.0,works how it was intended
3.0,"I bought 2 of these for use in my retail flower shop. Nice aprons, keep your clothes dry. However, on one of the aprons the microfiber towel is coming detached and now the pocket is doing the same. The glue gun will save it but kind of a bummer.<br /><br />11/9/19 Update! After normal use in my flower shop the apron is thrashed, microfiber is hanging off and it looks terrible."
3.0,Returning! It was to small but ok quality
3.0,Almost impossible to close fully once in ears.
3.0,It's thin fabric but for the price okay.
3.0,Said size is true fit but large is way too small for me. Won‚Äôt even fitted my sister for her medium size.
3.0,It‚Äôs more white than pink.
3.0,Great thin comfy hoodie. Thin hoodie enough<br />To keep you comfortable during the fall. I loved it although it is missing pockets! I would purchase one in each color if it had pockets. Great color.
3.0,Quality is fine. The neck opening is too large and makes for awkward fit.
3.0,Each skirt fit differently one a bit too big one was snug . The fabric is what I expected a nice comfortable jersey knit they are nice skirts for the money .
3.0,Runs small. Returned an XL.
3.0,they look good but since they were too small can't give much more feedback
3.0,Ok so I thought that I would getting two rings but I guess it's only one! It's really nice and it spins smoothly!
3.0,"These are beautiful, shiny, sturdy, and very well made rings. I would give it 5 stars EXCEPT for the fact that these are very difficult to open."
3.0,"Nice design and love color change. Wish more handbags had this design. Sadly though that's about all this has going for it If your like me who has to carry more than slim items. Sizing is very off on this bag, labeled as large but its more of medium and not very wide"
3.0,"These are cute bras, but the material is not stretchy and doesn't ""give"" much. I ordered a medium because I'm a 34C and the material was very tight across my breasts and back and the band around my rib cage was kinda loose, so I returned them."
3.0,"I am normally a medium but I thought to get a large cos I wanted it loose. It is not loose. It did come up smaller than I wanted. Other than that, colour is brilliant. Need to. Wash it to see how it holds up though"
3.0,Really cute but very cheap so they'll break after pulling on it for a second
3.0,"The material is good quality, however color is much lighter than expected and the fit somewhat large. I ordered what was described as a US medium but it is obviously made for a larger fit. The shape would be much more flattering if the waist was taken in."
3.0,The color are great.  Cheap for replacing the lens and they give a screwdriver for each lens you order.<br /><br />Con: they can never compare to Oakley's
3.0,"I typically where a large shirt (16&#34;) neck size, but I recieved an extra large and it was too small.  I am going to try a 2X if they have it"
3.0,This shoe came with no charger.  my son loves the shoes because they light up.  what happens when they no  longer light up?  the shoe fits great.
3.0,"nice fit , but my shorts didn‚Äôt come with the belt as shown on the picture."
3.0,I ordered a 2xl (normally wear an xl ) and this fit like a large. The 3 shirts fit differently. One was a bit larger than the other 2
3.0,Decent quality but they rubbed on my eyelashes really bad. Had to return.
3.0,"Cream Color was nice and fabric quality was ok, but style is not really flattering for older women"
3.0,"The fabric isn't quite what I expected. It is stiff and has creases that did not come out after washing. And, since I washed it, I cannot return it."
3.0,I put on the navy pair and there was a run from the croch to the waist<br /><br />Colors are great<br />Fit is awesome<br />Very comfy<br />Just wish they were more durable
3.0,The length is fine don't get me wrong and I'd be able to wear the shirt if it wasn't for the stitching for under your chest (well it's SUPPOSE to be there) it hits mid-chest on me literally and it doesn't give my chest any breathing room at all which is a shame because I love the color and the length pretty much everything else about it.  I don't know if I can alter it a little or remove the stitching but if not I am going to have to return it.  The arms are a little small but I'm fine with that cause it's soft fabric.  Heads up it's not a forests green you can tell there's a little bit of blue in the green but it's still a great color.
3.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size up because I have a fairly large chest, 40C. I am 5'4 and weigh around 140. I got the Xl instead of the L, big mistake. It hung loosely on me like a scarecrow, I  didn't even need to use the zipper to get it on and off. Going back. Not going to reorder, as it also was much longer on me than the model. Fell arltvmy knees instead of 2 or 3 inches above like it did on her.  It even says Short in the description.  That length makes me look even shorter, not long-legged. So was not the slightest nit flattering and its such a pretty dress. I had the black one, never cared to wear white and I looked ready to attend a funeral,  not the image I was hoping for. In fact, I looked like I should be the main guest for a funeral.  So too large, too long and too drab. I doubt the smaller size would make that much of a difference.  If you're tall and blonde, go for it. It also took longer to arrive as well. Morticia must be popular. ."
3.0,Reasonable quality for the price.
3.0,"I was offered a sample of these sunglasses for my honest review.  First impressions were that it comes with a very nice and sturdy case (similar to cases I've received with my more expensive sunglasses) as well as a cleaning cloth.  The sunglasses themselves are honestly just okay quality.  All lightweight plastic similar to pairs you'd find at the check out as Walgreens.  I was supposed to receive ones with a blue reflective coating, but I could not see it at all.  Either that or I was sent the wrong pair.  Overall, an okay set of spare sunglasses and you can use the case for one of your nicer pairs of sunglasses."
3.0,my wife said its OK
3.0,This shirt is real short and wide it looks like a square.
3.0,The stones weren‚Äôt as bright of color as I thought they were ~ still beautiful
3.0,"They're beautiful; however they're far too large in the calves.  I had to mark them and then punch holes in them, so that they would fit properly.  For the amount of time I spent fixing them to fit me properly, I should've paid far less than what I did for them."
3.0,Smaller
3.0,I loved this set and my son was so excited to have pirate pjs however it runs very small and my kid is on the thin side. The arms are really tight and it fit him for about a month till he grew the slightest bit. I bought it in the size he was wearing at the time and even when he out grew this he still fit in that size in his other clothes.
3.0,A little small but I am satisfied with it. Very pretty.
3.0,They are kinda heavy and one of them broke. Thank God there were two pair. Overall I like em.
3.0,"Attractive band. Easy to install, but not very durable. I bought it at the end of November, and it‚Äôs broken already."
3.0,"Brass chain turns her neck green.<br />Medallion, love what it says.<br />With different material would be more than 5 star."
3.0,I am usually a small or medium.  I am 5'8  122lbs and 34C.  I ordered a Medium in this shirt.  This shirt is TIGHT... not wearable tight.  I am returning this and ordering an XL even at my stats.  It is very soft and cute but runs tiny.  Size up when ordering!
3.0,Nice hat but bad packaging hat us folded makes lines on brim
3.0,"It is very cute. The pendant looks same, only problem i had with it was the chain. It get stuck with the clothes"
3.0,Pretty cute.  Maybe I should have preferred a large size.  LOL
3.0,"This is a small, but necklace - perfect for my daughter's birthday. However, it isn't the best quality. The chain broke after wearing it two times. My daughter was careful with the necklace as it was special to her. She put it away each night after wearing it. When she went to put it on the third day, the chain broke. The charm itself is fine, but now we have to purchase a new chain for it."
3.0,"The bag is super cute, but it is much flimsier than it appears in photos.  I was hoping it would be durable enough to be a full time purse but it's really more decorative that for daily use."
3.0,The neckline was too high
3.0,"you get what you pay for, nice face for a watch, band is cheap"
3.0,Junior fit
3.0,Weird fit. Cups are scrunch. Look bad under t shirts.
3.0,Not well made very flimsy doesn't hold shape
3.0,"This product will work for my intended use (bridesmaid skirt), but I was hoping for something a little better. The picture makes the skirt look flowing and soft. The ones I receive (navy and blush) are not. They are very long and the tule is a bit stiff, maybe from packaging. I hope they get closer to my desired look with a steam clean or wash. Not a bad product, but not perfect either."
3.0,"Kind of odd fit, but can still make it work... material is not what I expected... a little heavy... but overall still a cute dress"
3.0,"The material is beautiful but it runs very small.  I'm 5'7"" and weigh 135 and I couldn't get it over my shoulders.  I ordered the Large since I went by their measurements.  I had to return it since it didn't come in any larger sizes.  Honestly I would have been skeptical to order anything smaller than 2 sizes up.  Would be a great costume for a child"
3.0,Not exactly the quality I was<br />Hoping for
3.0,"Quality is good and fit is nice, if a little snug (order up a size if you are waffling) but the red - which is definitely true red in the photos - is more of a rust.  The dress I bought thinking it would be great for a holiday party may still be, so long as it‚Äôs Halloween and not Christmas!"
3.0,Got them and they look good but the shoes I was going to use them on I had to return!!! So we‚Äôll have to wait and see!!
3.0,It‚Äôs a lot larger than expected & chain has broken 3 times already :/
3.0,Broke 3 hours after I first wear it
3.0,Ordered my exact size but my toe kept rubbing the front and I couldn't see myself walking in these for any length of time.  Had to return them sadly.
3.0,This skirt was an awkward fit for my teenage daughter. We sent it back and got a refund.
3.0,Likes the way they looked but was way to small
3.0,Runs narrow. Returned it.
3.0,Two of the chains have broke off and the lace on top rips way to easy when trying to put them on. Only worn them a few times and only for a few hours. The legs are long but I'm short 27 inch inseam. I need to shorten probably at least 3 inches.
3.0,"The quality is good but the post is too long so you can see it inside my nostril. I'm not all that experienced in mouse jewelry, so maybe there's sizing for post lengths...? I suppose if you have a thicker nostril this would be great?"
3.0,"IM SEEM TO BE HAVING A VERY VERY HARD TIME WITH THIS ZIPPER, TO TRY ON I HAD TO PUT IT OVER MY HEAD, TO TAKE OFF I HAD TO SLEP OUT OF IT. NOW WHAT I SUPPOSE TO DO. THE ZIPPER DONT WORK LOT OF MONEY. I REALLY LOVE THIS COAT THO. THE PIC IS ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE. TY WHAT SHOULD I DO ?"
3.0,"I wear a 14 but I'm short and the reviews I read to order up becuase these pant run small and shrink, so I ordered a 3x in tall, they did shrink length wise so now they are the perfect flare length but the 3x was way too big and they keep sliding down. It sucks because I really like them, they're comfortable, the color is as pictured and while the material isn't top quality it's perfect for the price and for work. Will probably pen the waist and see how it goes."
3.0,All the images aren't completely clear some of the colors are off of the character Caleb and Sofia. Would have liked them to be a little bit clearer.
3.0,"My niece really liked this bracelet (which I purchased at her request).  However, I thought it was quite insubstantial for the money paid.  She liked that it is white gold, and hence won't tarnish like silver would.  But it's a very thin, lightweight bracelet."
3.0,I really got it for the top but thought the bottoms were cute. 34c and the top is a perfect fit.  However I‚Äôm a size 6 jeans and the bottoms don‚Äôt cover much of anything. Trying to contact the seller.
3.0,"Super super cute, but you have to pull the neck hole over your hips, there's no other way in, and that's extraordinarily inconvenient. I usually wear a 12-14 and this fit pleasantly well. I can just imagine the stretch on the high neck collar after having to pull it over my hips so often."
3.0,"Band has frayed quickly.  One of the band loops came off on week 2.  Seems cheap.  On the other hand, watch case I have no complaints."
3.0,too small..but my niece loves it
3.0,"This bracelet is all right, but it is significantly cheaper looking than the photo.  Also, the stones are lighter than what is pictured."
3.0,"Lovely colour and design by it was really too big. Also, it's thinner than I expected, not a true knit fabric."
3.0,Like the size of the face. Don't like the band it us to small
3.0,I have a 7 edge and it was too small. I returned it and received a refund. But I will say that it was very pretty and of good quality.
3.0,"I wanted to like these gloves because of the foil ""bling"". The colors and fabric were passable.  But they didn't fit. So unfortunately I had to return these gloves."
3.0,they were supposed to be 12-24 month socks. they were so large that my 3 year wears them. other than that they are great socks
3.0,"This garment fits as expected. Color a bit duller than pictured. It has one shining feature that I gave 3 stars. Ladies, it has POCKETS! Not quite deep enough for the newer oversized phones but my iPhone fits nicely.  Unfortunately the wrinkles are stubborn and difficult to get out.  Won't reorder this tunic top."
3.0,"3 stars for the comfort, cloth material, and price. Missed two stars because the first day I wore it, the front main metal button broke and fell off!? Luckily it has a back up plastic inner button that I can use. Might as well spend an additional $30 to have legit 5.11 that is field tested."
3.0,"These are not kids sizes.  They may fit high school students, it fit me (adult female).  The masks were cute though."
3.0,Gave this item only three stars because the workmanship is great but the leather smelled of mildew. The pricing was ok but I will not be ordering any more until the vendor can get rid of the smell.
3.0,"Don‚Äôt really like the hem it‚Äôs raw with stitching around it was the ties aren‚Äôt long enough to wrap around the front you have to tie in the back. You get what you pay for ordered extra large, could have gone with a large. 100% cotton so material is a little stiff but I prefer cotton"
3.0,"I really loved this earring. The tree was beautiful and the diamonds were so vibrant for the price. Unfortunately, the tree was too large for my ear so it was extremely uncomfortable. It was so painful, I finally had to just take it out. Really wish my ear was a bit bigger lol but I'd still recommend buying it."
3.0,"Cute T shirt, however kinda cheap."
3.0,"The clasp was not secure.  Kept falling off my wrist.  However, the seller was easy to work with and prompt."
3.0,Not supportive enough for running.
3.0,A nice fabric but came very creased and wrinkled and so it looked a bit like an ugly Halloween costume until I managed to iron it out. Which was also very hard to do.<br />Still it looks lovely and I adore the waist on it.
3.0,I think on this ring that the picture actually looks better then the ring. The price was awesome though. The ring does run a little small I think. I am not sorry I purchased the ring though.
3.0,"These gloves are very soft, the fit nice, the fingers just a tad long. BUT, they did not do much for keeping my hands warm. They are thin which makes them comfy, but ineffective for warmth."
3.0,"I love the design. It looks great and feels good. Buuuuuut...they do run small. I ordered the XL, XXL, and XXXL. The XL was up on my belly button. The XXL and XXXL were exactly the same size and run short. They only barely go below my belt line."
3.0,Looks nicer in pictures then actual watch.
3.0,"Didn‚Äôt like the straps. The tighter you made them, the more they came off track. Was a little see through but nothing horrible."
3.0,Not as beautiful as expected but Ok. I guess for the price
3.0,"I bought two of these. So pretty, stamped with 925 for sterling silver...both lost a stone in less than a week. :*( Both returned. I guess inlaid stones in an adjustable ring doesn't really work."
3.0,pretty but chain too short to fasten around my ankle.
3.0,Okay.  A bit 'stretchy' for my liking.  Was trying for a look outside of the box for me.  Its okay.
3.0,"I bought these for their hot air balloon pendants.  I would replace the chains.  The pendants aren't perfect, but for the price they are good enough."
3.0,"Outfit did not fit as a boatneck as expected for me or my girls. We did enjoy it, but were expecting a different look."
3.0,"I was super excited about this because it was sooo soft and comfortable when I first put it on. I got it because I am breast feeding and the regular old t shirt I was sleeping it was just not codusive/convenient. at first this was seemingly perfect and exactly what I wanted, however after my first wash there was already a button missing. I don't see this holding up and I don't think it's worth $30. too bad. so comfortable and exactly what I needed."
3.0,"If you are tiny and with small breasts the picture will be accurate fit. But I am curvy with larger breasts and the cleavage was not for mixed company. No stretch on fabric and no way to make it more modest other than a tube bra underneath, and that would look weird. Its cute but I suggest for smaller sizes."
3.0,A bit smaller than expect I had to get them for my work I have a vurtical labret (my lip) haven't tried them yet . I'll wright another one after I try!
3.0,"Nice looking but hard on the feet, I didn‚Äôt like that"
3.0,"This doesn't have a ton of give to the fabric. It is also very long, so if you are part giraffe it will work extremely well."
3.0,"I sent this bra set back because the bra cups were slightly too large and the underwear was too tight. The sizing on the bra is really not the fault of the product. I'm a 34 AA, but because bras often don't come in that size, I tried to make the 32 A work. The band was unsurprisingly too tight, and because the bra doesn't have any padding, the mesh was unflatteringly puckered. I thought the bra was not as translucent in life as it looks in the picture. The underwear should have fit in a small size, but it was quite tight."
3.0,"Looks really cute, but the effiel  is really small in size and the necklace is short in length. Good size for a preteen."
3.0,Got these to try out at work as I‚Äôma forklift driver. Wanted something that was light and still had a steel toe to it. These fit the bill for that. The only downside is that they are kind of wide in the front of the shoe. Are nice and light though which is a major plus when driving stand up forklifts. However it does make driving my car kind of difficult since the gas/brake pedals are super close together. Other than that they‚Äôre a decent pair of boots
3.0,Disappointing to see the tag when I paid double.
3.0,top part fits as expected but bottom part is kinda too loose or large for me
3.0,"Cute hats, lightweight. Got these for the value but I have to spend another $7 for fishing line that was suppose to come with these."
3.0,"The patterns were pretty, however I was disappointed with the width...  in the photos the bands look much wider."
3.0,Little smaller than I expected.  However I can make it work.
3.0,It looks nice and clean but I was expecting better quality for this price.
3.0,Super pretty but looks fake. It‚Äôs fine as an accent but don‚Äôt plan an outfit around it.
3.0,"They stretched out after a couple of months and now I'm flopping all over the house. I've washed them in the machine. Don't think that contributed to them stretching out. At first they were great and now not so much. I'll eventually look for other slippers. Until then, I'll just keep flopping. Haha."
3.0,"Very comfortable on my 5'4"" 170 lb frame and looked good. Waist band stays in place when I sit then stand (similar fabrics I own slide down.) I bought three but soon noticed they seem to have a short inseam, although18"" is what the spec describes. I measured all 3 and found the longest is 17"" and two others slightly less. This is the only reason I gave 3 stars, because if you are taller than me this brand may not work well for you."
3.0,Ordered it in a L . It was way too small for a large. It fitted my daughter who is a size 6. I have to return it.
3.0,"I liked the product, yet it had some issues such as ‚Äúriding up‚Äù...It is wearable and pretty comfortable but I would not invest in another one."
3.0,"For the price, it looks great. I listened to reviews and ordered size up. I'm 5ft 6 in 130 lbs. ordered M and just fits."
3.0,It was nice however the chain broke on me just recently.
3.0,They don't seem as tight as other compression socks I have tried
3.0,"I THOUGHT I PUT IT ON BACKWARDS, SO I TURNED IT AROUND AND IT GOT WORSE. I WEAR IT ANY WAY BECAUSE IT PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED."
3.0,"These are small, thin and light. They are 12mm which I think is the smallest hoop you can get without squeezing your earlobe. 1 to 2mm room between earlobe and hoop. They are Rhodium plated .925 sterling silver. Many jewelry manufacturers mix silver with nickel these days to increase shine and prevent the greening you get with copper. So those of us with nickel allergies can no longer wear sterling silver. However the rhodium plating on this prevents an allergic reaction. I have been wearing them for a week, sleeping and taking showers with them. No allergic reactions so far, no redness, swelling, crusting, itching or scabbing. I think I have found the perfect solution for keeping my piercings unclogged.<br /><br />The clip opened and I lost one. $15 is an ok price so I got another."
3.0,This band is not like the stars are promoting it is a lot smaller in the width it is the width of an ace bandage the length is good it still will do the trick
3.0,Way too long to wear with leggings. Im 5' 5 and it goes to my knees.
3.0,"Not as easy to put on or keep on as the ad/video show. Starts to lose their ""snap"" fit quickly & won't bend over the ear & stay in place. When I can get them on & snapped or bent to lock them on, they are warm, keep the wind out & it's almost like wearing nothing. Better than a cap, they don't mess up your hair or makeup, they don't slide up or down over your eyes & are wonderfully soft. My ears do get sore spots from them though, so maybe I ordered the wrong size. They are a cool idea & I might consider trying another size to see if they fit & stay on better. Thank you."
3.0,I love the fabric and the style but it is really long. I am a seamstress but the way it is made is not conducive to altering the length so I did send it back. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4 so this dress would be better for a taller person unless you simply like a longer style. But the bottom line is that it does not fit length wise as shown on the fit model so I am guessing she much be quite tall. üòÅ
3.0,"This seems like it would be a great belt, but upon receipt I had my children try them on and they were WAY to small. I even measured them to make sure to get the correct size. I ordered the medium thinking they would have room to grow in them. My children measure 27 and 28 inches around the hips. The product description clearly states that it measures 30-32 inches. I will be returning these for an XL as I do feel they will work for us, just wish the sizes where correct so I didn't have to go through the return process and wait for the new product to arrive."
3.0,"I wish I looked at the photos more before I got this. The threading is really thick heavy threads spread apart and not very classy. A bit large too. I washed it and put it in the dryer and it shrank and fit much better, the last 2 pics are after wash... its an OK shirt."
3.0,"I like the looks of them, they look nice... however, the beads slide all over and do not stay in place.  I would have made them so they stay put. I also don't like the long ties hanging. I have small wrists, so I have to wrap the ends around several times and tuck under the braclet.  Then it's a hassle to take them off. I will be putting regular clasps on them and secure the beads better. If you have thick wrists, this shouldn't be an issue."
3.0,"Normally wear a sz 9 so ordered a 9 and they're too big. A sticker on them said 41, so I believe that's a sz 11 in EU. No where on the order details can I find verification of me ordering a size 9, which is ridiculous.  Cheaply made but what do you expect for $35?"
3.0,I ordered these shoes 1/2 size bigger and there beyond small when I tried them on.  Need to buy at least one size big or even 1 1/2 size to 2 sizes big.  The general feel was good but I did not try to run in them.
3.0,"Cute but runs small, order a full size up."
3.0,It's OK. The pearls are a bit smaller than I expected but alright.
3.0,"These item is not the burnt orange as it appears on the picture. The pattern is more whimsical than I prefer. I‚Äôm 59 and 255 post baby and 2xl was huge on me. I will be returning, but I do love the length of this dress."
3.0,"Loved the pattern and disliked the stitching. It was great until‚Ä¶ poor stitching, had ended up hand sewing it back on because we were leaving on our trip the next morning. I had no time to return, if the stitching was perfect then I would have rated this a 5 star."
3.0,"Got in my size (medium), it is way too wide. Returning. Would look good in a small. Also it does require a cami - pretty much completely see-through."
3.0,"I have what i would consider M to S hands.  I ordered L and wished I had ordered XL.<br />However, these are great for handling and polishing your favorite things."
3.0,Band was too small but i like it
3.0,"Red Wing is definitely a trust worthy and great brand, but delivery of this product was not ideal!<br /><br />1) The package arrived damaged.<br />2) The product came inside of a plastic baggy where oil from the product had spilled inside of it. (Made the product seem like it came used) Maybe it was the damaged package? An issue with the courier? I guess we'll never know, but it looks like others have had this issue.<br />3) Because of the oil spill inside of the baggy, the tin can wasn't pleasant to touch. The oil also got all over my clothes, so be careful opening!!<br />4) Other than the failed delivery, the product is great and applies well on my Red Wing Heritage Iron Ranger boots. (Style No. 8111)<br /><br />I would have given a 5 star review but delivery of the product left me to a 3 star &#34;It's Okay&#34; review.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
3.0,I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 145lbs.  I bought a medium and it was too tight in the stomach area.  I got the apricot color.  Felt maybe it was see through a bit too.
3.0,I love the look of the shoe but they were narrow and ran small for my son's foot.
3.0,Very thin kind of a pencil shape.  Not fond of it.
3.0,Est√°n muy anchos y los quieren como proteccion
3.0,Great top not a good fit for me
3.0,Really liked it but lost it within a week poor clasp
3.0,Purple star.<br />Cute and cheap for a 10 year old child.<br />Very sparkly.
3.0,"These socks are super cute! I've gotten many compliments on these. They even look cute when mismatched (yes, I've gotten compliments on mismatched socks). They work great for boat shoes and Keds since the non-slip silicone grip works as advertised. I can run, dance and jump around in these and the socks magically stay in place. So why the three stars? Unfortunately, the silicone grip is a double-edged sword. As well as they work to keep the socks in place, they wrap too tightly around the feet, which makes wearing these socks very uncomfortable after a couple hours. I had to change socks on a couple occasions because my feet started hurting. One of the socks also started tearing after two wash. Durability is not one of their strengths."
3.0,"The quality of materials is good, and the housecoat is made well, but lt's longer and less roomy than the other Swirl Models Coat. I like the collar better than on the others, but I would really appreciate having more wiggle room!"
3.0,"had to return, didn't like the look"
3.0,I am 5ft and I ordered a small. It was to big in the sense of too wide and way too long. I did not want to altered this skirt because I would have lost the entire yellow at the bottom. The colors were vibrant and nice and the material is silky and of good material. I only wish they made it for short people. I would recommend this skirt.
3.0,I got this same top in a different color and this one fit completely differently. The fabric is stiff and it runs small.
3.0,Like it. It's simple and goes with any outfit however it doesn't stay where I put it. It constantly loosens and I always have to adjust it.
3.0,"Wore it for snowboarding twice. It was very warm and I like the color, but the material sticks to my beanies and clothes. It makes a mess‚Ä¶"
3.0,"Wish it was a little longer. It's way above the knee.  I am 5'5"", a medium and 150 pounds. Cute dress tho!"
3.0,"To short to be a dress period! But, Made üòç Cute! Nice yellow color!"
3.0,"They are good, but they got scratched day one when dropped by the pool.  The mirror coating is super sensitive."
3.0,"I was hoping these tights would be more compressing. Also the pocket is really small. Too small for iPhone 10. Not very happy with these, will wear them for gardening or walking the dog, but not for running or working out."
3.0,"Bought this for my wife‚Äôs Garmin S4 golf GPS watch.  Nice band and good replacement, however, the tools provided were worthless as they did not fit the watch band pins.  Ended up have to take to watch repair who had the right size tools, which was a pain.  Can recommend the band but be prepared to have a jeweler make the switch."
3.0,Shorts fit great for the gym but one of the pockets was sown upside down so I only have one packet available.
3.0,"It's a beautiful bag but very,very heavy!"
3.0,"elegant short set, but the middle was a bit too large. The decoration on the chest of the outfit was stunning. I had to return this item."
3.0,"I wanted to like this, but the hips seemed misshapen. I don't have a real curvey hourglass figure, and the fabric bunched up and stuck out around my hips. Otherwise, fabric is thick but still kind of soft and it would look great if i had the ol' child-bearing hips."
3.0,I normally wear a medium and after reading reviews went with the large.  I was very surprised how smalll the large was and should have gone at least an x-large.
3.0,Look good. Doesn‚Äôt keep hands warm. I can‚Äôt use in touch screen
3.0,"Skirt is very full, a lot more material in it than I was expecting.  I probably should have ordered a size smaller but was afraid it would be too small."
3.0,Have a few rose gold pieces. The picture I posted is my rose gold next to the bracelet. As you can see the color difference. This is a pretty gold diamond bracelet. It is not rose gold. Please remove rose gold from description.
3.0,Great quality and cute! Way too small.
3.0,Had to return them. They were very small though I ordered a large. Disappointed. Now we‚Äôre scrambling to get another pair before our trip.
3.0,"I don‚Äôt notice when I bought it, but the front says keep America great"", just an FYI. It‚Äôs pretty hard to see through, but serve the purpose of keeping wind or ac from blowing in your face/eyes. That‚Äôs why I bought it. Not bad looking."
3.0,Not nice material.
3.0,Very cute! The material is not high quality but for the price it's okay and still wearable.
3.0,Literally love the style of this bag. Only thing is that one of the gem things came off and I had to super glue it back on which was pretty disappointing but what can you expect from amazon.
3.0,"Good value, good timekeeping. I returned because of 1) non-rotating bezel 2) non-screw down crown and 3) upside down printing of ‚Äú20‚Äù, ‚Äú30‚Äù and ‚Äú40‚Äù markers on bezel. Just too ‚Äúfake‚Äù for me. But I loved solar charging. Price excellent. Well made."
3.0,Very large for kids frames.
3.0,These look nice but as they are not real silver the open rings break easily
3.0,"This dress looks great in the photos but it was wayyyy too small, and as someone who is on the taller side (5'8&#34;, 165 #) the 8 did not fit at all. The dress was definitely pretty and the quality seemed fine for the price, but it was not something that I thought was appropriate for someone my height."
3.0,"Super cute but starts to become loose during workouts of high intensity, also- pulls and gets caught on sweaters and long sleeves.. messed up a couple of my sweaters :-/"
3.0,Cut circulation off in foot and caused a blister. Not for me
3.0,"It is a great looking hat. I have received compliments on it. The fit across the bill is tight. The left and right edges seem to go father back around my temple area and it ends up feeling tight no matter how loose I adjust the retaining Velcro strap in the back. It may just be that I am used to wearing a hat lower on my forehead that this particular style is fit for.<br /><br />When I wear the hat farther back on my forehead the tightness does disappear. Unfortunately, I wear hats for the shade they afford my older eyes and wearing it farther back on my forehead reduces its shading effectiveness.<br /><br />So this hat will beautify my room more than anything else. The service and shipping times are first rate. I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone who asks. Hats are like people. We all fit a little differently into life and hats fit differently on heads."
3.0,Is a very pretty piece of jewelry. Did not expect heart to be so big like a trinket box. Will not wear but is one of a kind item.
3.0,"Don‚Äôt have much to say since they were too big for my son, maybe size down."
3.0,"Face cover was cheap looking, so I didn't use it. Loved the band until it completely fell apart on my wrist while driving......"
3.0,"I'm a medium. After reading reviews, I got an XL. Thank goodness, but the neck is still too tight."
3.0,This suit is very cute but unfortunately I am a 4‚Äô8 girl who is 87lbs and it did not fit me well. It was very big on and ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL PEOPLE!!! But overall very cute but not for my body type.
3.0,Meh. A little too baggy and the crotch is too long. Look like some dance crew pants.
3.0,"Product: Aimeilgot Mens Hipster Hip Hop Casual Short Sleeve Tee Solid Soft Cotton Irregular Hem T-Shirt<br /><br />Oh my goodness, this shirt. It looked cute in the picture, but not really in person. The concept is great, but the implementation ends up looking sloppy and like it was slapped together by someone who was just learning how to make a shirt. It just looks strange.<br /><br />I knew the hem was asymmetrical when getting this shirt, but the longest point of the hem is more to the side than is shown in the pictures. It ends up looking like someone couldn‚Äôt cut the hem straight and doesn‚Äôt look like it was intentional. The seam down the front looked like a good accent in the picture. In reality, it looks like they ran out of material and used scraps to finish the shirt. The bottom hem is raw, which I didn‚Äôt really notice to be honest when I ordered the shirt. It curls up a lot, adding the overall sloppy look to the shirt. It curled more after washing.<br /><br />Speaking of washing‚Ä¶there are no instructions on the shirt. The instructions in the description run the gambit from hand wash only to machine wash. It is a 100% cotton t-shirt, so that means it will go in the washer for me. The color faded after a couple of washing. The pictures are after the shirt had been washed and worn a couple of times.<br /><br />All of the above is a shame because the rest of the shirt is made well. The fabric is a nice, soft cotton. It is not a thin, cheap material.<br /><br />This shirt has ended up being used as a sleep shirt or shirt used when working around the house."
3.0,"I ordered a 2x. The bottom was fine, maybe a little long, hard to tell I'm only 5'2. The top was way too small. I am a D cup and my boobs were squished flat and oozing out of the top. Not sexy cleavage, weird flat cleavage."
3.0,The large is still pretty small. It barely fits. My wrist and I got it for my husband.
3.0,"It feels like a really good quality mask it‚Äôs just small. I wouldn‚Äôt call it one size, it should be listed as small."
3.0,I had to return this item. It was torn at the seam and not repairable.
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and they were too short above my knees, I was hoping they would be a little longer"
3.0,"Love the arch support but since I wear a bigger size, the straps across to top are too loose and my foot slides around. Not great for long skinny feet."
3.0,gag
3.0,"Item is very cute but seems to be labeled wrong as far as the size goes. My daughter is a 2T, I purposefully bought a 3T hoping it would fit her for a while and it fits like an 18M dress. It‚Äôs snug and very short. Sizing needs to be checked."
3.0,"It is cute, but very thin. I have to find something for her to wear under it."
3.0,gentle cycle and  line dry
3.0,Pretty and I love the front close but there is way too much padding. I feel likI‚Äôm wearing pillows so I only wear it when I want extra extra padding.
3.0,Small!
3.0,This is cute! BUT I missed the zipper in the BUTT!!!  It‚Äôs a little uncomfortable
3.0,Didn‚Äôt notice the pointy tips at each end.  I was going for an ‚ÄúEyes wide shut‚Äù kind of vibe but got a ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù look instead so I didn‚Äôt use it.  Still good quality.
3.0,Wife loves
3.0,"Very nice dress, I gave it a 3, because, I didn't like the way the front bust area fit. However that's personal for me, others loved it"
3.0,"It looks kind of awkward, and the material feels weird - not cotton or denim, as advertised. I'm putting it through the wash to see if the odd texture or stiffness goes away."
3.0,"Love these glasses, these are my second pair. Worth the money. Although they failed to include the &#34;free microfiber pouch&#34; with BOTH shipments."
3.0,The only thing I would change is the thin zipper! If you pull to hard you will break it.. otherwise very cute!
3.0,Great sunglasses in terms of mimicking the pictured advertisement and being sturdy- but this shape is unique and will not fit all face shapes. It is a  little odd but is an acquired shape.
3.0,Not as transparent as I was expecting
3.0,"The lenses are fine. They do cut glare and perform as expected. BUT!!!  The frames emit a toxic solvent/chemical smell that is very strong. I initially thought it would lessen after being out of the plastic packaging but it did not.  Even after several weeks in my car in varying temperatures they still smell strongly. Just picking them up to put them on circulates enough airflow that you can smell them throughout the car. Makes me wonder if they are a health hazard.  Overall, the toxic fumes kind of over shadow the performance benefits."
3.0,"I'm pretty disappointed bc this skirt was super cute but unfortunately, it doesn't fit. I'm 5'6, 145lbs and usually a medium fits well for me. Go a size up from your average size."
3.0,Poorly made. Top button did not line up properly
3.0,I like them but they‚Äôre hard to put on.
3.0,This top fit like a tent. Not a good look.  I'm a slender person but I couldn't make this work.
3.0,"Looks great on, but the second band is constantly sliding underneath the Apple Watch and disconnecting it from my wrist. Also the band isn't as long as you'd expect to fit all wrists. I am 9 months pregnant so my wrists are a little swollen and I'm on the last notch while with my regualar L Apple Watch band I have 3 notches left. If you're looking for a stylish band this is great but it does take away the hr function and if you have a passcode set on your watch you either need to turn it off or type your password in every single time you look at your watch."
3.0,The color is a little deceiving. It's a little lighter and less tan than the picture.
3.0,Really awesome earrings. but they are REALLY HEAVY. And the way they hang you see the back of the earring most of the time instead of the goats head. Would have been better if the goat head was on both sides so it would always show.
3.0,A little tight.. covers my arms well but not my arm pits. Its cute tho
3.0,"Fit great, look great... Didn't last that long. The shoe had completely fallen apart which is a shame because they look good quality. My toddler wore them maybe a few times a week and she's not a rough kid.<br /><br />Edit: Seller sent me a new pair to try. So far they seem good, she's only worn then a few times. Time will tell and I'll update again if they don't last. 3/21"
3.0,The leotard runs  small not unless the person u are purchasing for is very small. I was purchasing for a 4' 11in  88lb child. The leotard is stretchable thank God but I should have ordered one size up. The quality is great & not sheer.
3.0,"I bought this for my Casio [[ASIN:B009KYJAJY Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200M Duro Analog Watch, Black]].  Looks great, but installation was tedious.  The spring bar became bent and kinked during installation and I am not 100% confident about the strength/integrity of the watchband."
3.0,"One came broken, other one was good but was too small for my wrist"
3.0,"Runs way small in the bottom. I'm a 12/14 and ordered an XXL because I have booty. I recieved an XL and it's way too small. Gave it to my daughter who's a size 6 and it fits her super cute. Bummer for me because it's more my style, but at least I could gift it."
3.0,The size was ok in the shoulders and chest but they are very short in length. I'm a little disappointed but I will not return. After looking at the picture of the item they do appear to be short.
3.0,Teen size - not child
3.0,Tight in the breast area the rest of the dress fits like it says. Nicely made material. Don‚Äôt want to return due to the hassle.
3.0,"Fits well and the graphic brings a grin to people who see it. The material, while very soft, is VERY thin. Given this, I‚Äôm a bit concerned about accidentally snagging it on something minor and causing a major ‚Äúwardrobe malfunction.‚Äù"
3.0,Pretty rosary for the price. Turned color after a while
3.0,These run a little wide I think. I would like the backs to be a little higher. Otherwise OK for the price.
3.0,These are a nice pair of women's gloves with little rhinestone on the top of each glove.  The gloves are of good warmth.  The reason I only gave these gloves 3 stars is because we could not get our phones to work with the gloves on.  Nice gloves but not touch screen.
3.0,Ships from China (order a month in advance). Definitely not hand made. Coloring is a bit dim.
3.0,"The color is light blue, not the mint color as pictured."
3.0,"I have bought items before through similar companies and they always ended up to small so I ordered a XL and a L would have been perfect. The  material is ok, I think an ok shirt over all for the price."
3.0,Short in the legs and long up too.
3.0,Nice shirt but the 2x fit like a large and it had very tight sleeves. I gave it to my son.
3.0,Fits small. A little disappointing because it's a cute top. Fits small and had a lot of strings hanging from the inside.
3.0,Returned because it hung funny and material was not soft. Not as flattering as others I‚Äôve purchased. A little too short for 5‚Äô8‚Äù tall person.
3.0,"Dress fit me perfectly, size small, I am 5'5"" and it lands right at my ankle. I noticed after washing in cold, delicate, hang dry, that the tie ends were frayed. After looking again at the dress photos and description, I see that I am missing the tassels!"
3.0,"I have bigger calf muscles and these were extremely tight, to the point i couldnt fit them all the way on. So, if you have bigger calfs too, i wouldnt recommend these."
3.0,I probably expected too much for that price.<br />The chain doesn't seem sturdy enough for my twelve year old granddaughter.<br />We'll see how it holds up.
3.0,"Weird fit. It is kind of hard to explain...shoulder straps too short, neckline too high? Maybe it's just me?"
3.0,"Decent dress and good quality. My only issues was I ordered the dress too small and the return process is a headache.  Not to mention my dress came with BLACK stains all over it. Not really tripping about that part, because I had plans on washing it before wearing it. Unfortunately my sis inlaw to be chose these dresses for the bridesmaids, because getting the sizes right and them being sent from another country is a real headache."
3.0,Alittle tight. Size up! But great material!
3.0,Comfortable but not flattering for me
3.0,"This skirt fit okay, but it did not look like it does in the picture.  It seems much more cheaply made in person, and as others have noted, it doesn't actually reach the ground.  I'm only 5' 2&#34; and it STILL didn't reach the ground on me.<br /><br />It's also got some weird, sharp edges where you wouldn't expect them.  The deepest layer is just a straight-across miniskirt, but it puffs out a bit and looks odd with the layers over it, like it's competing for attention.<br /><br />I returned this as soon as I tried it on since I knew it wouldn't work for the pirate costume I was putting together.  I ended up finding a much better skirt for my purposes.  I'm sure there are some people who this skirt would work for, but I'm not one of them!"
3.0,Fits great when first put on.  Then stretches and doesn‚Äôt stay up
3.0,I liked the Charms but the issues that I have with them Is that the jewelry comes off easily and they also comes out of the holes easily. I have found myself leaving home with jewelry on and to look down and they've either popped out or jewelry detached.
3.0,"Too thin and too long, but no ce"
3.0,"Comfortable, straps are very flimsy, no support but ideal for lounging around"
3.0,I wore this once under a vest and it worked but I wouldnt buy again
3.0,it's alright
3.0,Material isn't as soft as I thought it would be and as other onesies that I have bought online. I wish it was like the others especially since I paid around the same price or even less for the others but I guess it isn't terrible. Not a bad product.
3.0,"I ordered product because it said it was steel boned. Of course, it wasnt. Don't waste your money. False advertising. I will keep and wear because I don't feel like sending it back."
3.0,I am 5'9&#34; and 150 pounds. I ordered the size 10 in white. These are true to size and the quality is nice for the price. The pants are long enough for me. The crotch area is pretty baggy on me and the white is very see-through to the point where I have decided to return them.
3.0,"This bra is close to perfection. Nice look, great coverage. looks nice under form fitting shirt. However, In order to keep this price point low. The cup is pretty stiff. low quality foam, I suspect. Should they work out some bugs, I would love to try this bra again. I absolutely think their onto something great!  I kept it, and did some modifications. ( I sew)  I got my eye on this one . Not disappointed for the price"
3.0,The clips are not made very well and pop off a lot.  Had to tear a tiny hole in the top of the stockings for the clip to actually hold.
3.0,these are nice  but  a  pain to  put in.....
3.0,I like the Planet Waves gel shoulder strap pads I have on my guitars far far better than these ‚Äúair cells‚Äù.
3.0,Wore to wedding.
3.0,The shirt is cute but I did not like the fit of it. The arms were short. There was a wing like effect underarms where the shirt didn‚Äôt fit right. This shirt would be perfect for a petite person with short arms
3.0,I really like the dress. However I am 5'8&#34; and it isn't as long as I like them. Also the neckline goes way too high on my neck. Nothing like the pictures. :(
3.0,I have already written a review on these earrings.  The sprinkles did not show up like the picture.
3.0,I like these glasses. A lil more rounder frames than expected but stilll worth it.
3.0,I ordered it in a large adult and got a youth large and when I tried to reorder the jersey I can't find the adult large size again. It was meant for my husband but he can't fit into the jersey. I wish I could get this in a large adult because it's very comfortable. I can fit into a large youth (I'm normally extra small or small depending on the material) and I wish my husband could have one. Great buy for kids.
3.0,Liked the blanket but the head piece was to large and uncomfortable.
3.0,Pretty outfit - just runs smaller than suggested size chart.
3.0,"I ordered them for my boyfriend and found them to run small in the waist, even with the elastic. He wasn't comfortable as pajamas should have room for movement. The plaid pattern was nice but, I found the fabric stiff for flannel. Unfortunately, I had to return them."
3.0,"This fit me well (at 5'4"" and 140lb the medium was perfect in size), but it's going back.  The biggest reason is the material, it has an odd feeling to it.  I was expecting more of a cotton-y feel, but it's more synthetic feeling than that, even though the description says it's a cotton/spandex blend.  There is also no stretch aside from some elastic gathers on the sides, so I  think the description is wrong as far as materials go.  The zipper was also sticky, I had a hard time getting it up and down, and the dress wasn't tight on me, it just stuck a lot.<br /><br />It's really cute and flattering though, and the straps tie so you can adjust them, and the front ties are long enough to be tied together to turn it into a halter top, and tuck in or remove the back straps, so you can get a more custom fit without having to sew anything.  It hit me right above the knees, and I'm 5'4"" so be aware of that if you're taller and don't want a short dress.  The top was lined, but the bottom was not.  The fabric is thin, but doesn't look like it would be sheer, though I only wore it inside so I can't say for sure."
3.0,I ordered these for my son and they were listed as men's large. They look more like a woman's medium.
3.0,it was no really what i expected but is nice and flats your tummy. I&#34;m 140 pounds and order size m. One more size I think would be big
3.0,"Wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but it's ok"
3.0,Very cute and well made but a bit small.
3.0,"This is ok as a gift, This is not for me. The vale for the money was great."
3.0,While I loved the dress it the fit in my waist was too large...the dress looked baggy on me. Nice dress though...
3.0,"I purchased this watch band for the fitbit one after losing my fitbit one in a belt clip. Despite having the clip on as directed, it feel off during a run, leading to my great dissatisfaction. The band itself is of a better quality than most of the bands I have felt that are produced by fitbit (charge HR, blaze). It holds the one securely and I have no worries that is going to fall off. My one complaint, and why I give it three stars, is due to the inaccurate floors climbed tally of the fitbit one worn on the wrist. I great crazy floors climbed numbers (well over 50, when in a typical day I average around 20-30)"
3.0,Loved the style of these but they didn't fit my thighs despite following the instructions to order up
3.0,Soft lining but sized way too small
3.0,Pretty but bigger then expected
3.0,looks like a scrub top made from nicer material
3.0,The top is tight.
3.0,these shirts are cut very small
3.0,The bracelet is adjustable and sturdy. The earrings are metal but the plastic turquoise piece comes off so easily. Can probably hot glue it back on easily. The hair peice is also metal but oddly shaped. Doesn‚Äôt fit well against the head because it‚Äôs not rounded and actually curves outward at one end. Would still purchase again because it was for daughters birthday and she loved it.
3.0,Ok for slip on ... one was too small and another too big....medium wasn‚Äôt offered
3.0,"La tela no es la mejor, pero est√° bien para no m√°s de 5 lavadas."
3.0,Product fits but is snug...wanted it a little bit larger...description didn't specify whether it was in kids sizes or Adult.
3.0,Sadly I had to return these. My masks were too big and they didn‚Äôt stay in place.
3.0,It works with Legos!
3.0,clearly not expensive looking-but cute for everyday type wear
3.0,"Pretzels were just so-so and expensive. However, that being said it did offer a fun experience and diversion for the afternoon. We are going to try making pretzels again, but with a homemade recipe and not a mix. The box that held the mix was banged up and torn, as if it had been taken from a grocery stores discounted rack for damaged goods. (The inner contents were fine.)"
3.0,The fly in front isn't necessary and never used. But it causes the left leg to rise up/shift because the material isn't held in place as well on the side with the fly opening. Overall I like them but wish they didn't have a fly opening.
3.0,"I love this sweater, BUT now that I have washed it twice it is piling up and attracts everything! Unfortunately I wont be wearing it in public now, it looks nasty."
3.0,"I had higher hopes for this bracelet, but I will be returning it.  The elastic fit is too tight, using a string to measure it is about 6-3/4 inch around.  Another stretch pearl bracelet I ordered from the same company had a 7-1/2 inch measurement around, so a significant sizing difference.  The picture also is deceiving, I thought this was 4 strands wide and it is only 3, my error for viewing on a small screen but the picture could be better.  Not what I expected at all."
3.0,Sizing chart seemed to be off. These were too small. We returned them without ordering another size.
3.0,For the price they‚Äôre just ok.
3.0,beautiful but  I will have to get a battery for this as it is not working I hope a new battery works.
3.0,"I've only worn it a few times and already the golden plating has worn off.  But for the price point, it's adorable."
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and got a size large. The bottoms fit perfected (pant length hits the ground), top is way too big."
3.0,"Had to return because they were at least one, if not almost two sizes too small"
3.0,"I like it, thought the color is more light reds and dark pinks than bold red. It's rather short, and I can't find anything to lengthen it, so I haven't worn it. I still like how it looks and it feels heavy in the hand as it should, but with the color variations, I'm having a hard time matching it to my wardrobe."
3.0,The fit was just fine but I didn't like the style on myself so I returned it.
3.0,It's a cute piece but I didn't like the closure.
3.0,"Very Cute! I normally wear a size Large, but ordered up a size to an XL. It actually fits like a medium"
3.0,It's like you get what you pay for.
3.0,A bit lose.
3.0,"It is really cool, but I can't see out of the eye holes unless I cover basically my chin."
3.0,My husband stated that they were comfortable.
3.0,"I bought these for my husband, and they fit really well...until we washed them. The top shrunk at LEAST one size in the dryer. I‚Äôm pretty careful to follow tag instructions, so I was a little frustrated to discover this."
3.0,Nice Color but its plastic
3.0,Price was selling point. Size is a little small.
3.0,"I bought this in navy blue, but its so dark it almost looks black out of direct light. Still comfortable though"
3.0,"I like the watch but because of how small it is plus the size of the tiger in the dial, it‚Äôs hard to tell the time without squinting. Battery dead 30 days after purchase!"
3.0,Sizing is off.  It's supposed to be 2X but fits like a 1X!!!
3.0,"Falls out of ear. Need to wear a backing, but with threaded I shouldn't have to."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:40e7f772b8483a5501b2aaa7f5807a8a]] 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 127lbs, wearing size Medium. the dress is nice, but the quality is low grade. the stock photos looks very nice on the model, but the front gathers and seam is a little different on the dress i received; it doesn‚Äôt extend all the way to my right side. the sewing seam (that goes down my right side) just looks unproportioned/off-centered. the fabric is cheap (95% polyester) and the sewing isn‚Äôt the best. it looks like a nice dress made on a budget. the darker colors may not be see through, but the white color will show underwear (i‚Äôm wearing a nude thong in video/pics); you can see the label tag and the zipper tape through the white fabric. this is a dress i would buy from Ross for $12.99."
3.0,Hurt to put it and wouldn't even go all the way through. Maybe that's my fault for not getting the correct size though.
3.0,It's nice but I wish it was bigger (it's a normal size) and it came crooked also (one side sticks out a little) which bothers me some but I didn't want to wait for exchange. Other than that it looks exactly like the picture.
3.0,"So working as a Behavior Technician with children, it's best to dress professionally but comfortably. With that being said, I had planned on wearing this over leggings. I liked the fit, I liked the color, I liked the style of the top; but it was an odd feeling fabric and I tried it on and showed it to my husband (who is painfully honest), and he told me it pretty much looked like a church choir Halloween costume. And it felt like one. I must admit it would probably look much better in black but even then I don't care for the costume-y feeling fabric. I kinda felt like Jerry Seinfeld in the pirate shirt."
3.0,First order came broken but exchanged product and second was fine. Product as described.
3.0,I liked the fabric but the v-waist rolls down. They look nice but the fit is not great.
3.0,"They r decent quality etc but I got a women's large and they r snug. The feet r too snug and so is the length I'm 5'5"". I was expecting them to be roomy/baggy. I usually bwear a medium in clothes and PJs."
3.0,The quality of the jacket is very nice and beautiful but my only issue is where I had to return it was that the wrong size was sent so I would say order one size larger then the chart says
3.0,Very comfortable material however I'm 5'9&#34; and this hardly covered my butt.
3.0,Beautiful but flimsy.
3.0,"This is big on my 6' tall husband and big on me-- chest 38F, so it is definitely not a Medium in any sense if the word. It is like an XXL. But my daughter will not take it off. It's a little ridiculous looking, and the right size would have been nice, but she does really like it."
3.0,I was really excited for this as I love Rose Quartz.  The stone itself is really nice and pretty.  It was everything else I was not a huge fan of.  This looks really cheap.  It is more of something I would give my child than for myself.  The chain and design were cheap feeling and looking and not something that blew me away.
3.0,Quite a bit short. Very cute. Nice material. Well made. Very snug but stretchy. Grav one that is 1-2 sizes bigger.
3.0,It is really just but the arm holes are huge and it‚Äôs boxy. I wish I would of known and I would of sizes down 2 sizes
3.0,"These definitely ran small, and I don't really understand how they base their sizing at all. I read reviews saying they ran small, so I ordered up in size. I ordered &#34;size 10,&#34; what I received says size 32 on the tag. I typically wear a 28-30 in waist size, just depending on the pants, so for all intents and purposes, these shorts should be a little big on me, except they're a bit snug. Even in the Q&A section here on Amazon, the seller says size 10 is 33. I can still wear them, and I'm sure I'll drop a bit more weight just from being active in the summer anyways. Just buyer beware.<br /><br />Also, just now reading even more reviews on these, it seems like a gamble on whether you get something too big or too small. IDK good luck ordering? Just guess and see what you get üòÇ<br /><br />I give three stars just because choosing a size is so confusing to buyers.<br /><br />They are super cute though."
3.0,Product came in with small hole in waist band.
3.0,"Top is a litttttle small and the padding is a weird shape, just a circle but for the price it isn't bad."
3.0,Fragile but nice
3.0,As soon as I opened it and tried to open the clasp to put it on the clasp broke
3.0,"it's comfy but material feels cheap, it never stays on my hips right because at the waist it has to elastic to keep it up. I always have to pull them up and when they do fall its after walking about 15 ft."
3.0,El tama√±o de la blusa no es fiel a la talla
3.0,Bottoms a bit saggy
3.0,"Very light glasses that are reasonably comfortable for what they are.  I actually bought them to wear for working around the house because I have bad seasonal allergies.  They help keep stuff out of my eyes, but they do fog up some, that's why I only gave them 3 stars.  I also like that they come with arms and an interchangeable strap."
3.0,"Came quickly, beautiful dress, but it didn't fit me in tummy and back. Not good for apple shapes."
3.0,it fits nice. I am saving for winter as it looks pretty Christmasy in real life.
3.0,Material not breathable.
3.0,"Terrible quality, hate the material"
3.0,Bought this for a friend. She says it's &#34;super cute&#34; but starts to hurt her ear after a few hours wearing it. It's worth the pain though.
3.0,"The fit is different than what‚Äôs shown on the model. Too big, too long and meh, not for me."
3.0,Ripped 1st x I washed them
3.0,"I like the hat, however I have very short hair and a small head, this cap is large and there was no choice in s,m,l cause I would have chosen a smaller size."
3.0,visor too flexible causing distorted vision.
3.0,"it was a nice suit, nothing really wrong with it, however it fit quite small, wife returned it."
3.0,"Overall this dress is just okay - the fabric is inexpensive looking and thin, the hems and seams aren‚Äôt as clean looking as they could be, and a slip or nude undergarments would have to be worn. Some nice touches on this piece include real working buttons and pockets.  I haven‚Äôt washed the garment yet but am prepared for it to get a bit shorter in length - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 wearing a M.  I probably would not wear it as a dress even at this length for my own comfort BUT it could be by someone who doesn‚Äôt mind the length.  I do plan on wearing this with skinny jeans, leggings or maybe even shorts if I can find the right length.  I typically wear a M on top but this still has that oversized look that I was hoping for.  My final thought - this product is a decent purchase for the price and makes for an inexpensive top/dress to add to your closet!"
3.0,"ehhh... Im so used the to in this world plus sizes to run smaller. But no, this coat runs really big. I'm 5'5 and 247 lbs so I got the 3x as I'm usually 2ish/3x in pants. But no a 3x in this jacket is made for someone 350 lbs. It's also very thin for a winter coat, I'd call it more of a jacket then true bubble coat. I'm not exchanging it for the smaller size because I'm planning a baby with hubby and would rather have room to grow if needed with this cheap coat. But jus know that you get what you pay for. I knew it too. No winter coat worth it is under a hundred and 50 bucks in all honesty"
3.0,This was given as a gift and the recipient was very appreciative.  The problem is only that I bought that product before at a much lower price and have found it on EBay for half the price.
3.0,The material sucks but it fit as expected. I had an issue with the top & the strings.
3.0,"Cant open this purse still, purse  has scratches . Though beautiful and true  description  . Am returning."
3.0,their was a red hair tangled in the rope. I got it out so its alright I guess. Also the beads color fades if you don't take the necklace off before going into water.
3.0,"Cute mermaid shorts, BUT there is NO rainbow shine. It‚Äôs a flat, one color shine. I ordered the silver & thought it would have a rainbow glitter look exactly like the photo, but nope. I actually thought maybe I was sent the wrong color, but when I checked the options again, I realized the pictures just don‚Äôt represent the actual shorts. Pretty disappointed. They‚Äôre slightly see-thru, too; the fabric is thin. I just really wanted the rainbow sheen shorts like in the picture. Oh well"
3.0,It was for Halloween... Made it work.
3.0,"The gauge is a little thick for my liking, and the hoop was a bit big. Definitely helped me decide that I do want my nose pierced though!!"
3.0,Stitching already hanging all out cheaply made
3.0,i was so happy to get them when i saw that that the necklace was so pretty! and it fit me so well but one of the pairs of earings did come broken i think it was how it was made or how badly it was package but it was pretty!
3.0,Not sturdy at all. My dog is 5 lbs and it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt hold her. It‚Äôs very big for her body as well.
3.0,The top is ok and I will be keeping it. I will not buy another due to the way the it lays at the back on my neck. It sags and flips over showing the tag. Otherwise I do like it but the neck is all wrong.
3.0,If you purchase this please go up one size. I wears medium so that is what I ordered and then washed them and got small so order one size up.
3.0,"This was our first experience with this brand. The waist of the jeans is labeled as a 32, and this sizing is/was correct. You could probably be a 33 waist and still find these comfortable.  The legs of these jeans are definitely skinny.  On a 14 year-old, 6', 170# boy they were almost too tight even though his legs aren't overly muscular or even on the big side. The fabric is stretchy, but skin-tight is the best way to describe how the legs of these jeans fit. He even had a hard time getting his size 12 foot through the legs and the opening at the cuffs. Anyone not a fan of skinny jeans will want to skip these, but anyone who loves a pair of painted on skinny jeans should give these a try. Though advertised as men's jeans, these might be better suited for girls/women. His older sister tried these on, and they fit her much better. Her legs are very willowy compared to her brother's build so she didn't have any complaints about the legs feeling too tight. The waist was a bit big, though a belt fixed that and a tunic top worn along with these jeans made for a cute outfit.<br /><br />The jeans are well-made without any funky seams, loose threads, or a bad zipper.  When washed there is some dye release (so use a color-catching sheet), but no shrinkage or significant wear to the fabric. They've held up well to be worn at least once a week for several months (by my niece who claimed the pair as her own since they don't fit her brother).  I'd have to say these are more jeggings than skinny jeans, though."
3.0,"I like it a lot, but I'm going to have to adjust the elastic at the wrists.  For as big as it is, the nexk and shoulders could be slightly bigger.  I can easily fix that myself."
3.0,Too clingy for me.
3.0,"Nice bracelets, however, the black ones have a lot smaller than the rest. They are also made with a string that has very little elasticity. As soon as my dad put them on, one of the black ones snapped. They are very nice looking though."
3.0,Shirt is cute but did not look as cute in person as it did in the picture. Also was not long enough.  I am 5'7&#34; and I felt like I had to keep pulling the shirt down.
3.0,"Okay so this is probably one of the most novelty purchases I've made. It does slap onto your wrist, steering wheel, and in my case stroller handle. But then unrolling it is dumb or maybe I just don't know how to unroll the sides quickly. Still is durable and that's what I need at the moment."
3.0,Snug fitting. Would order another size larger if I would order again.
3.0,"Fabric is very thick I would definitely not wear it in the summer. However, the quality is good and the buttons are unique and adorable."
3.0,"I have hips.  I'm 5'9"" and 145ibs most of my weight is in my hips.  I should have gone with a large instead of my usual medium.  They will work for now.  I just have to wear a baggy shirt over them."
3.0,My boyfriend loved this shirt however the print is starting to come off after 3 washings.  Too late to return it.
3.0,Dress is very see through which is uncomfortable to me.
3.0,Cute but the fall off when doing any workout. Maybe not for yoga. Wouldn't recommend
3.0,This is cute. My issue is it is a tight fit. Then after using it for about two weeks a screw fell out. If not for parts from another one I would have been out of luck. So much potential but I was left disappointed.
3.0,Made more for a man!!
3.0,It was good I liked it but I like oversized stuff so I don‚Äôt like it that muchüòï
3.0,I was a bit disappointed that the interior didn't have some type of finished lining but otherwise the robe is ok. For the price I paid it's as expected.
3.0,"I am a size 34 A, size 00/0 pants (24/25), and small in clothes. This bottoms fit great just have to tighten the bows on the sides a bit and the top was a bit too big. It covers and fits well but on the back the strings are way too long."
3.0,"When I received the t-shirt, the smell from the print was so strong I had to wash it before giving it to my grandson. After washing it, it lost its shape. I was a little disappointed. But he loved the shirt."
3.0,They are ok. I‚Äôve only worn them for less than 5 months and they are already falling apart though. I only wear them inside at work. So quality isn‚Äôt great.
3.0,"Dress should come with  instructions.. cute little wrap around dress, does not cover boobs and definitely wear something underneath"
3.0,"Cheap looking, quality isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs inexpensive so it balances out. I got this for a sister in law I don‚Äôt really like lol"
3.0,Shirt ran at least one size too small. Great quality material.
3.0,This chain of beads is made from very weak metal and breaks easily.
3.0,I bought a large. I did not have to try it on to know it wouldn't fit. I would say the girl in the pic is wearing the large! Unless these are for teens.
3.0,"Ordered a Large, shirt is LARGE.  I am 5' 10&quot; 185 it fits larger than most other large shirts,  I should've ordered a medium for a little better fit.  Not retuning, because it's just a little more loose than I like.  I don't like tight fits."
3.0,"Will return this b/c the pattern is not even close to the one I ordered.  It looks gaudy.<br />Very well made and fully lined.  Adjustable straps.  Comfortable fabric.<br />Just not as pictured.  The colors that stand out are red and aqua, with  more yellow than gold."
3.0,It is tight around the ribs which is hard since I have fibromyalgia. It is very loose in the breasts...no real support but if you have breast pain it will not bind the breast. No support since it is extremely streatchy. I am a 38/DDD or H. Bought a Large.
3.0,Tight and shorter than expected
3.0,"The opening zipper is too small.  One compartment goes all the way around in a circle.  So if stuff ends up on the back side (the side opposite the zipper opening), it's annoying to shift it all the way around to the front.  The zipper opening is narrow, making it hard to get things out.  The material had little rigidity, so it tends to scrunch up - which makes it hard to get stuff out or out stuff in.<br /><br />It's usable, but it's not great.  There are defi itelt better ones."
3.0,it is ok. not good though
3.0,This is a beautiful blouse and gorgeous color but it was a little small.  That was the only drawback.
3.0,Magnet is not as strong as the basic Click readers.<br /><br />The adjustment area is very limited compared to the basic Click readers.<br /><br />Durability is questionable.<br /><br />Bifocal and polarized lenses are good.<br /><br />Cost is too high for the product at around $100!<br /><br />Overall product needs some refinements.
3.0,Good easy to wear dress. Hem was coming undone when received.
3.0,"Nice quality and color appears the same as the photo.  It's a little too stretchy for me though.  If I knew it would be elastic as much as it is, I would have probably ordered one size smaller."
3.0,Pay attention to the reading. I thought I did until I went back a re read after ordering. You will only get 1 plug. Not 1 pair. Just 1 for one ear so you have to make sure your ordering two. Other than that issue they are cute I do wear them even though it says for stretching.
3.0,"The fabric was very itchy in the midriff area and rides up so the waist is not in the correct are.  Is really cute, but if you are busty, or have sensitive skin, this may not be the dress for you.  Have to admit I have only worn it once because of this."
3.0,The material is really nice and the colors are beautiful but the shirt does not hang off your shoulders as shown in the pictures. I‚Äôm going to have to make some alterations to the shirt to achieve that look.
3.0,Looks cute but didnt fit well at all. Sadly it has to go back
3.0,Fabric a little thin and the \S/ already cracked and I can‚Äôt iron the shirt with it wrinklies or I‚Äôll obviously make the \S/ a mess. But was good for some photos for the price
3.0,Ir's okay the only thing  i hate about it is that it look more like a night dress.
3.0,"Seriously, this thing squishes my toes up. Soft, bu a somewhat masochistic wear.<br /><br />Size 10F foot medium width."
3.0,I really love the set up of this piece.  Unfortunately the back cuts into my lip even though the piece is long enough.  Maybe if the back flat it wouldn't be a problem. üòû
3.0,This sweater is very nice and soft.  My only problem is it runs very small!
3.0,Love the width but super long. I have small wrists so I wear it on the 5th tightest hole but that leaves a lot of band to tuck in
3.0,Bought this thinking it would fit my bible but it didn't. Love the look of it but I just wish it fit. I purposely bought this one because it was slightly larger than the dimensions of my bible  which are 10 x 7.3 x 2 but to my surprise it didn't fit.
3.0,I purchased this item for my sister-in-law. Item appears as shown in the ad and pictures. The other charms on the bracelet appear cheap and unattractive.  I ended up removing the item form the bracelet and hanging from chain instead. This option should be made available too.
3.0,"It was cute for the price. My daughter liked it. It didn't last long, charms started to fall off and it tarnished."
3.0,"Received on time,  now beautiful in person.<br />But it was shipped poorly, in a plastic bag.<br />The posts were bent when I received it,  and the plastic back was broken. Should've been shipped in a box."
3.0,Great gloves. Soft and neutral. Touchscreen does not work.
3.0,It's too thin.
3.0,"The seams started breaking after first wash. They‚Äôre fine in terms of material, but quality of sewing is poor. I‚Äôve had to sew back up 3 of the 6 in about a month‚Äôs time."
3.0,I like the dress over all but had to take it to a seamstress to get it fix from torso it was to big from top part of dress.
3.0,"These pants are too small.  I'm 5-8, 200 lbs.  They are ok, but the bum is too tight ( I know, I know, I'm working on it).  I decided to keep them, because I'll be able to fit in them pretty soon, right?  I do love the wide band at the waist.  I'm hoping to love them when they fit!"
3.0,"Wanted to love this sweatshirt but it is not true to the photos. I understand that screens make colors differ, but this isn‚Äôt even close. The photo shows a soft baby pink sweatshirt and what I received was a peach/salmon colored sweatshirt. It‚Äôs so different that the pink of the design clashes with the shirt it‚Äôs printed on. Major bummer. It also smelled very strongly of ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù. The odor came out in the wash but was still off putting when I opened the package. All in all I‚Äôm somewhat disappointed and won‚Äôt be ordering again."
3.0,"Very disappointed in the color. . .it's not khaki; more like a weird pale lavender. The fit is okay, a little tighter around the arms for comfort. Very pretty back though. Probably give away or put in a consignment shop. Also very wrinkled. It's made well but I don't know how it will wear given the wrinkles."
3.0,"Wash before you wear! Great basic a little scratchy, but wash and softener and no more scratching."
3.0,I ordered green like the color. Short in the arms I‚Äôm normal med size got some meat. I ordered by the chart . Go for a size larger.
3.0,I bought a L and XL because the reviews were mixed. The tags read Large and X-Large but they were the exact same size and measurements. The arms were extremely tight. I had to cut some of the elastic out for them to fit properly. Recommend going a few sizes up.
3.0,"I bought this for my fiancee as a gift.  Initially we thought it was great and quite striking to look at, but then we noticed the minute hand was broken (loosely hanging.)<br /><br />It's a shame since the watch looks so unique, but the quality just doesn't seem to be there...we will be returning it."
3.0,"I was very excited to wear these pants, and they were comfy when I tried them on!<br />However, after washing them in cold water, I noticed that the pants looked worn out already. There‚Äôs a fuzz appearance that won‚Äôt go away with a lint roller, and it looks unkempt. So I only wear these pants at home now.<br />BUT I will say, they are perfectly wearable as pants and I‚Äôve washed them 5+ times now and they don‚Äôt look much worse than they did after the first wash. The fabric is thick so it keeps me warm in cold weather, and I still think the rainbow stripe is cute. I‚Äôd guess the pants will last for at least year of consistent wearing.<br />Also, as far as size goes, these pants have a tight fit. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre tighter than most my drawstring pants, though the waistband can stretch. I like wearing high waisted pants, so I‚Äôm happy that it fits comfortably around my waist. I usually wear a size 32 for pants I wear at hip level, and my waist is 26‚Äù."
3.0,The size runs very small. The material in the front is very shiny and looks cheap. the dress is worth $30  but it also looks cheap. I am returning because of the size and quality.
3.0,"These are great sandels. Fit well and are comfortable. Only compliant is that after about a year of wear, the straps become a bit loose."
3.0,"The quality and color of this shirt was very nice.  However, I had to return because it was really small across the chest and arms.  It is a stretchy fabric but I knew the minute it came out of the package it would be too small.  I normally wear a large and this looked to be the size of a normal medium."
3.0,I got a large and it fit really small. 5'7 160 pounds :(
3.0,I've bought several of these hats over the years. This one is the same as others I've gotten but ran much much smaller. For that reason i took off two stars. The 2-4T fits like a 12-18m
3.0,The small gems are very poorly connected to the big center one. I now have a piece of 3 stones instead of 5. But I'm wearing it anyway.
3.0,"Not the best product on the market. The size adjuster will not stay in place on its own. It can slip of even while wearing the ring. Works okay if you have some really thin two-sided tape, such as hem tape, to line the adjuster and keep it in place on the ring. If you do not want to make this slight modification, there are other alternative products on the market that may better suit your needs."
3.0,"It's a little small, but perfect for tampons."
3.0,It‚Äôs a cute night shirt. Soft and comfortable but it stays wrinkled. Which is absolutely annoying
3.0,"The back view of the jumper is somewhat too flat, no any design"
3.0,"Be warned - the three small dials within the watch face do not have any function, and do not work, despite the push buttons on the sides of the stem. Of course, the description does not say these dials actually work, or what their functions are, but one might fairly assume that if there are extra dials, that they might actually do something. NOT. This is strictly a &#34;costume&#34; watch, but then what might one expect for $7. I do not regret this purchase - just for fun and giggles. However, this is NOT &#34; high quality&#34; as stated in the ad copy."
3.0,Look comfortable but are a whole size smaller than tag says.
3.0,I had to fix it in order to wear it.
3.0,It is very pretty but it was a lot smaller than I expected.
3.0,"Oversized is an understatement. Personally they swallowed up my face so I returned them but they did offer good protection from the sun. They are so big, no sunshine is gets in around them."
3.0,"Expectations weren't super high with this one but immediately upon taking the product out of the envelope it came in, one of the buttons came off. I still need to sew it on before I wear it because it was the very top button and is visible when worn with a sweater. It also seems a little large for me (usually a small or medium in shirts) but it was $7 so I'm not expecting luxury."
3.0,"too small, low cut and slit was to high.  Dress was very itchy and uncomfortable.  Dress itself was pretty to look at."
3.0,I got this for my daughter and its not quite what I expected. Its not a cloth material and the smell of rubber/plastic is overwhelming. The neck part hangs a little low and is non adjustable.
3.0,very long and thicker fabric
3.0,Its a nice mask but after i washed them the other one shrink and can only use one now.
3.0,Ordered these for a Christmas gift for my husband who likes to ice fish and ride his snowmobile. First day he wore them the seam rippped open at the ring finger. Had to send them back but the quality of the mitten portion seemed very well made. He hated to send them back. We just didn‚Äôt trust that it wouldn‚Äôt happen to another pair if we ordered a replacement.
3.0,"I wear these non-stop- sleep, shower... unfortunately the post bent a little. my other silver earrings have never had that happen to them. otherwise, really pretty"
3.0,Very nice but clasps are not consistent.
3.0,la caja llego totalmente reventada
3.0,"This top is more like a pajama top, not really a sweatshirt. Super soft, but probably won‚Äôt wear it out of the house. The pockets are small and if you want the look on the model order a size up. I ordered my size and it‚Äôs not big like on the picture. It‚Äôs long, but not big."
3.0,"I read some of the reviews about the color of the stones not like the color in the picture, and I have to agree. They are barely bluie, more like crystal. I bought them for my sister's birthday and decided to just keep them because they weren't what I was hoping for, wanting to give her something really nice instead of just ok."
3.0,Smaller than expected some do not open nor close correctly
3.0,cute bracelet but it has a strange odor??? hope the odor goes away!
3.0,It's a beautiful dress. I would recommend 2 sizes larger though. The bust area is cut entirely too small.
3.0,It is not exactly what I wanted. But is an OK Yoga pants.
3.0,This is a really fun concept and design.  I wish it was more consistent with its performance.  I had one work and one that did not.  They are fun to play with but can have some scratchy parts at the connections.
3.0,"I am 5'3 and 145 lbs, i got a medium and it fits great, but i dont like the cut on it. I feel like it does not flatter my shape."
3.0,"There are no natural fibers in this material to allow the fabric to breathe.  If you get hot easily, these are not for you."
3.0,Size runs very small. I am a true size 12-14 so ordered size Large but this dress was far too small to wear.  It is made of a nice stretch fabric but very form fitting (tight) fit. Not sure a size XL would be large enough.
3.0,"The small ones are impossible to get in - they are so small that they don‚Äôt even reach the piercing, but the larger ones fit fine."
3.0,"Cute, buy one of the clear nose pieces was missing upon receiving it."
3.0,I had to return these sunglasses because they came damaged.  The nose piece was missing the camouflage (it was white) on one side and one lens was scratched.  Gave 3 stars because it was very easy to return.
3.0,When I  first looked at this dress I thought it would be a nice long dress but it turned out to be very short. It will still work as a  cute top of leggings but it deafly cannot be worn as a dress on its own. The fabric doesn't seam to match the image either. It is a lot more see through then I was expecting so I will definitely have to wear leggings with it. Other wise it is a nice top and I will definitely wear it but it just isn't like the image.
3.0,It‚Äôs an ok dress
3.0,"This is supposed to be a mans jacket but it zips on a ladies side. Other than that, fits good and is comfortable"
3.0,"It fits, just not like I thought it would. I would size up if you want it to look like the model."
3.0,Look too fake .I recieved one stone is missing. Poor quality but nice design simple and elegant.
3.0,"Love the shoes. The design is exactly as pictured online. They are super comfy with the fabric tops and rubber soles. However, the length of the shoes runs extremely small. We had to exchange for 2 sizes larger. With that said, the heal of the shoe is a little wide. I think it is just the way they are designed. The adult shoes by the same company fit the same way."
3.0,"This is a really cute dress style, the quality of the fabric seems good, but I couldn't tell from the picture how orangey this ""red"" dress actually was.  Orange is not flattering on me at all, so I am returning it.  I usually wear a small or 4 in dresses, so I ordered a small - the arms on this dress were really tight, and one was tighter than the other (to my knowledge my arms are about the same size lol) - so a bit of a quality control issue there.  The bodice of the dress and skirt seemed true to size.  If I were to order again, I would order in black and go with a medium to see if the arms are any better fitting."
3.0,My daughter was happy with  &#34;  the swim suit
3.0,Was expecting more ‚ÄúCotten‚Äù. This material has almost a ‚Äúsatin‚Äù feel to it.
3.0,"The color (red-violet) is not as pictured. It's a strange and hideous color that matches with nothing. But the capris fit fine, and they were comfortable. I just couldn't get past the color!"
3.0,These looked too much like old man jeans and had a little snag on the front.  The Amazon branded jeans although only in 28 length fit much better and we're half the price.
3.0,"This item arrived to me broken, so I returned it. Otherwise, I liked the bunny and the chain. It does not look like real gold. More of a yellowish orange color. So, I probably would have still returned.... Why is it so hard to find a good bunny chain..?"
3.0,Smaller than what the sizing guide says. But it is a very cute jacket. Note...jacket. Definatly not thick enough for a coat. And is not lined.
3.0,It worked for a last minute funeral I attended but nothing I‚Äôd purchase again üòû
3.0,Really liked the shirt wish it fit :(. Way too small. I usually wear XL and this XL dis not fit.
3.0,the hoops are too small for my ears i should have read the diameter size better
3.0,"This wallet is very cute.  The problem I have with it is the snap.  Once you put your cards in it, it's hard to snap.  I bought a new wallet after about a month."
3.0,"Love the color, love the style! They are a little to narrow and have not stretched out after every day wear. I wear them, but only for a few hours at a time."
3.0,Couldn‚Äôt get it over my hips/butt so I can‚Äôt give an honest opinion
3.0,"It was way way too short. Barely covered my daughter, she had to return it. It fit fine everywhere else, just the length was crazy short for her."
3.0,Color was exactly as shown. Nice fit.<br />The packaging could have been better.<br />It was sorta balled up. Not professionally wrapped. Have to iron or take to cleaners
3.0,"needed a black surgical cap however, I'm not impressed with this one."
3.0,"Had to return as I ordered the XL based on the reviews.  It does not run small, it's true to sizing.  I would have exchanged for the L but I didn't love it enough.  Had a weird shape in the cups and can't adjust neck straps."
3.0,The bottoms are quite skimpy with butt cheeks hanging out all over the place!
3.0,"It runs a little small and the package says no machine wash and made in China, which has me a little skeptical. I'll update this review in a few weeks and upload pictures, too."
3.0,"Ties are fine. Good quality for the price, but they are pretty short."
3.0,"Like the style and fit. Tint is too dark. Lens popped out a few times, but easily snaps back in. Not bad for the price"
3.0,"It is a lot more white than shown in the picture, and ran large for me."
3.0,Thought the chain would be heavier. A bit on the cheap side but loved the style. Plus it was s gift from the grandkids and of course ‚ÄúNana‚Äù loved it.
3.0,I followed the fitting instructions which stated this top ran small (I bought it just for the top).  I usually wear a medium so I ordered a large.  I should have ordered the medium as the one I received did not even fit around my ribs.
3.0,My daughter is a huge Dr. WHO FAN and any dr who fan knows you have to have a fez. This was a great price and looked great in the pictures. When I recieved it I was very disappointed. The hat was folded in half with large creases down both sides. The  is a nice color and seems to be well made but the creases in the sided will not come out and makes it look misshapen on my head. I am not happy with this purchace.
3.0,I would rather in other kind of material. It's look really fake
3.0,"Very cute top but the medium was more like a small, gave it to my 12 year old granddaughter. I was planning on wearing it to Disney"
3.0,"Great hat, but too small even in x-large."
3.0,"Exactly as pictured and fit well. But There is a sort of sticky elastic inside the tights, meant to hold them in place, but it seemed to just roll up instead."
3.0,Fits great just not beige colored like I ordered.  Looks more like pale yellow.
3.0,Not cut very well.
3.0,SHOPPING WAS SOMEHOW VERY LONG
3.0,Bought similar dresses..and this one ran small.
3.0,"They were difficult to hook, once they are however, I think they will never be lost. A bit smaller than anticipated, but definitely wide hoops.  Will keep them!  Thanks, B"
3.0,THE BRACELLET NOT VERY RESISTENT.
3.0,mostly plastic. but it looks nice and does what its suppose to.
3.0,The sizing one these are huge and not true to size. I think they‚Äôll serve their purpose... once they fit.
3.0,I bought this and the identical product from JewelrieShop. This one came in a black velour pouch (as seen in photos) but also had more defective nose bones including one with no stone at all. There are more crooked jewels in this package also. That could just be happenstance but could be consistent. I thought it could help somebody make a choice between the two.<br />Edit: I took the packaging into better light and found that one two or three of almost every color was so crooked they were unwearable. The last picture is of all that remain. Just order from JewelrieShop. I didn't even throw out one of those.
3.0,I like them overall. The fabric at the ankle came very loose
3.0,a bit tight across bust
3.0,Thought this was solid but it was mesh. Must have overlooked that part. I ordered an XL and it was too loose in the waist and to long for my liking. Will seek elsewhere. It also looks and feels cheap.
3.0,I brought this for my daughter it does not come with the white drawstrings. They was rainbow. Will never buy from this shop again.
3.0,"It is a very lovely dress.  However, I was not sure how it would lay on me.  The top was cut a little weird but it was wearable.  It just did not sit comfortably on my chest, shoulders, and arms.  I wore it to the event I bought it for and after a while didn't notice the tightness.  I am a little top heavy and maybe that was why it just did not sit correctly.  But I got a lot of compliments through out the night."
3.0,"Color is BRIGHT green, not a deeper emerald color. Would be lovely for costume party, not so great for wedding guest outfit. Comfortable fit - has zipper on the side so it's not a true wrap dress. I'm 5'9"" and 170 and the large fit great."
3.0,"I love the material I love how soft and warm it is, but the pocket is ridiculous! For 1 my hand doesn't even fit inside the pocket and 2 my phone doesn't fit which was what I wanted it for when I have a sweater and no pockets I can carry in my scarf. It sucks big time!"
3.0,Short in length ( I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù ). Great color. Comfy.
3.0,These are cute. A bit on the plastic side but for the price I liked them. The metal is nice but the &#34;leather&#34; is like plastic. If you are looking for leather look else wear.  From a distance you can't tell.
3.0,It's shorter than it look in the picture.
3.0,not remain satisfied with the product size
3.0,"These are more of a novelty item than a useful item. I like to wear them on patriotic holidays, but they aren't great for everyday use. They are VERY dark, to the point that you almost can't see out of them. They look awesome though!"
3.0,"These look cute more than they actually hold hair in place. If you're going for a cute headband look they're great with a ponytail at the gym. wouldn't use them for any actual sporting activities. They are cheaper material than the Goody stuff that looks the same. I bought them for the look, so I didn't care that much."
3.0,They are not bad. Polarization is not the greatest.
3.0,As pictured and ok for price paid.
3.0,I love Coach...This watch in particular.But over time the wristband became dull and dirty.Now maybe I shouldn‚Äôt hv used it everyday but I don‚Äôt buy things to put them in a drawer.Ive had 2 Coach purses that the zipper has broken and a pair of glasses that just completely broke just being in my purse.I would by this watch again bc I love the little charm.And the initial color.Just wouldn‚Äôt use it as a everyday watch.
3.0,"I really liked the pattern on this top. My biggest comaplaints are that it fits funny. Its very boxy even with the elastic on the sides, and its short. Overall it just looks the best while being worn under a scrub jacket."
3.0,"Their cute but a little short, so not full coverage for my bottom. I ordered a medium"
3.0,"I really like it ^__^ Im 5‚Äô5‚Äù 170lb and ordered M.<br />I would have rather it be more loose so I should have gotten a L, believe it or not I use to be a small in everything and I‚Äôve gained some weight so buying in bigger sizes is still some getting use to lol Cute buy ü§òüèº‚ò∫Ô∏èüñ§"
3.0,Not liking the shine look yonit and after one wash it has little all over it
3.0,"Works really well but doesn't fit me at all so I need one hand to hold them up or they just fall off my face. Partially because they're really big and partially because they're really heavy. And they look GREAT :p (sarcasm.) But, I have multiple spinal fusions and can't bend my neck without straining disks, so it's a pretty good solution when I need to 'look down.'"
3.0,"Very pretty and lightweight but doesn't grab the entire back of ear so you must &#34;pinch&#34; it to a small area of ear which hurts after a while. Cannot sleep, shower, or swim with it as I do with the one I currently wear. This is definitely a temporary wear."
3.0,They are very see-through and now that i know i don't wear them.
3.0,"Pretty and fun but one of the 'crystals' has already fallen off, I will have to reglue it.  Would not repurchase."
3.0,Kinda cheap looking when you get up close. The gem looks like it might fall out randomly
3.0,"Waiting. I don not receiver in my house, but it still em my box in US. I hope enjoy some time."
3.0,I love the sound of this chime. Unfortunately the silver has all worn off.  After 34 weeks of daily wear the pendant is aged brass looking.
3.0,"Wanted to get a military jacket for a while now, ended up getting this, but I should be got a size smaller; I also had to remove the patches cause one was a U.S. Army Special Forces patch, another was a U.S. Army Airborne tab and one resembled Master Jump wings."
3.0,"I purchased the Lacey Opal Septum Ring in Purple and as soon as I got it I was in love. This ring is absolutely gorgeous! I received compliments everywhere I went. It wasn't too large in size and fit nicely in my piercing and was proportionate for my face. One of the best things about this ring is it stays put. It was rather difficult to remove, but for me that is a definite plus. I find too often clickers become undone very easily and the hinge mechanism wears out within the first couple of months. That is not the case with this ring.<br /><br />I am giving this ring 3 stars because while this ring is SUPER cute and stays in place so well, the opal in my ring fell out after a week of wearing it. Which is very frustrating and may speak to a bad individual ring or a design flaw, I cannot say either way."
3.0,The fabric on this is super cheap feeling.  I would not order again.
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend less than two weeks ago and the paint has already started to chip. It's cute, but not durable."
3.0,Fair product
3.0,The dress is way shorter than how it appears.
3.0,Thought I was buying a better quality.
3.0,I was attempting to buy a pair without compression. The amazon discription didn't say it did so I purchased them by mistake. They did have compression. However a friend was able to use them.<br />Do you have them in white without compression?
3.0,"1 of the 4 pairs is not sized correctly. 2 different sizes combined in the pair. Don't think my toddler can wear it, unfortunately"
3.0,Lasted 2 weeks plastic loop cracked. Other than That loved it.
3.0,Exrtemely small.  Sized for a child.
3.0,Slip stopped right under my behind
3.0,"I bet it was warm, I felt there is not enough support for the feet. I returned it."
3.0,Power is right. Some reading glasses are thicker than others making them a little heavier. These are pretty thick.
3.0,"Runs large! If you were a woman above 5'10"" skirt would be lower thigh or at knee in a size small. I am shorter than average at 4'11"". Bust 38"", waist 33"", hip 41"". Usually size US10/12 dress size or 14/16+ if it is not typical US sizing. I ordered a SMALL (based on reviews of running big) & I needed a belt to hold it up which it had no loops for & no smaller size offered. Yes I am on the short side but with my behind & hips I typically order LARGE sometimes Medium if it has stretch around the hips & waist. The small was below my knees. It had good stretch for the waist (not that it was even needed) but the length was even longer than expected. Can see it being comfortable & maybe flattering but only if you are above 5'5"" with a waist bigger than 32""."
3.0,Very pretty but pills on to other clothing and snags easily. Would not buy again.  Also would read the reviews more carefully
3.0,"I really want to like this top.  I love the colors/pattern and the flowy sleeves.  Although I have this in my normal size large, the fit is very different on me than the model.  It is tight - to the point where it gapes at the buttons at the bust.  It is also much shorter than pictured."
3.0,"I'm disappointed! According to the size chart I was to order a xlg for my dad, I bought him 2 shirts, but they were huge on him! I would have to pay $19.00 to return them! Not happy I can't exchange for correct size."
3.0,they look nice but broke within 4 days of use
3.0,Not a proper fit
3.0,"The quality of the pajamas was great however I usually wear size medium and ordered a large based on the reviews. Even a large was too small, item returned,"
3.0,It was weird. One pair was absolutely perfect. The other pair was a bit small.  They were obviously a different brand as it had no tag or any markings inside indicating front or back like the good fitting pair did. A little bummed.
3.0,Love this bracelet but it broke almost immediately.  I still wear it with a safety pin holding it together...
3.0,The dress fits but wasn't long enough. I'm 5'8.5 and it didn't touch the floor as I thought/read it would.
3.0,"So cute! This was a gift for my daughter, and she loved it! She's a size small, so it fits her, but it wouldn't fit me. One size doesn't fit all."
3.0,"I totally missed that the dress is a large tube with no form at all.  I could do nothing to make the dress look flattering on me.  I do think it might have worked better if my belt had a contrasting design like the picture on the website, but my belt just blended in.  Also the dress fell shorter on me than in the model so it just didn't look right.  However, the pattern is so pretty and the fabric feels nice and silky.  I've repurposed it into a lovely skirt and actually really like it.  But definitely recommend checking sizing and dimensions before purchasing.  Also note it bled like crazy when I hand washed."
3.0,it seems like good quality but it came in twice the size i thought it would.  Either order true to size or order down to a small/ med.  I am 5 1 about 130 pounds.
3.0,"I loved everything about it except that it came with a stain on the front! Normally I'm a size M/L. I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly. It's soft and comfortable. HOWEVER, when it arrived I noticed a lighter colored stain in the front. I thought maybe it got dirty while shipping or something.  I'm not due for another month so I didn't wash it right away. Well I just washed it and the spot is definitely a stain. And one of the buttons is already coming off. I haven't even worn it yet! The picture doesn't do the stain justice, It's noticeable. So I'm very sad that I paid twenty some dollars for this and is defective. Boooo."
3.0,"Beautiful rings, but I ordered four (some for friends) and they all broke within a couple months. They were worn almost every day, but still so sad they broke!"
3.0,Good looking coat. fabric is a bit loud and stiff. Ended up returning.
3.0,Very much a costum dress
3.0,This is nice but smaller than I expected.
3.0,"Cute and fashionable but thin and has no pocket to insert a protective layer. I slit it open and added a n95 layer and sewed it back but I will be removing that layer and adding a pocket to enable me to easily change the insert periodically. Overall I like the look, not one of those cheap looking patterns at all. Cute and comfy!"
3.0,"They were dark blue, not like the picture. I was expecting more of an aqua color. Overall they are very tiny and super cute."
3.0,"Shirt is advertised as one size to fit all. Once received, I noticed that the size is tagged as medium. The length and width is ok, but the material is thin and the sleeve is very small, as mentioned by another."
3.0,"Beautiful and perfect size unfortunately, my dog ate one and even though he is just a puppy, it got totally shattered so not so sure about the quality though ..."
3.0,"Never thought I would say this but the shafts on these boots are TOO WIDE. I had to add another hole to tighten the top fastener around my knee. They don't look much like what is pictured. Very casual and clunky. More motorcycle riding  than horse hiding in appearance. Mostly stretch fabric and cheap quality. If you have a hard time finding tall boots to fit your calves though, you will have no trouble with these."
3.0,Based on reviews I bought a size smaller and they still too big in the waist while being almost too tight in the legs- and I do not have a particularly small waist. I like high rise jeans cause of the holding your stomach in effect and being too large in the waist kind of defeats the purpose:(
3.0,"Good fabric, not enough stretch for my adult sized head."
3.0,"If they got the sizing right these would easily be four or five-star hose. However, they run two sizes small. the tights themselves are quite well made. they are truly and opague black. They are comfortable and seem to be run and snag resistant. the waistband doesn't roll and they fell good on. But the caveat is the sizing is way off. The XX-Large is a comfortable large. If you can figure out the sizing they are fine."
3.0,"the shawl came in on time, just the fur disappointed me a little."
3.0,"I love the cream and tortoise frames. I got this set to take with me on a beach vacation to Jamaica where I wouldn‚Äôt care if I lost any of them in the sea. I threw away the black pair because the lenses were so cheap. You could hardly see through them, they had a weird distortion."
3.0,"Had to change the rating. It was a gift. Unfortunately, the string is fraying between the beads and my son is afraid it will break now. He‚Äôs worn it for only 5 months."
3.0,While these are super pretty and I will be able to use what I bought them for. You don't get the entire alphabet there aren't any K or H in this package.
3.0,"Did some research on this brand and came up with mixed reviews.<br /><br />The positives is that it has a nose foam, and outer nose wire which provides a better seal. The price isn't that bad either. There was a filtration test done in 2020 I believe with this mask and they did rate well during that time.<br /><br />The negatives is that I believe that they used those test results to advertise there mask and its a no no from those people that test these mask. Another negative is that the bag inside the box was ripped when I got the box. The box was ok but the bag inside was ripped so who knows how long those mask have been exposed to air. They are not sterile but I expect the bag to be in tact. Also, alot of reviews for KN95 mask complain about ear loops being too small and I usually ignore that because the people that do those reviews have big heads. My head is fairly small so ear loops are not an issues but these ear loops are tight on my small head and they fall off my ears very quickly. I need to use a ear loop extender. Another negative is that some of the weld spots on the mask penetrate the mask so that means that when you pull on the straps, they break off. Not all of them have this but a majority of them have it.<br /><br />So overall, the mask has what it takes to be a good mask but the workmen ship ruined the mask because of the quality control and broken bag. The seller could have checked the bag before shipping it out maybe?<br /><br />Minus one star for quality control. Minus one star for not even having a bag that is not busted in the box (not a shipping issue because the box was fine but the seller/manufacture). I got these from Grace Blinds."
3.0,"I purchased and picked the size based on the measurements provided compared to mine.  I was a closest to the Large so got that and it fit nicely  Form fitting but not too tight.  I decided to return as the pants showed panty lines, a little to form fitting for my tastes, and I was hoping to wear these as regular pants as well as yoga pants.  If working out in them only they would have been fine."
3.0,Size was wrong
3.0,"The sizing on this product is crazy.  I normally wear a large in most items of this type, with this product I ordered a 3XL and it was still very small.  I would have had to order at least a 5XL to get a proper fit.  The sizing system for this product is from fantasyland."
3.0,I tore the very first time my granddaughter put them on.  The quality was not very good!  Will not buy again!!!!
3.0,"I ordered one blue necklace,  and one purple necklace  and I received 2 purple"
3.0,"The back laces up, which is cute, but too low. The girls‚Äô little booty cracks were showing"
3.0,"Bought two of these. They are really nice but run very small, unfortunately had to return them."
3.0,"My daughter loves this, but it had a snag in the fabric. Because of the super long ship time, my daughter did not want me to exchange it."
3.0,An ok buy for the price
3.0,"Very shiny but cheaply made. I am keeping because it is nice enough looking & I hope my 18 year old grand daughter likes it. It not, I will wear when I can."
3.0,"Sad to say, the inside zipper broke and inside strap came off.  It was easy to spot and took a beating.  Is there a warranty on those broken items?"
3.0,Ok for cheap costume jewelry
3.0,"Beautiful necklace, but the charm broke off as soon as I opened the package."
3.0,"constructed well ,sizing is poor says up to size 2 hardly a size 12"
3.0,"I wanted to love this watch. I really did. I gave it to my brother. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô3‚Äù and 250 pounds. I tell you this because I want you to know he‚Äôs not a small man. Why is that important? The watch is too big for his wrist. You have to take it to a jeweler and pay to have a link removed. Bummer.<br /><br />As far as the smart watch function, he was not impressed. It is very limited and the things it does well (counting steps & sleep monitoring) he‚Äôd never do in a dress watch.<br /><br />On the other hand, it‚Äôs a sharp looking dress watch and he gets lots of compliments when wearing it."
3.0,"Overall cute, does not stay over nose when talking."
3.0,"The size was good just slightly big but my daughter is small for her age. She's 5months, 24in long and 14lbs. The lettering was too far down. The placement of the words might be better on a bigger size."
3.0,"There is a weird seem the sticks out along the sides. The material is a bit heavy and stiff. They match some shorts I had purchased as a gift for a friend, so its still ok, I guess, for the aesthetic."
3.0,It is cute but tiny! My little girl is obsessed with moose so she loved it no matter what. I just wish it was bigger than the clasp on her charm necklace...
3.0,Fabric is not what it looks like in the picture. Nice fit
3.0,"Unlike the other reviews I found this dress to fix larger than expected. So I returned it. The quality however was exceptional.  I will order again but in the correct size. It is the perfect dress for ; church, easter and a wedding..... it is  semi dressy. It is very colorful and has flowers. I dont think I would wear this on a date with the hubby in the floral version.  But it is a good buy for the money. The fabric is not thin so you could actually not wear a slip if you didnt want too.  As far as the size, I wear a size 8 normally I ordered the 12 and and it was way too big."
3.0,Pro: they do look as advertised so no problem with the appearance.<br />Con: they are tight even though what I bought should be a have size larger than needed. The top lip kind of digs into the top of your foot and I think that may lead to rubbing the skin raw wearing these any distance wet after being in the pool. Wouldn't buy these again.
3.0,"This product was beautiful and color.  But do to being big breasted it didnt seem to lay correctly with the lace part.  So it didnt look right, Gave it as a gift to a little small built person with small breast and it fit great and looked great."
3.0,A+++ ITEM!!
3.0,Waistband rolls down with exercise
3.0,Ok good
3.0,Megusta es calintito y us una tesitura de calida
3.0,"Looks just like the picture, just gold is lighter and the bow I had to fix"
3.0,It is a high quality item that was packaged beautifully! I bought it for credit cards and money. I could not fit the credit cards in unless they scraped against the zipper. The two inside pockets were almost impossible to use. Basically the opening to the coin purse was way too small for my needs.
3.0,"the band is very flimsy, I was disappointed upon opening the package. the over all packaging is nice but the band fell apart after only 2 weeks.  I had some difficulty getting the band on my watch, I really had to push it in with force. it came with a clear protector for the watch as well and it was just as flimsy and turned yellow rather quick. i take my watch off before bed and before washing my hands. I don't know how it could possibly turn yellow ?"
3.0,"Very thin material, definitely needs a liner of some type in order to be decent."
3.0,"Definitely NOT FOR TALL PEOPLE.  I am 5'10 and only weigh 129lbs, but it was way too short for my torso.<br />The material was great and the product looked wonderful.  I left only 3 stars because the seller should have mentioned the length on the product and what height it would fit for."
3.0,"For the price, they are ok.  THe design on them does look a lot cheaper than expected but they are for my little sister and she will still like them."
3.0,I'm Tiny Framed & Tiny In The Chest Area ... I Even Ordered The M/L Based On Reviews - THAT Was Even Too Small!!!
3.0,Is pretty but I have to return because of somewhat large. Mt
3.0,"I believe this bracelet is small for the average man's wrist. Not only is it a little too small, the strings that have been tied and glued are left to hang long on the wrist.<br />I purchased the &#34;French&#34; bracelet, which doubles as a USA bracelet. I wish they would include that in the listing!<br />The bracelet is made of leather. It smells of leather and has the same texture. It is comfortable to wear, but uncomfortable to wear once it is wear or there is perspiration.<br />I was provided this product, at no cost, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Like you, I am an amazon shopper and I rely on product reviews when making my purchases. I would never award 5 stars to an inferior product. I hope you found my review helpful."
3.0,"I would give this watchband a five if I didn‚Äôt have to wrestle it off my wrist every day. The watch band is so stiff, that it takes me a couple of minutes to wrestle it past the very large closer clip while pressing it against my skin tightly to get it to release. Super loose fit due to the tightness."
3.0,"To small, to bad, loved it, sent back, waiting on refund."
3.0,The styling of this hat is amazing. Love the look. Problem - the hat is really shallow.... hard to get all the way down to fit snuggly like most flat-billed mesh hats
3.0,Sweater is not as bulky as picture shows. Very thin and ryns small.
3.0,"I'm sure glad I got the XL rather than my usual M. I'm 5'6, 145 lbs and it's not nearly as flowy and long on me as the pictures. The blouse will just barely cover my butt if I pull it all the way down, but then it doesn't stay there. The pictures show two different grey colors, a solid and a heathered, the shirt is heathered. The pockets are nice for hands but not deep/angled enough to trust with my phone. I'm keeping it since it is cozy, but I wont order other colors as I had hoped."
3.0,"The jeans were nice and fit well, but the first thing I noticed is they were longer than I expected. Then, when starting to wear them I noticed the hem was either not there, or already came apart. Not sure if it's supposed to be a frayed look on the hem or not."
3.0,"These adapters are way too expensive for what you get and how much effort it takes to fit on a G-shock. They're just pieces of rubber that are way too large for any watch. In order to fit them in a G-shock, the sides of the joint need to be sanded down. I've attached a picture that shows where to sand.<br /><br />If these things were a couple of dollars, they might be worth it. Unfortunately, at their cost you might as well spend a little bit more for a jaysandkays adapter. I cannot recommend these adapters for any watch, even if they didn't need to be filed down."
3.0,This is a one layer mask<br />No spot for a filter<br /><br />Made very simply<br /><br />Thin
3.0,"These pants seem to be well made, but they run extremely small.  I ordered a size up based on other reviews and they still are fit rather tightly.<br />These fit more like leggings than sweatpants and I never wear leggings.  These pants are probably fine for someone who is very small but I would not order them again."
3.0,Heavier than expected.
3.0,"The lenses are well made. But being readers I often tilt them up so the lenses are on top of my head. It stretched out the hinges and now they don‚Äôt fit right. If I didn‚Äôt wear them on top of my head, they‚Äôd be great. The case is nice and it‚Äôs a great price."
3.0,Painful to take off but looks super cute
3.0,"These are so cute and look best in a first or second hole, but they get so uncomfortable at the top where it hooks over."
3.0,"Good shoes,  but the bottom tred lasted less then a month so non-slip should not be your buying point,  but they look cool"
3.0,"This is a little snalll, but super cute. I‚Äôll just never dry it!"
3.0,Cute heavy sweater that seems to be well made but I would say it‚Äôs 2-3‚Äù shorter in length than the picture looks. I bought to wear with leggings but will have to wear it with jeans instead.
3.0,"These were super cute, but a little tight and small for a size 11M shoe."
3.0,They are ok.  Wouldn‚Äôt order again.  The fabric is so rough.
3.0,I like the texture of the dress but it's  a little big for me.
3.0,"The ends poke into my wrist, and make this bracelet very uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,"Does what they say. Generally comfortable, the seams are a little odd. The thread from seams in multiple places is already coming loose however."
3.0,Wasn't happy with this dress. I think ingot it too big . I got a medium because I picked up serious weight lately.  Inusually fit between a small and medium . Went with medium to be on safe side . It was roomy.  Let's just say it looks better on the model than it does to me .
3.0,"Not sure what size feet these reviewers have, but they are enormous! I‚Äôm an 8 1/2, and I could fit a foot and a half in these. The large as per the size chart and reviews. They are super wide as well so that it‚Äôs almost able to accommodate both my feet in one slipper with wise, not to mention  so long I could ski in them.<br />I‚Äôm returning and going to try a medium. Not sure they‚Äôll do because I think all these people must have wide feet. Mine aren‚Äôt narrow but not quite a b width. But even still, I‚Äôve never had an issue with slippers made for big foot at the size stated in the charts.<br />The 3 rating is due to the poor sizing charts. Otherwise they look comfy.  But the sizing does remind me of the Cinderella story only they goofed the size to fool the wearer.<br />Beware of the largess-ness of these slippers. YUGE.<br />I‚Äôll update my review when I receive the next size down."
3.0,I gave this watchband 3 stars because it arrived with a missing rhinestone. Its a beautiful band but I was afraid that if it arrived with one missing then others would fall out with normal wear. I was very disappointed and returned it immediately.
3.0,"Look and quality seem good and the fit is somewhat small; however, if had gone up a size, may have been too big to wear comfortably. the back of the heal portion tends to get tucked under the heal of foot, which becomes uncomfortable; however, there is plenty of room in the toe area (almost a little too much); keeps feet warm ... a little too warm if you are naturally on the warmer side ... so have to remove slippers from time to time to let feet cool"
3.0,Fit is great and it‚Äôs so cute! I could not keep it on for more than 10 minutes. I‚Äôm not a picky person when it comes to material but it was just too itchy for me!
3.0,"Poor quality, the z√≠per sticks. It runs big. 5‚Äô2‚Äô‚Äô 135lb and 4/6 was still too large"
3.0,"Much smaller than I thought, but they are cute."
3.0,The shirts are somehow both too small and too loose. I bought size medium and they were the length of a small but the fit of a large. Decent material but not what I was expecting. These would probably work well for someone with broad shoulders and a short torso.
3.0,"I put these on expecting to see everything as clearly as stated on TV, but they didn't improve my night vision.  The headlights of cars coming toward me still had the &#34;starbursts&#34; as usual.  My husband does say they are helpful to him, so it could be just my eyesight."
3.0,"Quality is good. But twice I had to return it.<br /><br />I am 5'9"", 130 lbs, and both of them were large and x large, and it barely covered my butt and front. I liked to be able to walk around my home without the robe, and if a neighbor could see in anywhere, I would prefer to be covered. AND this is made for anyone under 5'2"".<br />Finally returned the second one and found another one from another seller.<br />And this would have been the second time in the last couple of years buying this nightie, but they changed it completely, the last one I loved and was hoping to receive the same one.<br />Seems they changed distributor, and is from the land of the little people."
3.0,"I bought it so I can clip it to my bags but the plastic clip is so stiff can't clip it, just gave up. The zipper keeps getting stuck"
3.0,The band was of extremely poor quality and I had to immediately replace it. The watch itself is nice.
3.0,They stay in the strap loops nice but the edges can be a bit rough.
3.0,"The gloves do a pretty good job of keeping my hands warm. However, the ‚Äúgold‚Äù finger tips do not work on my Apple electronics."
3.0,Good length. Love the cut but it felt a size too tight
3.0,These were hard to get adjusted and put on correctly. We bought them for a Prom dress and my daughter ended up taking them off on the way to the dance.
3.0,"The fit was fine but it rises as you walk so I spent the entire night pulling my dress down. However, it is cute and fit as expected."
3.0,The earrings are absolutely lovely simple and delicate! Unfortunately they came horribly tangled to each other in multiple knots as the chain is very thin! I spent 30 minutes looking up hacks on how to untangle jewelry and fighting the knots with a paper clip and baby oil. 30 minutes wasted of my life!<br /><br />There must be a better way to package your merchandise guys so you don‚Äôt put your customers through this!!!!
3.0,An OK product.
3.0,"Not all the lights light up on one shoe but my daughter had already worn them by the time we noticed.  Also, the little plug ins to recharge them hurt her foot when stuck inside the shoe.  So, she walks around with them sticking out, which looks pretty silly.  A little disappointed."
3.0,well overall fit is very adjustable which is a plus for me because whenever I lose weight my boobs fluctuate. but I have 36 DDD so let‚Äôs see how this goes later at the gym!
3.0,"My daughter is a huge grinch fan so she adores these. I‚Äôd love to give a 5 star rating, however they came with a hole in them. Right under the zipper. Which is sad especially with how much we paid for them."
3.0,Wanted sweatpants not cotton pants. T-shirt material.
3.0,"I gave this dress a three star because of some things maybe they can fix. One, the belt that comes with it is loose. It has no belt loops and can fall down since the material is made with polyester. The whole dress is made of polyester so if that throws you off from the photos beware. I would have liked it to have a little % of cotton. It dresses like a momo dress until you tie the belt. Really has no shape to it. I do love all the pattern and colors they provide. If you find another one that is similar and has the belt loop buy that one."
3.0,"You'd need your child to wear a slip with this. Also, it runs small. It's supposed to be lose and flowing so size up."
3.0,"I love tank tops year around and was excited to try this one. This tank runs much larger than the tank tops I've purchased to date. I ordered a large thinking it would be fitted but looser than the smaller sizes and this one was far too big for me (I'm 5'4"", 34B, 130 pounds). The  material feels very stretchy and slippery, kind of cheap to me. The fit was very odd; it was baggy and shapeless, as if it was stretched out. It was certainly not flattering on me and although I should have tried a small, I can't imagine that would have improved how saggy the shape is.<br /><br />I ordered the red which looked to be a deeper shade of red. It is actually a bright red and was an orange-red shade, not a blue-red (if you love blue-reds, you know what I mean). I was also disappointed with this.<br /><br />Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this tank."
3.0,This items's zipper doesn't work very good and when zipped it doesn't lay flat.  There is something inside the Hem - it feels like a bug üò®
3.0,"Me Gusta, es ideal para el verano porque es una tela fresca"
3.0,Looks cheap up close but nice from a distance.
3.0,We only use cold water wash & it still shrank... Fit well before washing
3.0,Sparkles come off very easily. Daughter still loves the shoes though.
3.0,Like the style and the white collar on the inside giving it a more polished look.  The fabric however has a slight sheen which accentuated those dreaded bulges.  Fits basically as expected except for those few places.  Did over a larger size but suspect that it will be too big.  Will see.  Have not worn it in the heat so don't know it breaths/ feels in the heat as some sun shirt just seem hot.
3.0,It's comfy and feels good . I expected the bigger size to fit looser then it does .my only disappointment is the sleeves are not down to the wrists
3.0,"Before I bought another bra. but decided to try this one, the price is cheaper. The size is too small. And it's not comfortable"
3.0,Hat is good but I bought for the insignia‚Äî-  way too small for people to read
3.0,I really like these glasses.  I opened one pair and have been using every day.  However I opened the other pair to give to my husband and the frame was bent. I'm surprised because these are very heavy duty frames. I tried to straighten out but wasn't very successful.  So I guess my complaint would be with packaging it was shipped? Otherwise I LOVE these.
3.0,"Hubs says it's okay,  he feels like it's boxy cut to it. More wide than long. Looks okay unless he puts his arms up. Would not order again"
3.0,A bit large but embroidered bit is nice
3.0,"I went by the actual suggested measurements, took a fabric tape and double checked my hat size (which I already knew from military service). I read all the most recent reviews concerning sizing, and the hat was way too large for 7-3/8.<br /><br />Appears to be a good quality hat, but decided to return it and search for something more along the lines that I was looking for. YMMV."
3.0,Love the look but stunned they didn't have D cup.  Tried for C cup but not going to work.  TIme for an Amazon return....
3.0,So hear is my only problem with this product it came damaged but if it not for that I would of love it I bought is as a birthday gift unfortunately I had to return it because I‚Äôd damages not  the product I really like it
3.0,"I ordered a size 3 and received a size 7 and it was shipped from China!  How on earth do I return it?  It was a long time coming too.  I would not order this again.  Don't know how it washes and wears, since size is wrong, I will not be3 giving it as a gift."
3.0,"This is a very pretty ring which actually does look quite realistic. The sizes seem to run a little big, I ordered my usual size and it was huge, but I liked it so much I ordered another 2 sizes smaller and it fit perfectly. It didn't turn my finger green (as some have posted) however it did cause serious irritation causing my finger to become red, itchy and swollen :( I was so dissappointed as visually it is very lovely. I am going to put some clear nail polish on the back of it and try it again. My engagement ring was stolen when our house was broken into and there's no way I can afford to replace it so am really hoping the polish does the trick so I can use this as a fill-in."
3.0,Does not stay clasped
3.0,It was very nice but too big for me. I returned it.
3.0,The quality of the nylons on the legs and feet is a rough feeling. The material for the sheath is AMAZING!
3.0,"These were difficult to put over your shoes and difficult to take off your shoes.  Not something you want to just put on and go, it takes a while to get on and then off."
3.0,it is not what I expected but ok
3.0,Runs small.. Nice though I gave it to a very small person fits them great
3.0,Earrings seem like decent quality. I haven't worn any yet so hopefully they don't turn my ears green. There are 2 pairs that can't be used. The beading on one earring was broken in the package. Another set don't match - one earring has the black rhinestones and the other doesn't.
3.0,Nice material but very short
3.0,I ordered these robes for my bridesmaids but I was disappointed to find that their largest size does not fit two of my size 12 bridesmaids. I returned them and I will continue to look for larger sizes.
3.0,"It cleans, but it doesn't protect and seal leather like I expected. My hat still ended up with water spots after getting a few drops on it."
3.0,They are heavier than I was expecting
3.0,Much smaller than I thought.  Not nicely displayed in a box either. Very difficult to add photos.
3.0,"Bought them for lounging around and sleeping in.  Way too long in the legs.  Just because some of us need a bigger size, doesn't mean our legs are grotesquely long."
3.0,"Very very small--more appropriate for a young girl, so they'll become a gift."
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 175 lbs, it was much shorter on me than expected. I do like it and have been wearing it as a tunic top. It fits baggy, but only just covers my butt."
3.0,"Be sure to check to see if what you purchase if for ""plus size"" or regular. This product was a regular fit and didn't fit me!..So, back it goes. Not bad product but typical cotton briefs."
3.0,I am the only guy in a yoga class so I am careful about what I wear. This do not work in that regard.
3.0,Like the earrings however; they turn my ears black where they hang.
3.0,See through and too big everywhere but the bitties. I wear it as a swimsuit cover up but definitely not by itself.
3.0,Thought it would be a lot bigger
3.0,"Job changed, so didn't get much use.  I like how it looks with khaki pants."
3.0,"While I loved the plaid design, the quality was cheap. And the sizing is off! For medium the top was roomy while the shorts where way too small."
3.0,"I received this product in the color White Leopard.<br /><br />Packaging<br />The glasses arrived in a timely manner and the glasses were neither damaged nor open upon arrival.<br /><br />Style<br />The glasses are very feminine and beautiful. I really like the leopard design as it really brings out the beauty of the glasses. Bear in mind that the lenses are non-polarized, so they do not block the glare from reflected light; they only block intense light.<br /><br />Sun Protection<br />When purchasing polarized lenses that is one risk the consumer will never have to worry about because they offer 100% protection against UVA and UVB rays. That's one big difference between polarized and non-polarized sun glasses. These glasses are non-polarized, so I'm not 100% sure about their ability to protect the eyes from the sun.<br /><br />Comfort<br />Although the glasses look great, they aren't very comfortable after wearing for a long time. I would recommend that you wear these for activities that don't require long-time wear.<br /><br />Durability<br />The material of the glasses is quite strong.  It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy at all.  This surprised me as the lens and material are said to be made of plastic.<br /><br />I don't know if it's just the color I got, but if you're someone who likes sunglasses because people can't tell what you're looking at, these aren't for you. They are very, very reflective. I personally don't mind this, so this was not really an issue for me.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discounted or free price for evaluation purposes in return for my unbiased review, which I have provided here.

3.0,Okay for price...
3.0,Item came damaged but was compensated accordingly.
3.0,"very pretty dress, but absolutely tiny!"
3.0,First I did like the flowered print and material so that got a 3. It was too small so I returned it. I bought another dress in the size I take and it for just fine.
3.0,"The chain was what I had expected, however the clasp is very difficult to close."
3.0,Honestly they are a little cheap ... but you get what you pay for . They tore very easy and had a weird run going down the left leg. I'll just  go to the store and get them next time
3.0,"I ordered these by mistake, but decided to check them out. They are pretty small. I have long skinny fingers and these gloves are too tight. I usually can get away with wearing smaller gloves, if they have some stretch in em. Not these. I would say they are good for chicks and those of you out there with tiny lil' handies (i.e. Carnies!). They do look pretty cool though and they are made of decent quality."
3.0,Not a good fit and no support
3.0,The waste was very snug. Otherwise it was ok. Fabric kind of stiff but may soften with several washes. The color was nice.
3.0,I love cupshe and the top fit great but the bottoms were a little big for me. I'm normally a small but had to get a medium for the top. I had to cut the sides on the bottoms and tie them tighter for it to fit. For your reference I am 5'7 125lbs 32D
3.0,Fits small across bust. The sleeves feel like 3/4 sleeves versus full sleeve. Pretty solid material. The draping is beautiful.
3.0,I'm going to keep it because it's so cute. It runs really small. If you buy you may want to go up 3 sizes.
3.0,sizing is off
3.0,They ended up turning immediately and I didn't think that they would I was under the impression after reading the description it was stainless steel but that is not the case within a week it was turning
3.0,If you have a lot of hips this outfit will look great but the need to look at the inner stitching cause it shows an unevenness in the pants legs when you put it on . It flaps too much too.
3.0,Very small. The end falls off easily.
3.0,The dress they sent had a different floral design than the one I ordered. The design they sent isn‚Äôt even pictured.  I love how it fits. I wear it around the house.
3.0,"Am sure they are a fine product, but doesn‚Äôt fit my glasses."
3.0,"the watch is inexpensive and looks beautiful, received a couple of weeks ago and I have worn it once since I received it the battery is already dead and needs to be replaced."
3.0,When this arrived it was broken...however I plan to fix it because I love it
3.0,This would never fit a woman's body in a million years unless you're a woman who's lucky enough to be a size 4 or smaller. This is built more for a junior than a lady.
3.0,This is a totally cute coat but make sure you order up. I only went up one size and should have gone up two sizes.  It is not as long as I thought as it goes directly to your waist.
3.0,"This is a gorgeous piece, but arrived broken in two at the center"
3.0,Beautiful dress but runs big.
3.0,Warm and comfortable but is advertised as &#34;knee highs&#34; when they should say &#34;thigh highs.&#34;  Foot size as expected.
3.0,"Like the width, but the actual colors are not as distinctive as pictured in the ad.  Fabric is nice though."
3.0,It is a nice watch but it started peeling . I thought it read stainless steel. I paid almost $60 for it.it should not be tarnishing.  Just found out tonight when I asked him why he don't wear it. . .
3.0,Super heavy and falls off and can break easily.
3.0,"The moons weren‚Äôt even attached and there was only one star. Thankfully A hobby of mine is jewelry, so I‚Äôll just fix it."
3.0,These were great buy for vacation!
3.0,Super cute shoes but run WAY too small. Super bummed. I can never understand the sizing on these shoes.
3.0,"It‚Äôs nice.<br />Just feels, cheap, but overall I‚Äôll use it"
3.0,These glasses used to be thin and lightweight. I think they must have cost saved them because now the glass is thick (even for =150). Very disappointing.
3.0,"Not good quality, but they were fun"
3.0,"I like the length and full feel of the skirt. However, I gave it 3 stars because of the deceptive trade practice of the seller. Looking at the pictures you would think its a dress, but its just a skirt and its not African Print Dashiki. Its more like a Polyester. If you are African, you would think its Ankara but its not so be careful don't be deceived by the picture.<br />Also its runs really small, I am a size 12 or 14 and I ordered XXL cos I expect it to be from China, and it fits like a size 12 not even 14!<br />And this applies to any of the &#34;so called&#34; {African Print} on Amazon, they are not cotton African Fabric like Dashiki or Ankara."
3.0,"Stylish and stay put, but they‚Äôre a bit too tight for me. I don‚Äôt have a big head, but these headbands cause anything from slight discomfort to a headache. If I wear sunglasses the headband presses them against my temples so hard it hurts after a little while."
3.0,Pretty loose fitting and not very flattering.
3.0,My granddaughter likes them but it is running small. She is 9 and once washed she can no longer wear it.
3.0,I‚Äôm upset because I tried the largest one and it was too small
3.0,"It's pretty, but the top had an elastic piece too tight. I had to cut it. Also fringes hang off the lace top. I had to cut them off."
3.0,Cute but definitely runs small! Seems like youth size instead of adult.
3.0,"Cute idea, but it was a little too slouchy, and the underside of the dress is a faded white color. So it looked weird considering you see the underside of the dress the whole time because of the style. I got a medium,but seemed bigger. Unfortunately, I returned."
3.0,Love the coat but it arrived with a loose stitch on one sleeve and a couple teeth missing on the zipper which makes it a challenge to zip cup
3.0,This shirt is made of very lightweight material.
3.0,"It was a gift for my mom. She gets tons of compliments on it. My only issue is that when I received it, the stone on the bracelet part was not attached. I had to open the package and super glue it back before giving it as a gift."
3.0,I purchased a small and Xsmall(4-6). My child is almost 9 wearing 7-8s in most clothing. Even the Xsmall there was plenty of room to be comfortable.
3.0,"This dress is really well made, does not look cheap; however, I ordered a yellow and it was see through."
3.0,"The smell, of adhesive, on these gloves literally made my eyes water. I have done everything to remove that smell. Then on top of that, the rhinestone decoration is sticky and it sticks as you try to peel them apart. Ruined one pair. Too much adhesive all the way around. I dont know if Im ever going to be able to wear them. They are cute tho."
3.0,"I will preface this review with saying it was a very smooth and easy return so no complaints there. The pants were super thin and low quality, feeling more like pjs than pants. I NEVER return anything but these also had a huge stitch error in the front middle pant leg so that was the main reason I ended up returning them. Very disappointing pants but very easy return process."
3.0,"For women with larger tops and smaller bottoms, you better off purchasing separates"
3.0,Good price but thinner cheap material than other yoga pants with pockets.  The spandex is lose doesn‚Äôt snug your legs.  Feels like when your yoga pants get old snd lose the stretch.
3.0,"Like most of these other reviews I agree the over all quality and construction are top notch, but the design simply doesn‚Äôt do the job for me. The toe box area is far too flat to provide any kind of stretch in the leather to help prevent creasing. If they cut the last a bit thicker they‚Äôd be perfect. And the ankle part doesn‚Äôt really offer much. Might as well buy regular shoe trees."
3.0,"For some reason, one of my earrings chain length is longer than the other. Also product received is not the same as the product in the photos. The chain is not as fine (it's made of larger and thicker jump rings) and the droplet is cheap and plastic looking, not as sparkly and pretty in the photos. The actual wing part is also has a dull finish. But for $2 I can't really complain all that much."
3.0,Loved everything about it except the length. The underneath skirt is just to short for a 5 yr old. Makes it hard for her to get it pulled down right.
3.0,"It does look like the picture and fit as expected, it's just not very well made. When i first tried it on, the stitches started coming out at the hem between the pink band and the white lace. If you are handy, a few reinforcer stitches should do the trick. I'm just worried it is going to happen in other places the more that i wear the dress, i don't know that i would chance running it through the washer."
3.0,"Super cute, but runs really small. Feels a bit more like a novelty than an actual winter hat."
3.0,"These are very pretty and do have an easy pocket for filters, but the nose wire is sharp and pokes my nose."
3.0,"Looks like decent quality, but does run a bit large."
3.0,The gold plating came off. But daughter still wears it
3.0,"These have foam soles, not the much longer lasting rubber soles (used to be called ""Omni"")."
3.0,Gloves are nice but not warm...
3.0,It beautiful but the chain broke day 1
3.0,Works okay still ended up using glue
3.0,"for the money is what i expected, watch your measurements"
3.0,"Fit too tight, but at least the hinges bend out. Unless you're a very small person, these are only really good for costume purposes (not going to give you adequate sun protection)."
3.0,quality didn't seem good enough to keep. I returned it
3.0,Not for tall people!
3.0,Very good grip on glasses not too heavy
3.0,Ordered a Men's Medium/Large.  This is the smallest ML I've tried on in quite some time.  Thumb was too long for length and not wide enough for width.  Index finger was tight.  I'd size up if purchasing this specific model.
3.0,I have fairly long arms and thought this might be good based on the pictures. Wrong. While I do still like this sweater I always have the sleeves rolled up because my arms are too long for them.
3.0,"It was very cheaply made, but worked for a night of trick or treating. Don't expect it to last much longer than that."
3.0,It was adv. as cotton but it was really contained a small amount of cotton
3.0,I bought one size up and its still a little smaller than I am comfortable in and its LONG!
3.0,"I really liked the light feel of this cap. The quality seems fine. It feels like it would be cool to wear, which is important to keep you from sweating all day. Unfortunately, it is really small. I can't even get it on. If they had a larger size I would probably try it, but it is for a very petite woman."
3.0,"I have been using rocky boots for the second time and some times they need ( you rocky company needs to define what kind of size are the boots that they explain respect to be D, M or W!"
3.0,While these slippers are super quick and fit well there are a few issues I have with them.  First off they draw a lot of power- tried using my ipad charger and it didn't supply enough power.  Next plugged into my laptop and started getting power surge messages.  Finding a place to keep these powered has been a challenge to say the least.  Next is the location of the cords- right at the back of your heel- not great if you're laying in a recliner with you're feet up.  Lastly they only have heat on the bottom so if you have cold toes like I do it only partly keeps them warm- the tops of my toes are still cold.<br />Cute product but it could be made a lot better with a few tweaks.
3.0,"Jeans look very nice - color, the shape, but it fits too small. I‚Äôve ordered size 14, which is usually a little big for me, but this jeans turned out to fit very tight. I love the look, but do not feel comfortable wearing them; hence, 3 stars only."
3.0,The shoes are cute but to big
3.0,I bought this set mostly for the chain and the gems. It gave my crocs the little flare I needed. However the chair seems cheaply made. The butterfly is ok but it is really big.
3.0,To be honest the price is great on a budget until we can get a better ring. Fit is nice and from a distance looks nice. But honestly very cheap.
3.0,"It is a nice, fluffy coat. I really like the khaki color. I was worried it may look too shiny and fake, but it doesn't. The length is similar to the picture and I am 5' 8 1/2"" tall. It fit well so I would suggest normal sizing. The only thing i dont like about it is that the sleeves were too short. My arms are long and the sleeves stopped about an inch or so from my wrist. I also like loose sleeves at the end, this has the fitted look and makes the sleeves pull up and look even shorter."
3.0,"Pendant is really cute for a child (that's who we got it for), but, as remarked, the chain is not very good quality.  Fortunately, I have already bought a satin cord for it."
3.0,The sweater quality was very nice but I wear a medium and ordered the large and it was much too small.
3.0,The strap on the watch is terribly hideous.  It not even tan and looks close to my skin tone‚Ä¶the watch itself looks really good and its such a shame they put really cheap strap in it. For 50 dollars its ok and that is why I put 3 stars in it‚Ä¶. but if you paid 250 bucks for it then I feel so sorry but the watch will disappoint you. I wish it would look like the picture‚Ä¶Consider the Rudiger Siegen models‚Ä¶. I bought two of those for around 120-140 dollars and the quality and design is just overwhelming for the price‚Ä¶definitely a lot better.
3.0,"The broach was cute, but the clasp on the back was kind of cheap and doesn't hold very well.  Bought this for my wife and the clasp kept coming apart.  She finally had to take it off instead of risking losing it."
3.0,"Very cute hat, but way too snug for my 2 year old. Her head circumference is just before 19inches, which should've been fine according to the description, but it was a tiiiightt tight fit. She only wore it maybe twice because it does provide good, all around shade, and the adjustable draw string was a plus too."
3.0,"Beware if your wrist is near the large end of the fit range. It does fit, but because it is a Speidel expandable type bracelet it feels tight. I will be giving to my son.<br /><br />Too bad because it does look nice."
3.0,It's not a real santa cruz brand. However it is a nice hat.
3.0,"This belt looks nice, but started coming apart in less than a week.  But, I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,The detail and quality was very accurate had a few complaints one it was a little too small and the zipper felt cheap like it could break at any time. Was a pretty cozy jacket if it's a little nippy outside.
3.0,"The size and strap length was great , but the color was not as deep and rich as it appears. In the picture. Some stiching was loose.  I decided to keep it because I was headed to a festival and needed something right away. It already has various water spots from my carelessness. Every little spot shows. I had a different deep black suede bag that I carried for a long time without showing stains. Ultimately, I think I need a leather, wipeable bag because I play hard."
3.0,"nice product, got large (usually go with medium) but really needed x-large.  cut small"
3.0,"I ordered this dress for my engagement photos. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and I sized down to an XS instead of a medium which is my normal size. I loved the way the dress looked sized down but it was loose around the chest and was a little revealing. I found myself adjusting it throughout the photos.<br />Also, I ordered this dress in dark green and it stained everything I touched in green. I tried to wash the dress to remove some dye and it changed the color of the straps of the dress to a light green color that looked terrible. Overall poor quality. It works for pictures but not functional and poor quality. I was bummed out in regard to this product especially after reading so many great reviews."
3.0,I ordered this for an adult but I think it's design is more for a teen or young adult. I also wish chain was longer. Nice piece but I think I will give to someone younger or maybe make a key chain.
3.0,"These boot cut yoga pants are comfortable. The material is soft and smooth. There are no pockets. They are the perfect length for me. I ordered in a Large. I typically wear a 2XL. I am 5'5"" 250lbs. They are not sheer/see through, however, the material is thin. I would wear with a longer top to cover panty lines or unsightly bulges. I wouldn't say these pants have tummy control... the elastic waistband is sewn in loosely, which will allow room for twisting. I may mostly wear these as PJ pants."
3.0,"It is exactly what you expect a nice quality bowling shirt, I'm 5'11 and 160lbs and the Medium was a tent on me. i bought this for a friends party so it still worked great, but drop a size down if you want something a bit more fitted."
3.0,"The dress is way to big for me. The fit is somehow way off as well. I ordered a small in red and 1 in yellow, I am 5'4 130lbs. Material was good, color was great. Tried to give it away but no takers."
3.0,These tend to hurt your ears after wearing them for even 20 minutes. Surely it is due to the magnet pressing against both sides of your ear lobe. Possibly the best you can get when it comes to magnetic earrings. Lost interest rather quickly however.
3.0,"I figured this would save me some time braiding my own hair. It didn't. For what this product is it's great, good quality and very flexible, however if you can braid/ plait your own hair I suggest just doing that."
3.0,"I ordered the blue Santa leather earrings and they are exactly as shown.  Notice that one is stamped backwards in the picture.  Notice that all the earrings with writing have one backwards.  Otherwise, the color is good and the shipping was quick.  I would LOVE them if both were stamped correctly."
3.0,"Its much more firmer than the original and very hard. However, I could not fine the original so I guess this would have to do."
3.0,Strings way too long.
3.0,Turns finger green.  Size is too big.
3.0,Straps to small
3.0,Nice but too thick
3.0,"They do the job but they‚Äôre very tiny. I am a petite women so I figured men‚Äôs would be fine of maybe big but they‚Äôre so tight on me that you can see the outline of my nose and mouth. Maybe they‚Äôll stretch, I‚Äôm not sure."
3.0,"Got nice, but the color was not right. It was red instead of the pink/coral color shown in the photos."
3.0,"Comfy sweater, always liked their material; thin, keeps warm and long lasting material."
3.0,I must have ordered the wrong size....too big but it feels wonderful
3.0,The product says 10 masks.. I received 9. Somebody didn't count correctly before boxing.
3.0,I like the quality of the the leather but it was very difficult to install. The metal pins broke off right away and now I cant get it off my fitbit.
3.0,Too short unfortunately.
3.0,Sizes run small. Shrunk even more during washing.
3.0,Todav√≠a no lo vi
3.0,"The material on the garment is great.  The one complaint is the side pockets, they are extremely awkward and it makes one hips look huge."
3.0,Sus
3.0,Wanted it for my nose. They were too big. For my ears too. Think they sent me the wrong size.
3.0,Too much loose threads inside the socks that make them uncomfortable
3.0,The medium hung on me and I am curvy and far from tiny! There was not much of a waist--no shape.  The dress is cute and great quality. This style just did not look nice on me.
3.0,super cute ik that its cheap but mines broke to fast.
3.0,Was really happy when I received the necklace only wore a handful of times and didnt get it wet or get anything on it When I went to wear it recently noticed some of the red enamel had peeled off. It‚Äôs a cute necklace but didn‚Äôt last
3.0,These pants fit nicely buy the inside material is so slick it doesn‚Äôt stay put. The pants need a grippy band at the top.
3.0,"Nice hat, would be better if you could get in you're exact hat size instead of one size fits all. Just need a camo kimono to macth"
3.0,Just okay. Fast delivery.
3.0,It looked soooo cute but I couldn‚Äôt keep it in because it hurt. üòï
3.0,"As with the large-lens version, the clip doesn't hold well enough."
3.0,Cute..just not true to size...i am a medium and its way too small
3.0,"For the price, it's amazing. Looks a tad different."
3.0,Not very secure
3.0,"Super cute, but they fall off too easy. My daughter is 7 mos old and these fall right off her feet:(hopefully they will stay on better as she grows into them.."
3.0,"After wearing it only once, a pendant fell off. Luckily I found it in time and was able to put it back on. I am weary about wearing it now because I'm afraid another will fall off and I may not be too lucky a second time around."
3.0,"The fabric feels nice but wrinkles a lot.  It's almost impossible to use a seat belt and then still wear the dress due to the wrinkles.  I mainly wear it at home. Also, within the first 2 weeks 3 buttons fell if even though it fits very loosely.  Definitely not great quality."
3.0,"This is so cute and my boyfriend absolutely loves it on me! I ordered two sizes up but honestly could have gone 3 sizes up because of the waist on the skirt. It still works just fine, just have to wear it up pretty high. It is seen together cheaply though, several of the seams were not sewn properly on the skirt and I had to redo them myself, but overall a decent outfit for the price."
3.0,"The dress is okay..  not the same as the picture shown. I ordered a medium and the top is very big (I'm 140, 5'7, 34C) and it still fits too loosely especially in the armpit. But skirt is better proportioned and might be too short if I ordered a size down. I do love the pockets! Pockets on any dresss is a plus. I ordered the Burgandy and the color is great. Just isn't a &#34;wow&#34; dress even for causal wear."
3.0,The waistband is prone to rolling down on me which is uncomfortable. They otherwise worked great as a second layer under a sheer outfit.
3.0,"so it says &#34;one size&#34; and somehow I missed the part where it notes it's only 12 inches long. I thought it would be full size like a real one, just made of plastic....wrong."
3.0,The shoe did not at all fit my daughter.
3.0,"The bill on hat will not curve no matter what you do, and I don't like the duck bill look on me, gave it to my nephew"
3.0,Really loved the earrings. It looks better than the picture however it broke  only the second time I wore it.
3.0,"we ordered 3 dresses in order to get the right fit.  However, I will say that Amazon, makes doing returns very easy.  The second go around, we ordered two  sizes simultaneously  due to timing of prom.  In the end, we  went up two full dress sizes."
3.0,The band is solid but the link remover broke on the first try so now I need to take it to a jeweler.
3.0,"I love how lightweight and flows this skirt is and it‚Äôs the perfect length.  However, it‚Äôs already falling apart in several places after the first west, so now it needs mending."
3.0,"The gloves look great.  However, they are not as warm or wind-resistant as I would like.  My hands were freezing in 35-degree weather."
3.0,"Good watch, lightweight but I like them heavier. Great style"
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:f90db639824d4e901838b2ddc6682649]] As you can see in the photo, I have a blue pair of the same brand. I was really excited to get a new pair because they are so comfy, but they are both left feet. Somewhere someone has two right feet."
3.0,Prettt good fit. Bra cups were ridiculously large for the size though.
3.0,Hats work good for being a pony tail hat but they fit huge I have the Velcro as tight as it‚Äôll go and still stick and they‚Äôre still too big.
3.0,Just ok. The material is a little clingy.
3.0,"These are cute but one pair, which was my favorite, came with two left ear pieces. Most are reversed and this one pair is completely unwearable"
3.0,"Very cute, but the backs do not stay screwed on. I ordered two pairs by this company and they're both this way.  Lost one of each pair."
3.0,Falt√≥ la faja
3.0,"Two major issues. These boots are extremely uncomfortable without adding an insert. Also, on my left boot, there was extra material below where the tongue was sewn to the boot that folded straight down and rubbed my toes. However, this couldn't be trimmed as the liner is sewn to the tongue right at the edge. I had to purchase fabric seam glue and glue that peice to the top. After these modifications, the boots are really good for what they cost. But as purchased, 3 stars at best."
3.0,"It was perfect length, but did NOT help in the chest area."
3.0,"I really like how these look but was very disappointed when the optician said they were made from a material that cannot be adjusted smaller. If you have a smaller head, it's doubtful these will fit well."
3.0,I liked the look of the tote. Looks more expensive than they are. Both bags had mold on the leather and have a musty smell. I remove the mold still working on the smell.
3.0,"I ended up giving these to my niece...I am 5' 115lbs with a muscular build..these were always baggy and just didn't look ""good"". The quality is alright but I think you need a little more height and weight to make these fit comfortably and to look attractive"
3.0,This is super cute but it's obviously very cheaply made.... which is what you expect when you pay $6 for a swim suit. ( The leg holes aren't the same size.) It does cover pretty well because it has a high waist.
3.0,Wish there was a better size selection. I returned this item. Quality was nice but a bit sheer.
3.0,"Runs small, but nice"
3.0,The material is lightweight a bit thin for the price.  I was expecting a much thicker material for the price.  It fits well and has stretch for comfort.
3.0,It did look very nice. It was just a little bulkier than expected
3.0,"The color wears off, very disappointing"
3.0,"The product seems fine.  Although it said it was shipped when I ordered it, it took a month or more to arrive.  A XXL was too small for normally a large or XL fit.  I was disappointed."
3.0,"Dress fits wonderfully, very cheap feeling fabric though."
3.0,"The material is thinner and slinkier than I expected.  Also, the skirt portion is much less full than it appears in the product images.  I prefer my dresses with full skirts, so this was a large disappointment.  Otherwise, the color is nice, the skirt has a great length (almost to the floor on my 5'0&#34; frame), and the smocking has a good tension which makes the dress fit well at the torso."
3.0,Ice suit for price. Definatly not for the busty girls such as myself-42H I am a size 22 at Lane Bryant. This suit fits like maybe an 18-20 and pulls down on your chest.
3.0,I like it. But I ordered a mustard yellow. I got a very bright yellow. Thought it'd be thicker. And was a bit tight in the sleeves.
3.0,"Leg warmers are fine but not neon green in color, more of a bright dark green"
3.0,"The design is nice and the dress seems well-made. However, both fabrics feel cheap and rough/scratchy. Overall, I think it's what you'd expect for the price, but I wish the fabrics were better."
3.0,The fit on this hat is small..my head isn't that big and struggled to get it on.
3.0,"Bought for my daughter who is a 5‚Äô1‚Äù - the dress was short but not obscene for a 20 year old. This would be very short on a woman who is regular - tall.<br />Sleeves were cut longer and wider than expected for the size, returned because they looked weirdly baggy even though the rest of the dress was a good fit."
3.0,"better than no vision aids. Don't help on rural roads with little oncoming traffic, useful around town/city, heavily traveled streets/roads. didn't help me much so I gave them to a friend. He said they are VERY useful, he's an OTR truck drive on I80 over the Sierras, w/ lots of night time driving."
3.0,This ring is beautiful but maybe the size is off... and they dont have half sizes so maybe a smaller size seems to small to get..
3.0,it's ok....
3.0,Pretty item but the first one I received was broken. I ended up using something else but I had it clipped for the image. It would have been great if I didn't get a defective one!
3.0,I bought this for layering in the fall and winter months but the armholes are so fitted that I am not able to wear anything with sleeves underneath. Will have to return it.
3.0,"A pretty funny stocking stuffer for my husband. :) I can't speak personally to their quality but he felt they were a little too warm, even in the winter."
3.0,They suit the purpose but 1 of the 2 is always slipping off my foot.  I have to fix at least 5 times a day.
3.0,I thought this watch band was very small and would not buy again.
3.0,"Boy, the other reviews weren‚Äôt kidding. I ordered a full size larger and still have to return them. I can barely cram my foot inside.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not just that they run WAY small, but that the bridge just in front of the laces is very short so they are pressing down on the top of my foot even when unlaced. To fit insoles I‚Äôd have to order so large that they‚Äôd be huge in the toe just to be correct elsewhere, and they NEED insoles, they are rock hard inside. Absolutely no padding or support. Seems like a kinda bad design more than just being small. Major elements are wrong and these are painful to put on."
3.0,"Cute pattern, but socks are very thin."
3.0,Found this blouse to be bigger than expected
3.0,super thin... have to have a very thin body or not care of any imperfections to pull this dress off...
3.0,The bottom part of this in the front isn‚Äôt long enough for my taste
3.0,"The quality was not as good as I had hoped for, but then, they don't charge much either."
3.0,"These flip-flop slippers are very soft, as anticipated, but there is very little cushioning. I expect the cushioning of any slippers,to flatten out after I've worn them several times, but these had very little to begin with. I have some flip-flop slippers that were half as expensive that have much more cushioned soles."
3.0,Hat is great but it was weeks LATE
3.0,Lacing seemed a little too low on the shoulder to me. Lacing also far apart so probably wouldn‚Äôt wear with a bra.
3.0,The dress is pretty but the buttons on the back are very small.  The dress I received the buttons didn't line up exactly with the fasteners so it looked a bit bunched up.  I also am bigger busted and it was very tight across the chest.
3.0,not loose fitting enough to be true size. For leggings.
3.0,Very fashionable hat. However the medium was too big for my head by a very small amount and I am guessing the small would be too small. I will have to just go with my good ol' fashioned baseball cap.
3.0,Not as pictured. I received a different belt.
3.0,"Way to small, and product took over a month To get here."
3.0,"Quality seems a bit subpar, they are polarized and block out the sun as intended. I've had to buy multiple pairs because they're break and lenses scratch easily. You get what you pay for..."
3.0,It‚Äôs just beautiful!!<br />I guess by accident I ordered 2 of them .<br />One broke just when I was trying it on ugh !!<br />So disappointed!!<br />I have the other one though .<br />I like to return the one that‚Äôs broken .
3.0,"No longer to use, it was big"
3.0,Needed a little trial and error to get the hang of it.  Not sure it will work with smaller jewelry.
3.0,"It‚Äôs a very good bargain for a hard to find IWC type clasp.  However, I think this will only work if you have a very short buckle side of the strap.  Otherwise the inside part of the clasp when folded can be at an angle that doesn‚Äôt match with the curve of your wrist.  This forces the strap to bulge out and put pressure on the corner of your wrist.  It‚Äôs awkward.  The inside folding part of the clasp has to be much shorter to fit most straps.  This may only work with IWC OEM straps otherwise."
3.0,Very pretty except I had it on for an hour and it started falling apart.
3.0,"I got this for my friend and she loved it. Unfortunately, the eyes started popping out one week after."
3.0,"This is a nice looking band with a solid feel. It comes with the tools required to remove links to size, which is easy to do. The Blaze clips in nicely and the band really dresses it up. It would get a five star rating except the clasp mechanism comes apart too easily while you are wearing it"
3.0,"Very pretty, but I was hoping for something at or below the knee. Also the opening for my arms was wide enough to show bra, so doesn't quite work for me. Fit well and looked pretty otherwise."
3.0,Perfect for a charm bracelet.
3.0,Item was too short in the leg length. Appreciate the no-hassle return process.
3.0,Fabric is very thin.
3.0,I am 160 5'7 I took a medium. Fits well. Material is stretchy but the neck part is way off....I had to give it away.the material is see through. If I knew before I wouldn't have both it
3.0,"Pattern isn't my favorite in person, good for a beach cover up"
3.0,It's good that it came with many because the eye holes vary in sizes summer too small for me to even put on it's so uncomfortable and somewhere good to wear.
3.0,It is bigger than I thought it would be and it is a little uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,the strings are not sewed on too great. i bought 6 and 3 of the strings came off :(<br /><br />and they were my favorite too... i asked for new ones and the seller wanted a picture (which i sent) plus wanted the tanks given back... too much of a hassle. i just threw them away!!!
3.0,"It's not bad shirt. Keeps me warm, but does itch here and there."
3.0,"Order a size up at least.  Dress came as pictured, the lace wasn't bad, but I found the waist to be too short; it didn't look right on me.  Returned."
3.0,"Its ok...It looks nice, but the sizing is way off. I ordered a 22/24 and it fits more like a 13/14.<br />The strange thing about this is I order a white one and a black one. The white one fits fine, but the black one is too small. The black one is going back."
3.0,"These earrings are nice and easy to put on and take off. They are comfortable enough to sleep in. The only problem is that the post part bends easy so take care when you take them apart, they can bend easy."
3.0,"Looks cute, unfortunately only the snow man one worked. Tried new batteries but no luck. Would have returned it but kids loved the one that was working."
3.0,These reading glasses are OK for the price.<br />Pros: very light and easy on the ears and nose; no frame to look over or under<br />Cons: they sit crooked on my nose (?); the frames are cheap in appearance
3.0,"Liked the fact that the beanie fit closer to the head than others, as it doesn't appear to get stretched out like I've experienced.  HOWEVER, the drawback is, it gave me a slight headache due to too much pressure around the temples, as I wear glasses.  Also, the battery life is disappointing, as it doesn't seem to provide the hrs of charge it claims to offer.  I guess this explains why the beanie was on sale to begin with."
3.0,"I like the hat very much, but was very disappointed that it is not really crushable without permanently creating creases-you-do-not-want. This meant on our recent trip abroad, the hat had to ride outside the luggage and carry-on, not so great on cramped plains"
3.0,would order in a larger size - was tighter than i expected
3.0,"The band was not what I expected, the quality does seem that good, and the color was cheap looking (rusty off colored)."
3.0,"In the picture it looks as though it has a nice seam to hold mask to face, but it is in reality just a piece of cloth.  It stays on the face ok, but I double it up and put the folded side on face.  Not sure if they were worth the $, but our 7year old likes them."
3.0,"I ordered an extra large and it was too  tight, waited a long time for time product only to be disappointed"
3.0,"too small, way too short would be cute for a teenage girl"
3.0,"Although the fit was fine, the ruffle on the neck looked horrible! The fabric is very thin, and the neck just rolled and looked stretched out. Looks very cheaply made."
3.0,It is pretty but barely goes around my shoulders is deceptive. I am 5.1 and weight 120lbs.
3.0,Nice looking but runs small. The sweater is thin.
3.0,expensive for what it is... a sun hat that won't stay on your head in the slightest bit of wind.
3.0,"Pretty enough,  doesn't look real, but didn't expect t to with a stone this size."
3.0,"Very short - Almost mid thigh, and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äò4‚Äù. The material stretched very tight across my chest (38 DD), and it became see through. The waist band was right underneath my chest. Sleeves are nice, but the dress is so short, the ruffles on the sleeves and the flare on the shirt dress add size to my frame."
3.0,"It was okay! I got it to wear in hot weather though and didn‚Äôt really realize it was such a thick material. I also thought it would be a genuine wrap dress, but it is not. Lined really well and seems like good quality."
3.0,These are so cute. I got purple ones and I love them. Good product for a deal.
3.0,The button/rivet came off the second time I wore them. It left a hole where the rivet was but I sowed that up and then put a regular button on. Works fine now.
3.0,"I bought this dress because it looks super cute on the girl in the picture. It's pretty much the same in person but it's a bit larger than I expected. It fits. it's just a little loose around the waist and since this dress isn't particularly stunning, I was really just hoping for a tight fit. The shape of the dress is what I find pretty in the picture. Not sure if I'll keep it. Good quality, just not really a 'special' dress."
3.0,Too tight of a fit.
3.0,Not made very well started to come loose at the seems after 2 washes.
3.0,"I wear a size 12 shoe.  Although these slide in slippers were marked 12, they looked like about a size 10.  Returned immediately to Amazon."
3.0,"This shirt is cute enough I guess‚Ä¶ It just doesn‚Äôt fit like how you expect it to. I am 5 foot to 155 pounds and I got the extra small and even that doesn‚Äôt really fit in a very flattering way, because it is too large. Definitely want to size down with this top."
3.0,It was a bit big got size small
3.0,"THE TRIMMING AROUND THE 'N' DOES NOT GLOW, WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING."
3.0,Neckline hits really high making this uncomfortable when the arm holes are so open. It should have a more symmetrical feel but just feels awkward on me.
3.0,Does not tolerate the weight of the purses it can hold
3.0,"The hat is definitely nice, but the one I received did not have the U.S. Army Emblem on the side which was one of the reasons I purchased the hat in the first place."
3.0,Okay scrubs for the price. Other reviews said fits on small side so I ordered a medium. Big mistake they are huge.
3.0,"Fits as expected, I just wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the fabric or actual style. Mine was not soft at all, more of a harsh feeling material. I wore a couple of times but then donated it as I just didn‚Äôt care for it. I dont feel like it looks as pictured"
3.0,no place to hold paper money  and not enough credit card slots
3.0,Really like the design of the shirt but expected better quality material.
3.0,The style is really cute but unfortunately it was too big on me. For reference I am 5'7'' 115 pounds. It was too wide on the hips. Regrettably have to return.
3.0,"This is a typical wrap blouse, so I disagree with all the previous reviews that say the cut is low. It's exactly where it should be. I loved the colors, and I'm keeping the blouse, but the fabric feels a bit too polyester-y."
3.0,"They fit nice, they are comfortable, but certain parts of the lenses are blurry when you look."
3.0,not what I expected...thought it would be more of a workout pant.
3.0,This is a bowtie that you can successfully wear to black tie events a couple times before you realize that there's better bowties out there.
3.0,Larger than expected way too big for my surface 3
3.0,"This is a stretchy breathable material that is similar to the types of athletic shirts that wick away sweat.  3 stars because it wasn't what I had expected, but it fits and works fine.  Barely long enough to wear with leggings, but I don't wear it away from home anyway so it's fine.  I bought the white in a Medium.  I'm usually a size 8."
3.0,These look adorable but feel like steel wool.
3.0,Sooo cute many compliments.<br />Ordered 12-18 months fits more on the 12 month side bought for my grand daughter shes on the slimmer side approximately 18 pounds 14mo<br />Only complaint is after first wash the seams were unraveling still could wear but i hung dried it<br />Wouldnt recommend machine drying or washing if u want multiple uses
3.0,Pretty thin! I think it will be okay with spanks under it and maybe a shrug or demon jacket. It was inexpensive so I can't complain too much. It works for a cute outfit....
3.0,I like.  Glitzy and tacky and perfect costume jewelry.
3.0,"This scarf is very cute and soft, just like the picture! However, there was an acidic scent to it that I couldn't get out, even with washing! It's been airing out now for a few days, I am hoping that it helps. It also wrinkles very easily when washing, although I have a steamer so that part is pretty easy to fix."
3.0,The bottom fits great but I have to wear a tank under it to cover top half
3.0,I loved it although it was cheap materials so I have a hole in the armpit I really don‚Äôt want to return it but I don‚Äôt have a choice it‚Äôs right where the seam is so overall I would say the quality is poor but the jacket was cute.
3.0,Looks nice but cheaply made broke a week of my wife wearing it
3.0,"This dress is adorable, but the waist is too high.  I am 5'8&#34; and the waist of the dress was about 2 inches higher than my waist.  Disappointed that I will have to return an otherwise very flattering, lovely dress."
3.0,Unfortunately I can‚Äôt operate my iPhone through the clear piece<br />Otherwise it‚Äôs a nice little bag with ample pockets
3.0,"It looked very nicely made, but within the first day it ripped in two spots. I will try to see it back."
3.0,"I can barely see clearly through them, mine were suppose to be rose gold."
3.0,"I loved the color and the style, however the dealbreaker for me was the material and the fit around the neck. It was somewhat itchy and scratchy with the neck being a tad suffocating (to me), I‚Äôm steering away from this neck-style from now on."
3.0,"It‚Äôs cute for pictures, but was WAY too short. The straps kept falling off her shoulders so I cross crossed them and that helped. She had to wear shorts under this."
3.0,Hard to get credit cards in and out of slots as it was too tight of a fit.  Had to return.
3.0,"I put 3 stars because they maybe work but I can't use them so don't know.  I ordered a medium based on the recommendation of my shoe size (women's 8 1/2) and they were way too big - I would have to cut down about 1/2"" below the limit.  A bummer because they took a long time to come but I will order in a small and cross my fingers that they work out!"
3.0,"I use them in the yard to - they are cute!<br /><br />I changed my mind, after washing the item it is starting to fray."
3.0,"Bought these for a Trunk or Treat display, which worked out perfectly. However, I definitely DON'T recommend these if you wanted to actually wear them. They are made very cheaply and offer zero support. It would be like putting a plastic bag on your feet with straps."
3.0,"Only for costume purposes. My daughters height is about 5'5&#34;...so it fit her well, anyone taller than that will not be happy."
3.0,Cute but needs longer laces.
3.0,It is ok not as faltering as I thought
3.0,Cheap fabric.  Not as durable as I had hoped.
3.0,Like the styles however the were to small ordered by waist size displayed and they did not fit my husband.
3.0,"Chain sucked, charmed pretty good"
3.0,Material is very stiff
3.0,Had a hole in the sleeve
3.0,The bracelet is very pretty. Looks great on. I only gave it a 3 due to the fact the button that fastens it came off the first time I wore it. I was able to rethread and attach.
3.0,"I should have gotten it one size smaller... The other one I got was tight on my arms... And I thought, this would be great if it was a pinch larger. The next size was an entire size larger..."
3.0,Runs a bit small!
3.0,"It came with a hole in it,  right at the seam under the arm. Very undatisfied.<br /><br />*Update*<br />The seller contacted me immediately & sent me a replacement.  They were very polite & quick to respond every time I emailed.<br />That being said,  the material is definitely not Chiffon.  It says 100% Polyester right one the tag.<br />It's nice looking & will still come in handy at the beach.  I'll update my review when I actually fyi to the beach with it."
3.0,I like the bracelet but it was a little large for my wrist.
3.0,"The watch bands fit nicely, are durable, and comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the ""red"" watch band I received did not match the color from the listing. The band I received is a neon pinkish color. The ""green"" band did match the one listed."
3.0,had to buy another the string broke
3.0,to shinney
3.0,Pretty but didn't stretch
3.0,"Material is nice, tank is super cute. Can't give 5 stars because the sizing is off. I wear between an xl and xxl, so I opted for the bigger one. It's super tight. üòî"
3.0,I really liked this dress but it comes too short. You couldn't wear this to work and I wouldn't even feel comfortable wearing this out of the house.
3.0,"The idea of this bralette is nice.  The execution is a little off...the straps at the back of the bra is set wide off towards the underarms.  I find I am constantly fussing with the straps.  The sizing is also a bit confusing.  where 3x might be considered huge, the sizing chart might indicate that this would fit an American size 14-16.  So Just be aware of that.  What I love is the material. It is thick and otherwise well constructed. Like other reviewers, I find the insert pad odd; it's a uni-pad.  Weird!.  Most of the time I just remove them and keep on keeping on.  The bra does roll up/ride up as you bend and move around.  This is little annoying, but after awhile I tend to forget about it.  They are good for casual light support and can be worn like a camisole."
3.0,Function is too complex
3.0,the armholes are somwhat tight. otherwise looks good..
3.0,They are ok but very small . They slip down in the pocket and cannot be seen.
3.0,I love how big they are but the hair bows are very weak and does not last long so 3 stars
3.0,Too big but I loved the stones
3.0,A pretty earring but a little too dainty.
3.0,Attractive but just a bit too small for my head. With the right clothes this makes a stylish fashion statement.<br /><br /> Seller provides quality care and excellent service.  I've purchased quite a few hats from their store.  Quite satisfied overall particularly their responsiveness to their client's needs.  Happy Holidays to you and yours!
3.0,the string that is Stiched up with breaks fast had to fix it with another once since it came off
3.0,"Fit great on top , but was Too short in back."
3.0,Pretty cute. Not the best quality fabrics. Keeping because style is cute. Cute kind of high between the thighs though
3.0,"ordered by the colors that were shown, but IT IS NOT PEACH AND BLUE, it is red and blue.  Beautiful, heavy and will wear, but it does not go with what I bought it to go with.  Change your picture, or tell exactly what the colors are."
3.0,Neck lining peeled off the first day I wore it
3.0,"These fit ok, but they are not very sticky at all, so they ended up falling off."
3.0,"Pretty shirt but with several reviews stating it fit small, I ordered up. I found the fit to be roomy in general with looser sleeves than I would have expected, even with ordering up a size."
3.0,"Was looking for something bigger.  Earrings are tiny.  Quality good, but was looking for something more substantial."
3.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; 128lbs, ordered medium, it too big, but still cute"
3.0,"I use adhesive bras all the time. I like to wear strappy dresses often and hate bra straps showing, or the top of bras being visible. This is a great tool for women!<br />A lot of the ones I've used have been the cloth type, but I've come to like the gel ones better. When you're wearing them, it hardly looks like you're wearing a bra at all. They keep the shape of your breasts well and don't make them looked smushed down. There's a nice curve to them; shirts and dresses drape really well. Plus they feel better to touch.<br />The entire back side of these are adhesive and I would suggest saving the plastic bit that goes over it so you can keep it clean and wear it again. I have small breasts that are farther apart from eachother and have a hard time finding bras that will flatter them. I've been able to wear this a couple times and the adhesive has stayed pretty well. I'll wear it until it starts peeling because they'll stay sticky a long time.<br />These are hard to find the perfect spot to stick them though. Ive found that the top will dig into my skin and give the appearance that I'm wearing a bra that's too small for me so I end up trying to cover the whole breast (which isn't hard for me because they're tiny) instead of just cupping the bottom. But then it doesn't work well for low cut dresses or the likes and there's only a few shirts which cut out backs that I'll use these with<br />They are a little most difficult to wear when you're sweaty. The sweat gets trapped and can start making it uncomfortable and easy to peel off.<br />I do use this, but not as often as I'd like. I have others that work much better and this is mostly a back up or just worn with certain shirts<br />I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion"
3.0,Fits fairly loose at sleeves and waist. Cute! But kinda loose.
3.0,"Cute socks. Bows not seen well,  several came off after first wear."
3.0,"If you're wearing this out or around people, you'll want to wear a tank top or camisole of some sort to hide the girlie jewels."
3.0,The material of leotard is good but the skirt gets runs really easy which is my main issue with this one.
3.0,The hoodie was heavy which I wanted but it fit kind of snug. Afraid of shrinkage.
3.0,"Runs small, too small for me, otherwise seems like a great product.  The fabric looks sturdy and feels nice. They're just too small for me to even try to wear."
3.0,The eye itself doesn‚Äôt look good.
3.0,"The top is cute, but the bottoms DO NOT match the top at all.  I am using the top with another swim diaper that I already have.  There is no turquoise color in the bottoms and headband.  They are also useless since they would not even cover up a disposable swim diaper.  But for the price, I went ahead and kept it knowing that I would only have my daughter wear the top."
3.0,"Cute design, mediocre fabric. Not what I'd call great, but not omg what did I buy cheap either.  The lace is soft, and the length is right, but it runs small (cant have much of a chest especially if you're already bigger everywhere else) and you can't fluff very much with petticoats because of the way it's sewn.  The picture is significant fluffier than what is accomplishable. But if you just want something ruffley then this is a nice addition to the closet.  And it's very memorable.  Went to a restaurant with a friend a month later the waiter remembered my dress."
3.0,"Bought this for my BF.  Within 5 minutes, it fell of because the clasp is so cheap.  It is cool looking, but he won't wear it d/t the hassle of making sure it stays on his arm."
3.0,It's a really cute cowgirl hat. Pretty sturdy. However due to the stiffness and sturdiness of the straw it does not stay on my head. It slowly rises over time and always needs to be pushed back upon the head.
3.0,All the buttons have come off the backs. Now just looks like a basic lace up. Not horrible but I liked the gold accent of the buttons.
3.0,"Nice product, however the toes could use more reinforcement.  Even with toenails clipped short, one socket has a hole in the toe after only two wearing.  Perhaps only to be worn when one does not have to walk much."
3.0,The sweater is soft and fits well
3.0,Very pretty. But broke in first wearing.
3.0,"Are as described, and daughter wanted to keep, but was disappointed as we ordered the black/pink combo and got what was pictured.  The label actually says black/pink, but as you can see that's not what we received..."
3.0,A little tight.  This swimsuit started fading within 3 weeks of wearing it.  That is the only teadon I gave a 3 star
3.0,Great price and really pretty stones but the mountings were so flimsy they bent when I put them on!
3.0,Hole in bottom
3.0,"these are comfortable, and I love the variety of patterns. However, they do run a bit small for being a size Large."
3.0,"It's a bracelet but it runs really small, so if your wrist is larger it more than likely won't work. I got it for a friend as a gift and I hope it will fit her."
3.0,Hard to determine what your size is because the size chart makes no sense. EXTRA large fits like a 2X. And then there is a random button on the crotch area but it has no opening so it‚Äôs a little strange but other than that cute and light weight. Going to get a smaller size!
3.0,Hook bent easily just putting it in my ear.
3.0,Was nice but wrong size was sent
3.0,Its too big for my head..  None the less cool product wish they made it a tad bit smaller
3.0,We loved the dress but it was too short for my daughter to wear
3.0,"I really don't like to give reviews but I must post this one, I was not impressed with this product, it is cheaply made and the material is not what I expected."
3.0,It's pink and the material feels like 99% polyester Now I'm kinda stuck wearing it as I don't have time for anything else to be here in time for the 4th
3.0,These have a very low rise.  I suppose it is because it is based on sizing in China.  I do like the stripes though.  They are cute to wear and look at.
3.0,"Wayyy longer than described/pictured/described by other reviewers. Did they change the length in response to reviews or is this a defective batch? Good thing I can return it for free, but question is if i reorder it will I get the correct length? It‚Äôs cute otherwise."
3.0,It looked nice I wish it would have showed up before the holidays!
3.0,"I am a size 8 all day, every day. The bottoms are tight in the waist and the top is shorter than it looks. Not an attractive lookü§≠"
3.0,"They‚Äôre cute but the sewing is a bit odd and if you have hips or curves at all, it‚Äôs squeezes in some places and just hangs in others."
3.0,Seams rip easily
3.0,Pretty but the product is really cheap
3.0,Way too short on the length athough not exposing my waist I would really like it longer to near hips
3.0,Not as cute as I had hoped. Definitely on the smaller side and looks weird on. Good for just hanging around the house.
3.0,The red is more of a coral color.
3.0,"Nice length and shade of pink.  But it does wrinkle a bit in the dryer, which was unexpected for that material."
3.0,Pink beads are very small and a very very light pink...not as pictured.<br />White beads are larger and as pictured.
3.0,I was expecting a heart shaped charm as it was pictured but it is perfectly round and much more bead shaped. It's acceptable as it is.
3.0,Super cute but very small. I even sized up to a large. Sleeves  fit losely and chest fits ok but it‚Äôs short(right at button of pants) and like a T-shirt fit for the rest. Will be returning
3.0,"It's a gr8 idea, they just did the very minimum... I hope the next version is much better quality... but the hat is gr8!"
3.0,"Band quality is okay, but the color doesn't match the Garmin Vivoactive 4s. Color is more of a hot pink'"
3.0,Bought this as a gift for my niece for Christmas. The fit was perfect but the design on the front was way more faded then the look you see in the photo. She still loved it.
3.0,"These look great and I'd love to wear them.  Maybe I'm a baby, but my ears ache if I wear them for longer than an hour, so... I never wear them."
3.0,"Lo utilize  para crocs  y lucen bien pero se despegaron, caros.  la calidad no es buena"
3.0,"This shirt is good quality and I do like it. I ordered an XL and my only complaint is the armpits. The fabric sags there, but you can't notice unless I lift my arms up. (And I don't think sizing down would have helped because I have a DD chest.) I still plan on keeping it for a comfy shirt to wear on a casual day, but because of the weird fit on my body type, it probably won't be a favorite."
3.0,It's definitely more like a long sleeve shirt with pocket. A lot thinner than I thought. I bought a 2X and really wish there was bigger sizes because I believe a size or two up would have fit me way better. Definitely fits tight and won't be able to dry.
3.0,Funky eye fit and i have small eyes. Had to cut it in some places.
3.0,Only 2 out of 4 are actually good. The EPCOT ball and Hollywood Tower ones are the only good ones. They are very bright and well done. The animal kingdom one is way too dark and the castle is way to low on the mask so you cant see most of it as it goes under your chin. The straps are also all unevenly sewed. One side is longer and other side is shorter on some and just not all the same length to stretch to your ears to where they don‚Äôt look like they are being pulled forward. All are pretty uncomfortable. I feel like I wasted my money. Quite disappointed.
3.0,"It's a whistle. It's also a keychain. It goes 'woooooooot' and it's pretty loud. It's also dirt cheap. Fit and finish is meh, but it still makes noise and weighs virtually nothing. If you want better fit and finish then buy the titanium version from nitecore, which is about 18 bucks. If you're ok with this aluminum version that is going to get beat up by your keys anyway, buy this whistle."
3.0,"My preteen daughter is shaped like a box, not like a Barbie.  It is too tight and uncomfortable in the middle/torso area."
3.0,"I've been trying to find a hoodie to wear to a game and unfortunately, this is is not it.  Material is thin, which I expected, but it feels cheap and the cut is odd.  The pocket placement is very low and extremely wide, to the point of making the pocket non-functional.  The sleeve length is nice, as it is long.  Overall, the item is priced much higher than the quality of the product.  If the Dollar General sold clothes, this would be there.  Disappointed."
3.0,Works as it should for a kids watch. Cant cumplain
3.0,"Really difficult to open up, I bought it for my mom but I‚Äôm unsure she‚Äôll even be able to open it up. Also it doesn‚Äôt come with anything to cover the photos but I guess you could just cut out some clear film. Not really sure how they stay in the holes either but I guess I‚Äôll know when/if we use them eventually."
3.0,Only wore these 2 times and after washing them and hanging them to dry i noticed that the stitching was coming apart and the fabric is not sweats material its some really thin fabric. Right on for their sizing though. Just wish they were a better quality.
3.0,It came with a crystal missing.
3.0,"This item would have been perfect for me, but was returned due to the fact it was folded into a small box. It was wrinkled to the extent of not being able to wear."
3.0,These certainly are NOT easy-on or easy-off. I have to do a Tarzan yell to get them in my elderly mother. She winces with discomfort as I struggle to get them on her.
3.0,Sister loved it! Its not the best material but you're it's not terrible
3.0,the Brand Military Royale Swiss Style Mens Black Stainless Steel White Numeral for the money its ok. light. works. no problen setting date and hour. silent.
3.0,"Bought this specifically because I wanted a bracelet sized key chain I can throw on my wrist If I have to run into the store with no purse. Doesn‚Äôt come close to fitting over my wrist and doesn‚Äôt even fit over my 7 year old son‚Äôs wrist. Not terrible quality. The keychains themselves seem durable, but this isn‚Äôt it if you‚Äôre looking for a bracelet sized keychain."
3.0,"it's actually a very beautiful peace and I love it, unfortunately, the chain isn't very strong and snapped upon the first time I wore it. I plan to keep it and replace the chain when I have some time.<br /><br />Honestly, the chain was the only problem, if it wasn't for that little problem then I would have given this a perfect review."
3.0,"very shiny fabric, and fit ended up baggy in knees."
3.0,I bought this braclet for my daughter but didn't end up giving it to her because it was way too big and didn't have a way to size it down.  Just be aware that it is adult size and might not work for children or smaller individuals.
3.0,Not my favorite shirt but I still wear it.
3.0,There was no washing instructions so I was it with other items made fro same type fabric.  All of the new PJs faded!  Still soft but ugly.
3.0,"Not well made and not cotton. I bought a size up because others said it ran small, but when I ordered up, it was too big. I sent it back and don't plan to order in the smaller size because the fabric was not what I expected."
3.0,"Very cute sandal, easy to put on. Giving it 3 starts because we used it on 10 occasions max throughout the summer and the Velcro strap detached from one of the sides."
3.0,"It looks very similar to the photos shown except they should cut the lace pieces that are sewn all throuout the veil much much better. It also looks like there is some pieces that were scraps sewn in which made it look cheap if anyone really looked or paid attention to detail (which I do). Overall, it is a beautiful veil and was great for my pre wedding shoot."
3.0,Colors look completely different than in photo
3.0,They're decent but not worth the price in my opinion.
3.0,Great material great item but it runs small
3.0,Fit was good but it came ripped. Didn't love it enough to get another. it is a bit on the tighter side.
3.0,"I bought these shoes for my son to attend a family member's funeral. It arrived two days before the funeral, which was great. I bought a size 5.5 - his shoe size; however, it was too big. I was very disappointed because I had to run to the store the following day to buy another pair of shoes. I am not returning it because the shoes are really cute and my son will grow into it soon. I recommend getting a half size smaller because it runs large."
3.0,Not near as fleecy and plush as I thought but I had no time to reorder another elsewhere. Rather thin.
3.0,"Love the top, i read that the bottom is supposedly a brazilian bikini, definitely not.. covers entire bottom. Love the top though"
3.0,"Cheap, crap"
3.0,"It‚Äôs only the top, the picture is deceiving"
3.0,Soft and comfortable but the sides are uneven and kind of stick out.  It's fine but I won't be wearing it infront of anyone.
3.0,Pretty but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 about 127 lb and Med was way too big.
3.0,"The material in this top is thin, I can tell it will pill easily."
3.0,The hook clasp is very difficult to work.
3.0,Smaller than I had wanted
3.0,I did like the pattern and color for my husband but they run really small and he can‚Äôt fit them.
3.0,The shirt material is great. It's thick and nice. The size is a bit tighter than I expected.
3.0,"-fabric not comfortable, feels almost paper-like..<br />-quick & easy to install & remove"
3.0,"This is a cute hat, but it was waaay big for my small face. With the brim down it just about covered my eyes.  Even though I returned it I gave 3 stars for quality, softness and fashionability. If it had run smaller I would have kept it for sure.  BTW I tried the inside ribbon adjuster, but although it made it a tighter fit it didn‚Äôt  change the oversized look."
3.0,"Bargain that‚Äôs very pretty to wear, but the clasp is tough to open when trying to insert your sweater."
3.0,Ordered a large and was sized as a small
3.0,"I bought these and deconstructed them to make my own personalized earrings. For the price, this is a good deal. Worn as is shipped, very cheap fastenings. The feathers are cool tho if you want to buy them for just that."
3.0,It fits as expected but Its to long. Still very beautiful.
3.0,Looks cute but a little weird on the size
3.0,"This bag will definitely make a nice weekend bag. It has lots of compartments so small items are easy to find/reach. The leather smell is evident but I love the smell of leather so that's not a problem for me (I just mentioned it for those of you who don't like the smell).<br /><br />Now for the reason it lost two stars...<br />I ordered the silver grey however the bag actually looks more bronze gold. (See photos - I took them with flash and without) I was really looking forward to the silver grey colour since that's my favourite accessory colour.<br /><br />Updated February 19, 2017<br />I've added some pictures to show all the compartments on the inside of bag."
3.0,This does not have nearly enough compression as most ab boards. I‚Äôm gonna send mine back and use the ones I have.
3.0,"I bought this to go on a sailing trip and I had to hold it on with my hands to avoid having it fly away. It is very flimsy and not good to wear if it is windy. It does not have any to tie it around your next. There is a tie to tighten it around you head however, the wind can still blow it away."
3.0,"Years ago, I owned some cross trainer sneakers that had blue gel-like cushions that purported to add spring during activities. It was minimal, but I did feel that it added to comfort and some 'bounce back' when running or playing sports. I mention this because these inserts have a similar feature embedded into their shoe insert. The blue area (round on top and rectangular on bottom of sole insert) is this specific feature. Today's walk, I cannot say if it was totally effective, but if it's anywhere close to those sneakers, the added bounce will be appreciated.<br />The insert has a guide that allow you to cut them to custom fit. I would advise cutting larger than expected, and then trim accordingly. This takes a little more time, but better to take time, and gradually fit them to your shoe/foot, than to discover you cut them too short.<br />These inserts seem to be of average thickness and stiffer than your run of the mill shoe insert cushion. The thought behind this is that bounce back aspect. The gray areas of the insert is to provide some cushioning, but also rebounds as you step into it during activity. The blue area having more of the squishy rebound effect. So, if you are looking for a soft cushion to allow you walk on clouds, this is not the insert you seek.<br />This insert does not have any arch support. I think arch support is the leading contributor to foot fatigue. So, the absence of any support is disappointing. But, based on the product details, this feature was not expected.<br />Overall, it is a decent shoe insert, with ""Bounce"" technology as it's differentiating feature.<br />Photos are provided to give some real world images of the inserts, the sizing guides and the blue bounce ares.<br />I give this product a medium level of recommendation."
3.0,The image was a little pixely and the H was missing a chunk of pigment. Not worth the price but it was more of a gag gift for my boss at Hardee‚Äôs who is pregnant. She said this is the first outfit she‚Äôs received for the baby so I wish it had been better. She still loves it and she almost cried when she saw it. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again but I‚Äôm glad I did this time
3.0,The pattern in the back is just cut out. It looks cheap. Also (and this is my fault) when I see the word T-shirt I am thinking cotton. I did not read that is is polyester and spandex so be warned.
3.0,I guess I thought the would be bigger or a lil more round. Nonetheless I'm keeping them!! Not sure if I love or could send back...
3.0,"Very cute. Light weight. Not to keen on the material though. Hot. Color red is more orangey. If ordered in blue & a M instead of a L, I'd keep it. Returned."
3.0,"These are definitely ‚Äúmom‚Äù jeans and the style is so cute. Sadly, the fit is way off. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 195lbs. I wear a size 12. I ordered an XL. They would not fit over my ‚Äúmom‚Äù hips. If you have hips then definitely order a size up. The sizing is way off. However, the jeans themselves are a good quality."
3.0,Very cheap looking and not what I expected. I had to fix it with my sewing machine
3.0,Expensive and didn't have Olympic logo on it
3.0,It's got thick fabric but the zipper is absolutely crap. Breaks all the time.
3.0,"Polyester. Cute, I just don‚Äôt like the material. Bought for my daughter. It‚Äôs big on her but we cross the straps in the back and it worked for her. She liked it so I didn‚Äôt return it. I would not have kept it for myself."
3.0,"I really like the color, but it was just a bit shorter than I wear my dresses."
3.0,"The cut of the bib along with the suction cups and the strap is life changing especially if you are BLW! Unfortunately due to the material, it does not clean well and ends up with mould or a very unpleasant odor unless washed in the machine. Very unfortunate especially considering the price point."
3.0,Slow shipping from China. 4 weeks. Buy in advance. Products looks ok but is very lite. purchased as gift so haven't tried it out.
3.0,got what paid for
3.0,"After noting what other reviewers were saying, I decided to purchase a 2x size dress (I'm either a large or XL or size 16).  The dress fit...zipped it no problem.  But I have a large bust, and that pushes out the bodice of the dress, which then makes the bodice too short, so that the waist of the dress was forced up to just below my bustline.  It isn't the most flattering look.  Removing the belt helped the appearance a tiny bit.  But I love the skirt of the dress, especially because I wore a crinoline that poofed it out.  I felt so girly.  And yet also so fat... Hmm... :("
3.0,"I wanted to love it, but the size does run small. Material is thin and the buttons are flimsy. Looks really pretty in person. I recommend sizing up on this top. Returning it today."
3.0,"Sent back, not great quality"
3.0,Still cute in real life but the plastic is so thin I think you could puncture it with a straw.
3.0,We purchased these and i absolutely loved them but the backs already fell off within two days. So that‚Äôs a bummer
3.0,Not sterling silver but cute.
3.0,Put them in wash with no soap at all after one wash color faded completely you can still make out the pattern but definitely faded
3.0,Got my dress with a rip at the bottom. I have to return . Thank God I had something else to wear for my date.
3.0,Didn‚Äôt like too short
3.0,For someone 5‚Äô2 I thought it was a bit short in the front.
3.0,This dress made me look pregnant. The top is nice and fitted but the waist is too big so the dress just hangs. I ordered a S and am a US size 4. It's also very long. I am 5'3 and the dress is mid-calf length on me.The dress may have worked if it had a self tie belt/straps. It's pretty though and good quality.
3.0,Took a long time to receive this item and the slippers ran large. They‚Äôre cute and they seem cushy for my toddler‚Äôs feet.
3.0,"I only got 14 pairs, I  am not pleased with this I paid full price for these items, i expected all 15 items, however, the company was nice and messaged me to correct my order so let's see"
3.0,"Cute, but the name print is smaller then it looks on line.."
3.0,"It's an  fit ok, but you can see through it!"
3.0,Product runs very small. If you have a large chest I do not suggest it.
3.0,"All in all, it‚Äôs a decent cape for the price. The one thing that made me rate it lower was that it leaves little fuzzies everywhere. I ordered a red cape to wear with a black dress as Little Red Riding Hood. By the end of the day, my black dress was covered in res fuzzies."
3.0,"The wallet does not have as many credit card pockets as I thought it would. It is a nice wallet, though, so now I am using two mwallets!"
3.0,I had gotten these for a gift for Mom but had to return<br />Didn't realize sizing was a bit confusing and they were mens sizing.
3.0,Ring detail is not as defined as appears in picture. Appears good quality and fits right.
3.0,It's fine but ought to be priced at 10 dollars and not 20.  I'll use it until I find a better one.
3.0,Beautiful product but it  DOES NOT come close to fitting a head that is a 37 or bigger.
3.0,"Cute shoes, but the description is wrong - I have these exact shoes and they are PU upper - these are TOTALLY NOT LEATHER!  I wear a size 8 - 8.5 in women's boots, and bought these in a size 6, and they fit great, maybe even loose, even with socks, so I would say they run a tad bit big.  Average- to good-quality, but not leather."
3.0,I‚Äôm honestly not sure how I feel about the fabric. It‚Äôs a weird slinky feeling unbreathable thing. It got as expected and does what it‚Äôs intended to do. It‚Äôs great for layering but I hate how the bottom of the shirt rides up.
3.0,"This is a lovely hoodie, but after one wash, in cold water, the colors faded."
3.0,made in china and feels like it too. it is stylish though.
3.0,"Is as described, but I don't care for the sleeves."
3.0,"I like the style and sewing is done well.  I find the fabric thin and not cozy warm.  I bought a size up to allow for shrinkage, but don‚Äôt see/ feel any change.  I prefer National brand women‚Äôs nightgowns although the styling is um, mid Twentieth Century."
3.0,Size problem
3.0,"Cool design but the neck stayed stretched out after one day wearing it, even after washing again, stayed stretched.  I do joy have a large head.  Would prefer a better quality shirt"
3.0,Ordered a women's size 10 and they run small.  Overall loved the look and feel of the boot.  Great quality but too small.  So I would recommend going up a size since they run small.
3.0,"I liked the fabric and shine, but the size run small. I'm a US size 12, I ordered a size large and I couldn't get my leggings over my thighs. If I were to reorder I'd order a size XX."
3.0,I would‚Äôve given it five stars but it was too small for the size I picked. It didn‚Äôt fit well at the waste.  First time I‚Äôve ever had this problem with ordering clothes from Amazon. I will try to return it. For the price everything else is fine.
3.0,"Okay for the price, not super fancy"
3.0,"Package arrived in plastic bag, no shoebox. When I opened the bag, a strong chemical smell came out. I hope that fades."
3.0,Thought these were for boys but there for girls
3.0,The metal hooks and attachment pieces press into your banjo when you're wearing it.
3.0,"*deep sigh* I SO wanted this shirt to work! For the price, I expected to be able to button it. Took it out the package and two buttons didn't have well cut holes to push it through. If you're short or heavy breasted, it will show your bra as well. Super cute though!"
3.0,"Image in white of rhino very thinly painted on, is flaking off already and I only tried it on! Very funny but cheaply made."
3.0,This outfit is adorable but does run a little small. I would size up
3.0,"The quality of the material is nice, but it‚Äôs not true to size. I normally wear a 1x but got a 2x because it‚Äôs shorter than I normally wear. It fits more like. Large."
3.0,It is brown with multi colored specs. Fits nice. Not what the pictur shows
3.0,Did not fit like the picture.
3.0,"Nice earrings, bit flimsy in the middle but overall it's pretty. Wish it came with little more sturdier backing"
3.0,Like fabric and color.  Nice design.
3.0,"These earrings are so lovely and well made. However, after wearing them for nine months, the posts tarnished and greatly irritated my ears. I even cleaned the posts multiple times hoping that would help my ears not be irritated, but it didn't work. If I wouldn't have worn the the same pair of earrings almost constantly, I'm sure the posts would have been just fine. That said, the manufacturer clearly states that they are stainless steel, hypoallergenic, and will not cause irritation‚Äîwhich is NOT how they worked for me. If you want to wear these earrings once in a while‚Äîor rotate through all of the pairs‚Äîthey will be fine for quite a while. But if you want daily earrings that you don't need to remove (which is what I wanted), I recommend different earrings that actually show the surgical stainless steel marking on the posts‚Äîwhich none of these earrings show."
3.0,Its really cute.... Except for the fact you co.oletely sent me a product with no arm buttons. I can believe I wasted 30 some dollars on a shirt I spent extra for on shipping and you couldn't get two frigging buttons on the one spot buttons are made to go. Now I get to find and buy new buttons and thread to fix this. Thanks. For nothing
3.0,Decent product but not really comfortable
3.0,This sandal would not buckle around my ankle at all. I wear a size 7 in other shoes and ordered a size 7 in this sandal. The length of the sandal was perfect for my foot it was the strap that wraps around the back of the ankle to fasten the shoe that was very short. I‚Äôm not sure if sizing up would fix it or if the actual sole would be too long on the foot. Very cute sandal though.
3.0,You can get these way cheaper and with a warranty if you buy from a real consultant. They‚Äôre only $35 brand new plus you can add your own personalization.
3.0,"This dress is pretty much just okay, but for the price I would say look elsewhere as it is not worth what I paid for. I was overall happy with the way the dress looked, however it does have its flaws. The length of it is okay, but the strange material that makes up the patterned bottom half of the dress causes it to ride up over time, this strange material also gives the dress this poof look which is also a bit odd and unnatural looking. As soon as I opened the package with the dress in it and went to unbutton the top of the dress the button fell off because it was held on by a thin string. It did the job for the wedding I was attending, but it really wasn't all I was expecting it to be."
3.0,"A little tight around the leg.  Bamboo socks are lightweight, soft, and comfortable."
3.0,Bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my mom.  Very pretty but EXTREMELY small.  Looks like it is made for a child's wrist not an adult's.  Now will have to purchase something else to go along with this in case it doesn't fit.
3.0,"I bought this looking for something different. It is really cute and same in person. For the price it's not that bad. It is a little big, but that is just on me. I am not to happy with the backing on it but like I said for the price is cute and worth it."
3.0,"came in wrong size, super sheer, very cheap"
3.0,Ordered this dress for my 7 year old niece. I ordered 11-12 and the dress was to small. It only went to her knees and the shoulder and arms were tight. The dress is really cute but way to small.... :(
3.0,"What I like most about this product is the style.  The round neck and 3/4 length sleeves look very elegant, but I was extremely disappointed with the use of the product's light, flimsy material.  I am returning it."
3.0,I really like the sexy look of this piece but not well-made.  I wore it once for about an hour around my house and after I took it off 2 links had disconnected.
3.0,"It's very tight on top unable to put it on, needs more space on top."
3.0,They are alright. On one pair it was two different colors. And a couple of the backs we're stripped and wouldn't screw in. Over all decent.
3.0,"This is a great looking bag, unfortunately I didn't look closely until a week after the 30day return expired. I found a small tear between the bottom leather stitching and the body of the bag. Should have been caught on a quality inspection. Otherwise a reasonably priced, good looking bag."
3.0,I have the silver one and got the gold one and this color is opaque gold it's not shinny like the silver one but I still like it because it's gold time.
3.0,Nice and not to thick but as you talk they ride down
3.0,"Great price, but make sure you are not allergic to rubber"
3.0,"Out of the 12 retainers in the package, 3 of them will not tighten up.  The hex screws just spin in the threaded holes.  Close inspection revealed that the threads in the stainless retainers were virtually non-existent on the 3 inoperative units.  Luckily, I needed exactly 9 -- the number which DID tighten up.  You might take the failure rate into consideration when ordering.  Of course, your mileage may vary..."
3.0,"I'm 5'15 ft, 110 lb. I bought size XS and it fits me perfectly! It's cute, even the fabric feel like rough, I am still satisfied with the price."
3.0,"The cuffed arms on this shirt were constricting. This shirt would have been great if there was stretch to the material. Otherwise, even though the shirt was oversized for me, I had trouble bringing both arms forward. The shirt was too large in the front, but it was too tight across the back."
3.0,It was nice. It didn't have the jewel in the middle of the cross like shown in picture.
3.0,"Kind of see-through, which I didn't expect, so definitely wearing a slim camisole under it. Like the length. Fast shipping."
3.0,The mask was fine but would be better if it came with an elastic band. It was difficult to put on which is why I am giving it 3 stars. The actual mask was a nice matte finish and the plastic was heavy duty
3.0,dress wasn't finished. pockets unsewn.  Very nice color.
3.0,When I open the bag I notice one of the jewels from the rigth side fall off.
3.0,Bracelet is nice but the clasp could be a little stronger.
3.0,runs small in the waist
3.0,Quality seemed good but sizing is off.
3.0,Not crazy about the print. It‚Äôs a lot more dull IRL and the fit around the bust was loose. I was very uncomfortable wearing it.
3.0,Pleased üëçüèª
3.0,"While I ordered a larger size the arm hole width does not match the size ordered, way too small. The overall size would be about 1-1/2 sizes smaller than what I ordered."
3.0,extremely thin and not real rhinestones just a print
3.0,"Nice, keepsake zipper pull!<br />Eyecatching, colorful hummingbird!!!<br />Love it!!!"
3.0,"Not grey, very much black"
3.0,I reeallly wanted to keep this but the way the top was cut made it impossible for the sleeves to stay up. It is super cute otherwise but if you have narrow shoulders then I don‚Äôt suggest this outfit for you.
3.0,"Cute dress overall, but the purple color is a lot darker than shown in the picture. I would recommend ordering a size larger than you usually wear as the fit is a bit snug. After reading other reviews and looking at the size guide, I was in between a small/medium. I ordered the medium and it was pretty snug in the chest area. Granted, I recently had a baby so my chest size fluctuates a bit‚Äîit definitely fit tighter by the end of the night. The fabric is nice and thick, but it was a bit wrinkly out of the package. Wore this dress for a Halloween costume, but could wear again for a special occasion/party."
3.0,"cute, but big"
3.0,"Pros:  color, fit, arrived on time, length was great, does not wrinkle much after washing and drying on warm<br />Con: the fabric is quite thin and light (could be a good thing in some climates?)<br />  the pin tucks in the design do not all lay down in one direction, some turn one way some the other"
3.0,"These are very light weight and dry quickly. However...if you sweat in the heat...it shows. They failed the ‚ÄòI look like I peed my pants‚Äô test.  It was rather embarrassing. I just had to hide from everyone after getting up from my camp chair, for about 10minutes until they dried out. They are comfy though."
3.0,"So the dress itself fit fine. Nothing special to it. Not sure how I feel about the top look. I also am not a fan of how you can see the under lining in the front. The material is a little thin so you can see your underwear line. Just okay for me.<br />Ordered a medium. 5‚Äô2, 148 lbs. 5 months pregnant."
3.0,"I'm pretty sure these things work. I put them in my suede shoes over night. I pull them out and they stink like feet, then I smell my shoes and they dot smell as bad. I think I my need a bigger size of these, or maybe just 2 per shoe"
3.0,"The location of the studs isn't centered so some of the earrings, like the elephant, can only be worn in one earlobe - otherwise in the other earlobe it is touching my face. Also, the stars are the same way. Two identical earrings, with the center stud on the same end of the curve, so when you put them in both ears, they both curve the same way - it's not symmetrical. If the studs were in the center this wouldn't happen, but otherwise, you can't wear certain sets as a pair, but rather just one at a time because of how they fit."
3.0,"very small, but cute"
3.0,It feels and works fine but not as good as original. Rough surface allows dirt to be collected on the band.
3.0,The look is amazing. However 1 of the clasps was broke upon arrival.<br />If it were not for that I would give it more stars.
3.0,The top was a completely different top then the one pictured.
3.0,"This mask works well for a base mask. Definitely didn't fit me well as I don't have a round head. It was tight around my cheeks and I had to cut the chin strap off. It does stretch over time so that's good. I am doing a distressed look so I am making more cuts in it which makes it more comfortable to wear. This mask definitely looks better if you work on it. The stitches are painted on with grey paint and the eye sockets were way too small compared to the mask in the movie. I painted the stitches white and fixed the eye sockets as it looks a lot better. Didn't like how it has the DC COMICS on the back of the mask instead of the inside of it. There's a opening on the back but I think i'll just sew it closed and make extra stitches. Like I said, it's not bad. It's a good working base, but you just have to make it better."
3.0,Order was not what I expected.
3.0,"I bought this for my wife asus smartwatch, it fits good, and is confortable. They only things that I would say is that the shipping takes longer tjat we were expecting. And the gold rose color, it was not really the exactly gold rose like the asus watch. The rest is good."
3.0,"Creative, YES, Attractive, and unique. However I think they were made for a Barbie doll. To small, for the average wrist. You've got to add more length and then you've got an excellent piece of jewelry."
3.0,It fits okay.  I will keep it.
3.0,"Unfortunately I need a vest with snaps. This vest has buttons, contrary to the item's description."
3.0,"It's a very beautiful dress, but the sleeves are itchy, and the zipper is hard to close. It also is extremely small."
3.0,I got this ring for my girlfriend because she really wanted a princess crown promise ring she loves it but only problem it turns skin green but she found a solution for it she put a coat of clear coat nail polish on the ring leaves a barrier for skin and ring
3.0,"The product itself is good, but even with measuring this is way too tight, I‚Äôve been consistently stretching it to see if I could make it better through wear and tear but it‚Äôs not really helping much."
3.0,"I love the print and for the price, expected the material to be as thin as it is. My problem with the size is that it is loose behind the knees and around the ankles so they don't look as awesome on because they are not perfectly form fitting. I haven't actually worn them yet because I'm still debating whether it's worth it to pay a seamstress to take the stitching in."
3.0,"The dress is a very pretty color. It was a bit larger, but still love it. Only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is the fringe is very delicate, and a couple frayed off already."
3.0,T Shirts were a bit on the small size.
3.0,"Its ok.. rather flimsy, my stuff slides under the  card that is on the bottom...maybe that was supposed to come out"
3.0,"Let me just say in honesty, you get what you pay for...I gave this to my nephew who wanted a pocket watch..He enjoys it.."
3.0,"I made the mistake of getting my size, the fleece inside these leggings take up a lot of space and I really should have gotten a size larger then usual, If you are on the ""edge"" get 2 sizes bigger. I managed to squeeze myself into the leggings for a few minutes and they are just as warm and comfortable as fleece can get! They do stretch a fair bit but its like wearing a girdle if you need more then a little stretch. Also, expect them to make you look 2 sizes bigger! Either way, if they would have fit me they would be a new favorite. I gave them 4 stars because of the fit, had I been wise enough to get a size larger then they would be 5 stars easy."
3.0,It's nice and iphone 7 plus fits well with very slim case BUT the strap clip does not work it cant be opened so I couldn't hook it onto the wallet.
3.0,I ordered a two of these shirts at a size 2X which the both fit perfectly. My husband threw the first one in the dryer and it shrunk so much that I can‚Äôt wear it anymore. The second one I washed and then hung up and it still shrunk! I can wear it but it‚Äôs a little too snug for my comfort. Definitely order a size up!
3.0,The bottoms worked great but the top ones wouldn't stay in my mouth even after molding them to my teeth
3.0,Product is as described.  Very light and very white.  Seems to wrinkle a bit easily but seems to straighten out while wearing.  Not sure it‚Äôs worth $85 dollars.
3.0,The band is shinny and new but even after one weeks wear the latch hole is wearing and I expect a shorter than desirable life....I am already looking for a replacement.
3.0,They were ok for the price a little bigger than I expected. Which would be ok if the finish of the gold wasn‚Äôt so shinny...
3.0,"They do the job or protecting your gave from the sun , but they are very  flimsy"
3.0,Sizing. The material is very nice
3.0,"I am on a search for ankle-length compression hose.  The first ones I tried, I chose by measuring the ankle, as directed.  When I saw my toes turning blue, I concluded that I had the wrong size.  Then I tried these.  The ankle felt fine, but the compression at the foot area was not sufficient.  Maybe this is because I have narrow feet."
3.0,A corkscrew was missing would like to get another one what to do
3.0,"I ordered them because of the reviews saying that that were good for people with larger breasts, like D or DD and I found that they revealed way too much side boob, that's just my experience though. I love the material, very soft, I would only be able to use them to sleep in though because there's just not enough material to cover a larger breasted person, and I'm only a 32-34 D to DD."
3.0,"The belly ring is cute, the egging stone fell out"
3.0,"The sizes are waaaaay off , I‚Äôm 5‚Äù6 155 pounds and size small was way to big .. the style of these pants aren‚Äôt thick , more like spandex leggings , which would be cute if they were sized correctly. These are super duper high waisted like super ... returned"
3.0,This is cute and flattering but it doesn't wash well. One washing and it fades and pills. If you just want something to wear around the house or for just one season it's fine
3.0,Kind of boxy and don't much care for the material.
3.0,I was so excited for this to come in the mail but I was not as pleased once I received. The material is like a cheap fleecy material and I was hoping it would be more lightweight for summer. The tie dye pattern is similar to the photo although looks a bit cheaper in person. I sized up and ordered a large as I like my loungewear with a little extra room and was pleased with how it fit. I will be keeping but I almost ordered another color and once it came I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt.
3.0,"Ordered a small based on size chart and other reviews.. it‚Äôs still too big (long) .. I‚Äôm<br />5‚Äô3‚Äù , 140lbs.. tried to return it.. as opposed to exchange due to not sure if smaller size world fit in chest area... shipping charges would have been $22 ... not worth the headache.."
3.0,"I am thankful I was able to return, thanks"
3.0,The material starts to fade after so many washes and fuzz balls appear.
3.0,I wish the pendant itself was bigger the chain seems cheap
3.0,"Product is great.  Issue will be getting a fully functioning set.<br />2 of 4 were defective in the first order. The snap broke off of one and the 2nd one would not stay fastend.<br />Received a 2nd order and 2 of 4 were defective again...however, I now have a set of 4 functional extenders."
3.0,"This is ok. The top of the arm part is super big, and I have chubby arms. It fits fine everywhere else but makes my big arms look bigger which is not great. Good for the price though!"
3.0,Found it difficult to use
3.0,"I like them, but tad inexpensive, so quality is just ok.  They don't always stay up either, but they are cute!"
3.0,"I realize that amber is highly variable, but still -- the earrings that arrived were an almost solid, dark turquoise blue with no green flecks in them at all. I'll keep them anyway as the color is pretty and goes with a dress I'm wearing to a couple of weddings, but they are most definitely not &#34;blue green&#34; as advertised."
3.0,So cute just too small
3.0,"Cute, but small and cheap fabric. The top is fairly sheer."
3.0,"Wasn't for me/my body type. Dress comes as expected and was true to size, just didn't fit like I wanted."
3.0,"very soft, leaves a lot of lint."
3.0,The magnets were not very strong and fell off very easily
3.0,"I was loooking for a shirt with this exact picture and I was happy when I found this on here. Just received this the other day and the shirt is super soft and fits about right but I‚Äôm a little disappointed with the pictures quality.. I‚Äôm gonna try and see if washing it will help, so I‚Äôll leave it at 3 stars for now."
3.0,"I love it but it was too big, and I would definitely order another one."
3.0,They work but aren't flexible for fitting many heel widths and aren't very cute.  The Starlettos fit better and looked better.
3.0,Order small<br />I like it yet the pants are super stretch fell like a medium . Need to find a way to shrink it
3.0,"It was not what I excepted, but you get what you pay for. First easing and apparently one of the snaps came loose and got stuck in my sheet. Not seeing this unfortunately I found it in my bed when something was pinching me."
3.0,Cute but not flattering on my 54 year old athletic frame.
3.0,Overall a good product. A few arrived broken so order extra as a precaution.
3.0,Shoes quality is somewhat ok - I normally use 10.5 size and this shoes is too tight and killing my fingers..<br />so always go 1 size up
3.0,This sweater is fitting around the waist area
3.0,i bought the black pair and LOVE them. i wear them all the time! then i bought the dark denim pair and they are wayyyyy bigger and baggier than the black pair in the same size.
3.0,look nice but will come apart easily
3.0,It doesn't looks like the picture it's big and the color was also  not like shown in the pic
3.0,chain broke after a couple times of wearing
3.0,"Very thin and the emblem is not quality, but it will do the job."
3.0,"Hat is fine, no sweat insert was not delivered with product. Fits as expected."
3.0,"It's warm and comfortable, but the sleeves were a little short; shows an inch past my wrists. And It didn't come with the lace/ribbon like in the picture. It got a three star due to these reasons. Other than that, it's a good product."
3.0,"Hello,<br />I bought these to replace my old lenses in my Oakley Radar sunglasses. The lenses themselves are very comfortable, easy to install, and fit perfectly (they are slightly thinner than the original Oakley made lenses but are more comfortable and make the glasses light weight).<br /><br />However, I purchases the ""Galvanic"" tint lenses thinking that they would be a dark shade, and unable to see my eyes. Unfortunately, they make my sunglasses look like safety glasses now and I rarely wear them. I would give these lenses 5 stars, however hate the way that I look in them and wish the return policy was better. I was unable to return them because physically there was nothing wrong with them, if I were you, get the darkest shade possible. To the makers of these sunglasses, is there any chance I can return mine and get a darker shade so I can change this review to 5 stars for you?<br /><br />Overall, worth the money. However, the vendors ad misrepresents how the product physically looks while on your sunglasses. (see picture attached)."
3.0,Looks like it would be much more stylish and better quality than it actually is. Kind of disappointed when it got here. Cheaply made but I'm gonna wear it as pajamas instead of returning it.
3.0,While I understood it to be a headband I thought it would be a normal size witch hat.  Probably be cute on a kid or someone with a small head.  I have a big old melon head & it looks ridiculous on me.  Deciding if I want to return or gift.
3.0,"I have used this, and it works fine, but it's kind of hard for me to work it.  I don't know why - just doesn't come naturally to me!  It's easier to ask someone to fasten my bracelet."
3.0,"These shorts were of good quality, but I was looking for shorts with a drawstring at the waist."
3.0,"The dress was cute, but it didn't look exactly like in the picture. There was also a few snagged threads around the buttons too."
3.0,"Pretty, but it arrived with a couple of the beads having fallen off. I glued them back on, then wrapped it as a gift. Of course, three more fell off before the person unwrapped it. So, yes it is fun, but be prepared to catch all the beads as they fall, and glue them back on."
3.0,The colour seem very dull compared to what is projected in picture
3.0,Large fits like an Xsmall but the quality is not bad
3.0,It's a tight fit for the size so I'm using it as my motivation to loose a few pounds
3.0,"I must have the wrong size bands.  These are way too big, and move all around the band."
3.0,I liked the way it fit. It‚Äôs a very stretchy material.<br />Just wish the material was a little softer
3.0,"Pretty, but size was a little on the small side."
3.0,Not for women with BOOBS!
3.0,"Only was ably to wear for a few minutes kept slipping doesn‚Äôt pull you in, ordered from the real manufacturer hopefully this one will be better"
3.0,I ordered a large I like it to fit a little loose on my waist. The fit of the pants is good the problem I have is that because it is not actual Jean Jean material when I pulled them up one of the belt loops tore  immediately and that's not a big deal because I can sew it together the problem is I found the same pants on wish for like a total of $15 including shipping so definitely paid more for cheap pants than I should have.
3.0,"You get what you paid for. For the amount of money that you are spending, it is good enough; it definitely has a good look but the steel gets rusted over time. I would recommend it if you are wanting something for short term but if you want something for long-term use, I would recommend to look for something with better quality."
3.0,The color was more brown than caramel
3.0,"Material is thin and the optical illusion is WAY overstated in the picture, very misleading. It still looks ok, but definitely not as in the picture."
3.0,Jewelry also looks very fake instead of real stainless steel.
3.0,"These earrings looks really cool and cute, but they are so fragile and poor material. When i try to open to put in my ear, the piece almost was broken; and it took a curved form. I am not satisfied with this purchase."
3.0,"This is definitely not a good pick for someone with a large wrist. I bought it for a social worker and she is not bone thin, and so this didn't fit. The clasp is extremely hard to hook and unhook and there just isn't much room when it opens up. Opened all the way, you can still barely get it over your hand and on your wrist. But it is very pretty!"
3.0,I like the band but was disappointed with the fact that although the advertisement displayed the image that included a pin vice that would enable the adjustment of the band to fit correctly was not included with the item. I sent in feedback to the seller and have not yet received a reply (3 days and counting)<br />Lou
3.0,After 2 washes the head bands start to not keep it's shape as the edges begin to roll up.
3.0,the bottoms are small and cut into your hips making it look like you have really bad love handles. the tops clip is way to loose making the band huge and forcing you to tie the top really tight.
3.0,Very small. And very light.<br /><br />Its about an inch and a half by the same. w and l.
3.0,"I love it while it works. It lets me wear my metal earrings that I cannot wear due to allergy. But it breaks too easily and for the amount I paid, it‚Äôs a bit too pricy."
3.0,Excellent goes with my car. Just took too long to get here
3.0,"I am not sure this shaper differs much from any other I've tried - it compresses, it's uncomfortable, it rolls down in the back, and it squishes your compressed fat out other spots."
3.0,I ordered according to the size chart and it was too big and looked sloppy!
3.0,"I bought these to work out in. They're perfect for that. I wish they were a little less flowy, though. I don't have much of a chest to fill out the top, which I think makes it fall a bit differently than pictured, for me."
3.0,I hope its true that body parts shrink in cold weather or else I will not be able to wear these gloves. They look really nice but they are too tight/small for me. But they're nice gloves!
3.0,"This is a great dress for the price point. The sleeves are a little odd (the poof out below the elbow) but not a deal breaker. If you have a larger chest, order up unless you enjoy a very tight fit."
3.0,Product fit perfectly but the left glove had a hole on the palm side of the pointer finger‚Ä¶disappointed in that but not returning cause it‚Äôs too much of a hassle
3.0,It's pretty but doesn't fit my neck very much
3.0,Really nice fabric but too big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 118 lbs.
3.0,"I usually love everything I buy from them, but this was just too small and I ordered up. I wish it came in larger sizes because it's really cute, and has fantastic fabric. Nice and soft. The pockets are a nice touch too. I just wish they had larger sizes."
3.0,"The rugged denim fabric and long length of these aprons make them a steal at ten bucks.  However, the straps are its weakest point as they're made of a soft, wide, shoestring-like material.  I imagine these straps will give out years before the rest of the apron.  I wish they simply used the same denim material as the rest of the apron to fabricate the straps.<br /><br />Even so, I would still give these aprons 5 stars as they are a stellar value if they came in good shape, but they did not.  One of the aprons arrived with a tie torn in a few places, rendering it worthless.  Amazon quickly credited my account for the damaged product as another example of the company's great customer service.<br /><br />If you buy these aprons, please thoroughly examine the straps to make sure they came in good shape.  Also, I would not wash these aprons with other fabrics right away because the blue color bleeds when wet."
3.0,I love these! They also make great hair ties.
3.0,Information packet with it was an interesting read.
3.0,The top portion of the dress has a strange corset type front. This is a beautiful dress. Unfortunately the corset portion of the dress does something strange for the front part. The bra portion of the dress is shaped strangely. I felt like it was cardboard covering my chest. It just wasn‚Äôt comfortable. And the top part did not fit.
3.0,"I just received this item and was surprised to see that it isn't a one-piece swimsuit at all...it's just a swim top. The description says &#34;swimsuit&#34; which is definitely misleading. The item is also described as having a &#34;push-up bra&#34; which it definitely does not have. It is a bandeau-style top with a shelf bra and two small soft bra cup inserts. No push-up here! It actually made me look rather flat because it fit me pretty snugly. I ordered a a large, even though I wear medium-sized swim tops because I know items from overseas tend to run small. The tie is sort of cute because I found a couple different ways to tie it. The material is fine and the workmanship seems okay. I'll wear this swimming after I find a black pair of swim bottoms that &#34;match&#34; the material/color/shade of black."
3.0,I love the fabric which is a rayon blend. It drapes very nicely and is very soft for summer. I am short so the pants are about 1-2 inches too long.
3.0,"Not as beautiful and classy as shown in the pictures. I generally wear Small size, but ordered a Medium based on the size chart of the seller (not the Amazon's one), but it runs really large. Wouldn't buy this again."
3.0,"nice hat, my 12 year old son likes it but I thought it was thicker/warmer"
3.0,Returned did not fit watch.
3.0,shirt fits like a toddlers skirt was fine i guess?<br />also the skirt its short in the back and long in the front
3.0,"I received my order very promptly, within 2 days... however one of the rings is missing a diamond out of the flower. Rather than throw it away I guess I'll just take the rest of the diamonds out, I figure it'll still look pretty."
3.0,"As soon as I took the black wallet out of the package, I got hit with a strong garbage dumpster smell.  I'm letting it air out right now and I'm hoping the smell goes away because I absolutely love this wallet. Love all the pockets and it fits my phone perfectly. Spacious enough to fit a lipstick or two, small mirror, pens and more. I purchased it in pink as well and that one has a light scent but nothing like a dumpster. Really hope the smells goes away!"
3.0,i m return the item
3.0,"I thought I was ordering a scarf, not a table cloth. My fault, I didn't read the dimensions. But come on! This enormous piece of fabric would swallow me if I tried to wear it as a scarf. It's soft though. I'll use it as a blanket."
3.0,The ear piece seems like it would break.
3.0,"Good, not very strong"
3.0,I don't like de fabric
3.0,Nice watch but too little for me. I went to an illuminator!
3.0,I loved it when I got it from my husband for valentines day.  I am just a little disapointed because one of the links has broken and now I have to try to find a jeweler that will be willing to repair it.
3.0,"Different from all other shirts, good fit."
3.0,"It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm not super excited about the product. To some extent it feels like used whereas I bought a new one"
3.0,Thin material but can work around it.
3.0,I liked that the shirt fits but the shorts are small...I would said the shirt is the exact sizes on the chart but the shorts are one and a half almost 2 sizes too small
3.0,"The bag looks alright and I don't have time to get a different one, so I am using it. The black stripes are not very vibrant (color looks faded). The internal zipper pocket broke the first time I ever tried to open it. Fortunately, I was able to semi-fix it."
3.0,"Ok, but stitching is not great. Definitely easier than a mask for my kiddo."
3.0,Some are bigger than others.
3.0,It does not fit well too small
3.0,"This dress has a wonderful style and the print is gorgeous! I bought the Grey-Pink chiffon one and fell in love with the print and fit. This dress is a rayon like material and the body fits great but unless your chest is like the model,  you'll be disappointed. Upset the fit is made so VERY  different between the dresses."
3.0,I am short and the dress was mid thigh on me
3.0,"I like the earrings, they are a good deal for the price, but the color is way off.  They are more of a bronze color than a rose gold, the color does not look like what is in the picture."
3.0,"Disappointed that I ordered navy and was sent red. Fits a bit small, ordered 1 size up. Material is soft."
3.0,Suit was good for long torso but larger in chest than expected. Returned.
3.0,"I Do like them but I'm short ,so I wish they were petite I had to cut 3 inch off"
3.0,"The image is a little off center on the back, but otherwise it's a good purchase."
3.0,"I ordered a size small because I am 5'2 and 120 pounds, however, this product felt very restrictive when I put it on. There are three hooks within the coat that are used instead of a zipper to keep the coat together. This coat would have been more comfortable if it was the correct size. I am having a difficult time moving my arms around as I wear it. There's no hood for this coat, but it does have a fur collar. The faux fur is soft and comfortable to touch.<br /><br />I have included an image within this review for a better visual of what this product looks like. The hooks are a bit difficult to keep together, but the belt that comes with the coat may be able to assist with this."
3.0,Not as strong as I thought they would be
3.0,So I really struggle with these because I LOVE how they look and how they fit. BUT they are kind of see through. I can't wear dark underwear with them because if you're stretching and moving around in them (as is normal to do in workout pants) you can see through them. This is extra frustrating because these pants cost SO much. Almost $90 for a pair of pants and you can see through them? Come on.
3.0,great product but not for me
3.0,Cute outfit but it is big for my baby I get extra size for her.  reading the review says it is small for its original size.. pants are not expandable. Over all quality fair for the price.
3.0,"I was under the impression that these had some texture to them but they are absolutely flat. They are also smaller than the reference picture depicts. They're still cute, but not what o was expecting."
3.0,The material was not great. But it was a cute outfit and my son loves it.
3.0,"Beautiful kurta but runs small, not ‚ÄúAmerican size‚Äù.  I‚Äôm a size 12-14 and purchased a 3x. It fits but chest is a little snug. Since this is for purpose of visiting religious country, it may look inappropriate to wear tight around breast area- and see through as well.  It‚Äôs not s√∫per see through, but given that this is what one would wear in possibly religious functions, it may be disrespectful to customs in that area. The material is very pretty and I love the set. Also- since I will be visiting very hot country, it‚Äôs more comfortable to wear very loose fitting attire."
3.0,"The dress is lovely, is very summary and not too reveling but unfortunaly got the wrong size. It was tight in the chest area. I am usually a 12 but in this I should of gotten 12 to 14 instead of 10 to 12. besides that, the dress for great waist down and even straps but just too tight there."
3.0,"The concept of this is very, very pretty; and I was really excited to find such an affordable simple white lace dress that was modest enough and fully-lined. I have wanted a nice white lace dress for church, etc., for several years and thought I'd give this a try when I saw it. I like the stretchy fabric and how easy it is to throw this type of dress on and off without worrying about wrinkles, etc. Unfortunately, it has two major issues that caused me to return it: 1) the waist is cut very high and there are lots of bulky gathers at the waist, so the dress fits much boxier than I expected and gives a bunchy &#34;little girl&#34; look instead of a slim adult shape that comes in enough at the waist for a woman; & 2) the scale of the lace pattern is huge. I am a petite woman and the scale of the scrolls and flowers, etc., was overwhelming on me. The smallest size (small) was also just a bit too large on me (and I'm smaller than most women I know but not tiny), so that didn't help things. 5' 3&#34;, 130 lbs. Overall, if the waist were cut a few inches lower and the dress came in more at the waist to conform to a woman's hourglass shape, and if the lace pattern weren't so large as to make a young woman look dowdy and old-fashioned, I would have kept this. Pick a more subtle lace and tailor this better, and I would buy it in a heart-beat."
3.0,i love it but it is chinese size a large is still way to small
3.0,"Really comfy workout leggings, they fit great,  and I suggest getting your regular size.<br />Downside though- they're see through! I'll just wear some shorts under them or wear a long shirt and I'll be fine"
3.0,I love the dressy look but it snags on certain fabrics.
3.0,It‚Äôs nice to have the selection of colors and that there are two different lengths. But the end or should I say the actual nut that connects the two ends together and the male threaded end make it limited to items that have a decent sized hole it to connect to. I cannot judge on sturdiness and durability yet because you need to have the in use for some time to make that judgment. I will say that that one came damaged already and am not sure on all others as I haven‚Äôt tried to screw each together just to test. These were used in combination with some other purchased products as Christmas gifts and did not have the time at the time as I was putting together what I needed at the time and then wrapping the items. So of the six needed at the time it actually cost me seven having to throw one away due to damage of the threaded male end. Checked female end by screwing onto one of the other rings and it was ok. It appears the the male end was egg shaped I think due to the way the end is squeezed onto the cable. So I‚Äôm still somewhat happy with them but I have seen better types similar to this but could not find that particular product anymore. So I can‚Äôt really give it any higher of a rating at this time nor do I want to make a recommendation for others to purchase. That will be up to them as I did and let them judge later. Thank again for asking  the opportunity to voice my honest opinion C.N.
3.0,Runs very small... giving to my daughter since it doesn't fit me.
3.0,"6‚Äô and 170lbs. Ordered a large like all my other shirts. Slightly too small when it showed up, and after washing i cant wear it anymore. Logo and fabric are great and soft so its a shame"
3.0,Bought a large and though tags say large they run like a medium. I use them around the house so exposed bottom biscuits pleases my husband.
3.0,I like its a little toTight too tight
3.0,One of the feathers fell off after a month. Not impressed with the quality but you get what you pay for
3.0,"Eh, (shoulder shrug) not fabulous but ok to keep. The red looks faded and has a seem down the middle. I will keep this as a lounging dress but not one I feel I could dress up at all."
3.0,Just wish they would have sent different colors instead of the same.  They work good in the sun and not to heavy
3.0,"I bought this for an upcoming graduation and was looking forward to wearing this dress. The dress itself is very well made and the material was better than I expected. Although it fit well the length was WAY TO LONG! I'm 5' 6"" and even with 2 inch heels the dress was still 3 to 4 inches to long and dragging on the ground. Sadly I had to return it."
3.0,it does its job its a little big at the back and arms and im not to fond of the material its made of but it yeah i like it oh it also moves with me like if i tense up my shoulders it creats a bump almost plus you might want to remove the tag because it makes a lot of noise
3.0,This looked much cuter online than it did in person.  It was a bit smaller than expected and didn't fit my body well.
3.0,The snap part is nice but the chain is gaudy as heck
3.0,"I bought the wallet in error.<br /><br />It is a well made item, however it is not a style that I like. I don't care to fold bills in half.I like a true bi or tri-fold.<br /><br />This wallet will become a nice gift for someone."
3.0,These are very think and good for winter but not under regular boots
3.0,"The dresses hems were totally uneven, so badly that  one side was noticeably longer than the other and dragged on the ground! This was the blue and red trimmed dress.<br /><br />Edit: bought the light blue with white &#34;embroidered&#34; edges. Super cute no uneven hems. Maybe not worth $23 but I'm keeping it."
3.0,"Didn‚Äôt feel or look great, but it was cheap‚Ä¶ so at least I didn‚Äôt spend a lot of money on it."
3.0,"I like a mid-calf cargo shorts (I guess the gender that doesn‚Äôt identify as ‚Äúa man‚Äù would call them capri‚Äôs, but that‚Äôs a little too gay for me, not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with someone else being gay). These shorts qualify but the zipper is cheap, the stitching is crap, etc. For the money I was expecting more. I get better stuff from the thrift store."
3.0,Beautiful dress. It fits a little tighter than I would like
3.0,They are the cutest socks but they don‚Äôt come up high<br />Enough to see them over my ankle boots. I wish they did they are super sexy! I guess they‚Äôre made for sandals.
3.0,The bag had great storage compartments and fit everything I needed for walking around Disney. I didn‚Äôt like the straps. They dug into my shoulders and were very uncomfortable.
3.0,The sling bag itself is ok. Just the size was too small. You can't really put anything in there.
3.0,"Too small , looked cheaply made, not great .<br />The return seemed not as smooth as usal ."
3.0,"It's quite big, the colors are nice and feels very warm."
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed in the hue of the stone, otherwise, it was a nice ring"
3.0,"Soft, thin material. One pair had a small hole upon arrival, but my biggest dislike is that they are not really high waisted as described. They fall right in the middle where I do not like. I didn't bother returning since me and my girls can just use them as ""house pants"", but I was somewhat disappointed."
3.0,Some fit well while others do not.
3.0,"I bought these items as a option to replace cutting up t-shirts that get frayed and such.  I love the fit and material, but one stitch gets pulled and you have that annoying line in shirt, and its all down hill from there."
3.0,Not too bad but a Little cheesy
3.0,good price good product
3.0,Purse is nice but straps are not long enough to put on shoulder
3.0,"Wear size 5 in Women's, ordered size 35 in both black and red. Red style fits tight; however, black style fits perfectly. Shoes are exactly as described... in the photos... Two completely different shoes under one listing. Color is NOT the only difference!"
3.0,"I wore this dress on vacation. The dress started pilling where my purse would rub. It's a great dress fit and style, I just wish it was made from different material."
3.0,They were a bit smaller than I expected and were not solid all the way through.  Not what I expected.
3.0,"Nice glitter, but sort of scratches your skin, and glitter falls off."
3.0,"Okay, doesn't suit me though. Would probably work for someone else."
3.0,The material in the picture seemed thicker and higher for bigger girls. My husband liked it when I tried on.
3.0,I actually love the dress but it was long sleeved instead of quarter length and it was big. I guess that is why it was long sleeved...
3.0,"Very pretty dress, but fit is on large size -&#34;off the shoulders&#34; is way off!"
3.0,tight around top area and I am not top heavy! Other than that it does its purpose
3.0,Runs really big and very long.
3.0,The item does not have any attachment to the face mask and is loose inside. It also causes my glasses to fog up.
3.0,"First of all this watch is fantastic.  Its a great classy seiko diver.  The diashield coating works fantastic, its reasonably accurate, and the finishing is pure art.  My only issue is the bezel.  The amount of back play and the action is unnacceptable  for a watch at this price point.  It has almost a full mm of play at the 12 oclock position.  The lume is also applied inconsistantly.  Now im not sending the watch back.  Im happy with it and i can look past these quality control issues.  I dont expect absoloute perfection but if you minused these 2 issues this watch would be a steal."
3.0,the material i never really like but the dress is nice fit ok
3.0,its pretty small...
3.0,Not sure its real
3.0,"Good size, but if the user eats more than sandwiches, you'll need a waterproof under bib!"
3.0,The shoes are nice and well made for my son learning to walk.  Only downside is I was really looking forward to the cute robot design but they sent me space ship shoes.
3.0,Just did not fit right.  To small on top and way to big on waistline.
3.0,"they‚Äôre pretty nice but take note of care instructions.  if you don‚Äôt want to hand wash your socks and lay them flat to dry, better off buying a blend or another brand.  there are merino wool products that are wash and dry but not these.  they are warm tho."
3.0,"Love the dress, would have fit perfect in XS-have to do alterations. The bow is a little awkward not staying in place."
3.0,"cute, but really thin and the front part is fussy( it opens and closes as you move so I found myself pulling on it to be comfortable)."
3.0,SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE AND NOT A STAND OUT......
3.0,"Good quality,but way too bulky.  Magnet snap does not line up"
3.0,This onsie looks and feels great. I give it three stars because of just that.<br /><br />It is BIG. The guy in the picture must be 7 feet tall cause on my 6 foot (150 lbs) boyfriend it bunches up at his feet and touches the floor.<br /><br />This is not one size fits most. It is for big or tall people. They should really make them in other sizes so I could purchase one that fits him.
3.0,Kind of looks cheaply made. The red looks like it would come off in one wash.  I bought it as a gift and I'm trying to decide if I want to return it or not
3.0,Was too big on my daughter. Fit more like a 2T not 12 months. After washing a couple time the glitter is coming off.
3.0,LOVE IT but too heavy & it cuts into my ear :-(<br />if it didn't cut my Ear I would give it a 5 star.
3.0,"I like it, but I wish the telescoping rod had more resistance. It extends all the way if you try to hold the umbrella by the handle or loop, instead of staying compact until you want to open it."
3.0,It is very long but not long enough to wear as like a dress with leggings
3.0,"Initially I loved this belt, it feels sturdy and looks great.  However, in less than 4 months the stitching that holds the belt loop in place has started to come loose.  I will be looking for a new belt!"
3.0,The magnet isn't strong enough to keep the watch from loosening. One side refused to stay latched into my watch.
3.0,"I wanted to love this shirt, honest I did but once again I was too optimistic buying an XL based on the fit on the model.  The XL fit me but did not compare to the fit on the model. Clothing specifically made for ‚Äúplus sizes‚Äù are made proportionately, clothing not made for plus sizes just adds ‚Äúwidth‚Äù without length leaving the clothing to look boxy or ‚Äúwide‚Äù. I‚Äôve bought ‚Äúplus size‚Äù tops which are wider AND just a bit longer so that they fit as intended, this top was wider but not longer. The fabric was ‚Äúok‚Äù but I wasn‚Äôt totally sold.<br /><br />This top left me feeling just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. You might like it or you might not. Try it for yourself."
3.0,"Doesn't accommodate heads above 7.5 well, though big heads should be smart enough to read and look elsewhere. Not me though."
3.0,"This sweater vest was enormous. I'm 5'7 with an hourglass/slight pear shape and wear a 24W top and 26W bottom. The 2X was like a tent dress on me. I have wide shoulders and it was sliding off the sides.  It's also not very flattering on curvy bodies because it ends mid-thigh, past the optimal point for flattery (widest point of the hips). It might be better on thinner physiques and wear it like a dress, not a vest.<br />It is soft though, and feels pretty well made. Just not for me."
3.0,It came flat and not easy to bend to anyone's face.
3.0,"The positive: These socks are wonderfully soft. As I had hoped, they are thicker than a regular sock, but not excessively bulky. The colors are delightful.<br />The neutral: the socks are a little shorter than I‚Äôd prefer for outdoors, but they will be fine for everyday wear.<br />The negative: two of the five pair have many loose/broken threads. I haven‚Äôt washed them and I‚Äôm hoping the threads won‚Äôt break any further."
3.0,Not nearly as cuddly as you'd think. Color is good though.
3.0,"Very comfy, but very thin. Shows all your bumps and bulges. Would have liked the shorts to be a tad longer. But not a dealbreaker"
3.0,"This pendant is tiny. Good luck reading what it says on there. The chain is delicate which I like and seems strong. If the pendant was larger, I would give it 5 stars."
3.0,"I normally wear a large (women‚Äôs 10ish), I ordered a large, and it fits. I think the print looks a little different than it does in the photos. The color is definitely a bubblegum pink rather than soft pastel pink. The collar is a little weird and I am hoping it will lay down after some wear and washing. The sleeves are actually full length, not 3/4!!! But it does have the built in ties in the sleeves so you can roll them up to 3/4 length."
3.0,Looks just like the photo and the strap is adjustable but the pocket is extremely small and once you put something in there it makes the bear flip inside down.
3.0,"I ordered the burgundy and it is in fact a pretty bright red, so be warned. This dress was extremely unflattering on me. I sized down according to the comments, but I should have sized down even more. I think this is probably just personal style preference since some of the other commenters look great."
3.0,Not as flattering as in the picture. Large pink flowers over the breast area.
3.0,"The fit was good and neckline is nice. I‚Äôm not sure if it was done on purpose or accidentally, but one of the pockets is reversed. My theory is so that if you wore it with the strap on the other shoulder (like if it‚Äôs reversible), you could put your hand in a pocket, but I‚Äôm not sure. It could have just been made wrong.<br />Wasn‚Äôt see through. Looks a little cheap but would work."
3.0,"It's ok. Not sure exactly what I expected; considering when you get down to brass tacks it's just a strip of cloth. I suppose I thought it would be a bigger length for a "" one size fits all"" situation. I wear a 71/4 hat and it doesn't leave a lot of room after I knot it.<br />I bought it to wear to a martial arts class to keep the sweat out if my eyes. By no means would I consider it an absorbent material at all.<br />None of this is a know against the seller or the merchandise. It actually reflects a different lesson. Figure out what you need and get the item that most suits that purpose. If your goal is to wear a black piece of cloth on your head you've come to the right place!"
3.0,"This is fairly nice bracelet except that the drawstrings on one side is not pulling to open or close, so it is kind of hard to put on, so I am not<br />too impressed with it and or the quality."
3.0,"I like the AUSELILLY clothing line. Their clothing is well made, the fabric always has some ""give"" to it, and the  designs are well thought out before putting needle and thread to the materials. So I ordered this dress with the idea of wearing it out on hot summer days to go into town for errands.<br /><br />The fabric is a stretchy polyester-spandex blend, with elastics just under the bust and at the high waist line. The cap sleeves have a ruffle at the end. The design is a nice muted black and cream paisley print, and it reminds me of what we were wearing back when I was in undergraduate school. If you were a ""Deadhead"" then or now, then this would be for you. It has a kinda-sorta empire waist, but the tuck at the waist with the elastic makes it m0ore of a Fit-And Flair. If you are curvy, this should be a good selection for your wardrobe.<br /><br />On measuring this dress, what stuck out the most was the length measures 9"" longer than the size chart. I also didn't care for the way that the sleeves stood out from the shoulders, Another 2"" would have solved that issue. More than likely this stems from the proportions when the original design is modified to fit into the S-XL size categories. Sometimes the original design isn't retained in all of the sizes. The length makes it look like a ""house dress"" that you see housewives wearing in the old black and white sitcoms from the '60's.<br /><br />After trying it on, I dove into my sewing kit and pinned the bottom hem up in an asymmetrical line above the knees, and it came out looking much better, and more like the look in the ads. I will hem everything up at the bottom hem so that the line sits above the knees, and remove the cap sleeves, and this will be a ""keeper"". But it will be a different design at that point, as basically I will be making my own dress.<br /><br />Overall, if you are curvy and in a smaller size, this will work for you. Otherwise, get out your sewing kit!"
3.0,Very cute dress just thin and it also runs small.
3.0,"They are pretty a little bigger than I thought. I don't like the lever back, it's hard to open and close."
3.0,"Very cute dress, but a little small in the bust. It's also a little short in the back."
3.0,This will not work if you are larger than a D cup or so. It is a nice thickness and well made. I have bought other things from this seller that are great. It just didn't come close to fitting my large chest.
3.0,Not as good as my first pair bit too small. Thinner with less cushion
3.0,This was great at first it fit perfectly but within a couple weeks it was stretched out and and wouldn‚Äôt sit in one spot on my wrist anymore which was frustrating
3.0,It looks like a decent band but not sure how long it will last. Leather scratches very easily. Overall it‚Äôs ok.
3.0,"It's big, even for my big noggin, which is fine.  I don't have many glasses which provide that &#34;big glasses look&#34;, but there's no nose bridge so the glasses slide down my Asian nose."
3.0,"I love this top; but, unfortunately I don't wear it as often as I would like because it has to be ironed and its very hard to iron."
3.0,These were so so cute. Got so may compliments. But they broke after a few wears.
3.0,I really love this top and how it fits but it feels so cheap. Definitely not worth $20.
3.0,"Beautiful baby pink watch band and face protector! I own it in black and I loved it so I ordered pink. It arrived with the watch face protector broken in the package. Too much trouble to return it. Will keep it and just use the band part, because the band is so pretty!"
3.0,"It's satisfactory, but there are better ones."
3.0,much smaller than I expected and the straps are too short. hard too get on and off.it des have lots of pockets.
3.0,I can still wear them I thought they would fit loose they are snug around the buttocks
3.0,"For the price, these will do but the material is pretty cheap and I dont know how long these will last."
3.0,"This was a birthday gift by use of a Amazon gift card.<br />I searched endlessly to find a backpack in my price range<br />Of $25.00 it cost $21.99 & unfortunately it came from<br />China direct, however when received it it looked nice but<br />hard to put my bible in it cause the opening is not wide enough.<br />So I forced it in anyway not one week later I went to put it on my<br />back and the strap broke so I had to cut the other one to carry it by the<br />handle strap. Although it is faux leather it is cheaply made & not worth the<br />Hassle of trying to send it back to China for refund.<br />I will not purchase anything else from Amazon that comes from out of this<br />Country period. This is not my first experience with purchases like this from Amazon<br />that import from foreign countries especially clothing it is such a great disappointed<br />a waste of time & Money.<br />Just being truthful.<br />Thanks!!!!"
3.0,It‚Äôs sopposed to fit a D cup ü§£ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ um more like an A!!!!
3.0,Hoodie is perfect but I didnt recieve the keychain and I'm debating sending it back because of this
3.0,"Arrived on time and in good condition. It is somewhat larger than I expected, but it's okay."
3.0,I love the bracelet it was very beautiful but just too small for my arm I said it back
3.0,"Needed a wide and comfortable all purpose shoe.  This has turned into that shoe.  However, it looks and feels cheaply made.  Part of the stitching on the inside occasionally rubs against my foot causing intermittent pain. The leather upper has stretched over time and otherwise it fits reasonable well.<br />The fabric and construction is becoming cheaper and the prices keep rising."
3.0,I think this tee runs a bit small.  The color wasn‚Äôt as I had expected .  I ended up returning it.
3.0,Too small very tight fit but good idea
3.0,"It did not come on two different chains, it came with both pieces on one and I do not have the tools needed to take one off and put on the other chain. Also the two chains were tangled and I had to untangle them."
3.0,"I'm going to be reordering this in a larger size.  I ordered a medium, but it was too tight in the chest area, and the bottoms were a little snug as well.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 135 and a 36 B chest.  Other than the sizing, it was a super cute suit.  I can't wait to get the right size."
3.0,"The product was almost as expected however none of us, on Christmas morning, were able to attach the straps to the spurs. The hole/slit wouldn‚Äôt go over the spur button. Hopefully we can soften the leather enough to attach the straps to the Spurs."
3.0,"The case is lovely, but the coloring yellowed in the sun. Too bad :("
3.0,I really liked this headpiece. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the decorative chain on the side fell off before I was able to wear it the my event.
3.0,Very full skirt. Ended up tailoring it by having a large chunk of material taken out of each side of skirt. Then it looked great. Still worth the price my daughter still really liked it
3.0,"Not only was the material thin, they were too tight (yes, I ordered my correct size) and outer layer that is supposed to be loose was skin tight as well. I even ordered a size up just in case and those weren‚Äôt good either."
3.0,"just to small, bought two different pants at same time could get them on but to tight , could not able to even get on so small , and bought a size larger than i thought i would need , because though could be took in , but not a chance to make biger  way miss sized"
3.0,I‚Äôm giving this shirt 3 stars because it was super cute but it runs very small !! I ordered a 2x and it felt like a medium! And it was super short . Returning it
3.0,These are a little larger (length) than I expected. Otherwise no issues.
3.0,"Honestly for the price you cant really complain much. It arrived in a good package. The bracelets looked great when worn, while they lasted. Bought them on 1/9/2018 and already the leather got loose from the metal clasp on both the blue and brown ones. Haven't worn the three other colors. Will check out other ones and update the review. Meanwhile if anyone has a recommendation for a better brand please share. I just want both blue and brown bracelets."
3.0,"I got the black patent ones. I was originally wanting to get the velvet or suede, kinda glad I didn't if the sizing is the same through all of them. I think these are sexy, fun and different. BUT......you cannot wear these over pants which I think is very inconvenient and hard to work around. I spent a lot of time reading reviews before buying these and not one review mentioned the fact that the ankle area is insanely tight and small. Unless you plan to wear these with just panty hose and skirts, you can't wear them over pants or leggings, and that's a huge disappointment for me and doesn't make these very versatile. My legs are on the slimmer side, they aren't super skinny but not large either at all so if you have muscular legs or cankles or thick calves you will definitely NOT be able to wear these. The reviews with photos are very very misleading since it looks like the reviewers are wearing them with regular jeans on (how??) and a big factor in what convinced me to buy these.<br /><br />I managed to get them to fit (just barely) over stretch pant leggings but with a lot of struggle and bunching around the lower calf area and ankle which kind of bugs me. But the foot area fits perfectly with some room and seems very comfortable to walk in otherwise.<br /><br />So buyers, keep this in mind. If these weren't so cute with the clear heel I would have returned them."
3.0,"I feel these are bunchy at the top and too short above the ankles. They ""get stuck"" in the lower calf area, and I need to tug them down, when going from sitting to standing. Love the color, and they look like they will wear well, as the fabric is great."
3.0,"The color and fit were fine, but the bottom of the pants were loose.  Instead of being tight against my leg, they stuck out from the sides so I sent them back."
3.0,It‚Äôs a comfortable shirt. I don‚Äôt like the twist on the hem because it doesn‚Äôt seem to want to lay the right way. The stitching is coming out after just a couple of times wearing it.
3.0,I really enjoyed wearing this dress for Halloween as a Bond Girl from &#34;Gold Finger&#34;. A few things- it's ROSE GOLD not gold. There's no zipper and dress is not stretchy at all. I got a zipper put in the back because it was difficult to in get in the front of the romper. And do expect some sequins to fall out and get stuck together all the time. But overall everyone loved it! I received a lot of compliments üòä!
3.0,I underestimated the meaning of oversizedüòû
3.0,"it‚Äôs cute, but i‚Äôll probably never wear them because the hearts are so bulky that i‚Äôd have to wear a few bras just to hide the fact that i have the piercing"
3.0,No invoice with swimsuit. How do I return or exchange ?[[ASIN:B01DS1BVOQ One Piece Floral Ruched Halter Push Up Slim Tummy Control Tankini Swimdress]] from DANIFY SIN# B01DS1BVOQ.[[ASIN:B01DS1BVOQ One Piece Floral Ruched Halter Push Up Slim Tummy Control Tankini Swimdress]]
3.0,"When I first bought this, the length was on the floor. I buy big for the purpose of growth. After one wash, the length is above her ankles. The jumper either shrunk or she grew taller after one month. Luckily for her, girls can wear ankle pants. Too late to return, no tags and it was a month."
3.0,Make sure you measure your belt correctly first. I didn't and it would cost more to return than to get my money back.  It is a solid buckle though.
3.0,"This is printed fabric, kind cheap but still pretty."
3.0,"I ordered an XL because I have a pair of Large that were getting a little snug, but these are much smaller than the Large ones I already have."
3.0,It's cute but shorter on me than I thought it would be.
3.0,If you have a big head it would be perfect.  I realize how to wear it scrunched but with no hair it swallows up my entire head.  Unfortunately it will have to go back which breaks my heart because its so pretty.
3.0,the headband is cute! the tail does look kind of short and stumpy & awkward. my costume came w a headband so i‚Äôm just returning it
3.0,"I followed the sizing chart. Order a size up for sure, even if you are on the small end. Skirt is a good material but the shorts underneath fit more like underwear and if I bent over even a little my whole butt would show."
3.0,Good material. I got the grey one and it is much lighter than it appears on the Amazon page. The ends also split really easily when I tried to get the straps through the watch openings.
3.0,The lens are not very dark
3.0,I like them.. but they're crooked! Hopefully I can fix them. :(
3.0,"The socks are cute and generally fit as expected (a few pairs seem a bit smaller than the others).  However, the material is extremely thin and I don't expect to get very many wearings out of them before the heels and toes disappear."
3.0,They are just a little loose in the waist so they slipped down also need more room in the front.
3.0,"I like the color, I like the style."
3.0,"I ordered a large, my normal size, and it was 2 sizes too small. I reordered it in an XXL and I hope that it will be a better fit. Cute, but not as cute as in the picture. Came very wrinkled and it's hard to iron them out."
3.0,"Looking at these boots makes you want to try them on. They have a lush faux fur lining that feels so soft on the feet. Of course, if you are in a true snow zone, you'll want to wear socks and have some pants on that will also keep you warm. With that in mind, I tried these on without all the other items and couldn't zip them up all the way. Strangely, the ankle was very loose. I tried tightening the laces more at the ankle and although it helped a little, the boot still bunched at the ankle. They do have a good tread.<br />The brown color is not my favorite. I think they call it pecan in furniture. The boot is the same color as my kitchen table. It kind of makes the fake leather look... well, really fake.<br />In snow boots, you want to have room for socks and pants because presumably, you'll need that on a cold snowy day.  In that instance, these boots fall short. The calf was too tight and the foot/ankle too large."
3.0,"Looked cheaper than expected, it's okay."
3.0,This arrived with the zipper coming unstitched
3.0,Like way too big
3.0,I love it! Just wish they weren't so small and came in American sizes.
3.0,Was a little to crop for me ordered L it fit but was a little too short. Was fuzzy and very soft would have liked to keep but returned just couldn‚Äôt use that short
3.0,The pros:<br />1.  Reliable time movement.<br />2. Manual and automatic winding<br />3. Looks good.<br /><br />The cons:<br />1. The protective piece surrounding the winding screw fell off the first day.<br />2. The date indicator has 37 days so every month it needs to be adjusted.
3.0,"This track suit seems to be well made but runs small (ordered 3x, feels like 1.5x) and the zipper latches on the left side instead of the right side."
3.0,Nothing special just another sweaty watch band. I just needed a white band
3.0,Soft light material and looks great with a belt. After washing though it is hard to get the wrinkles out. I also think the neckline is too low. Order a size down. I am 5'6 140lb and ordered a medium. I would recommend a small.
3.0,They still give some glare but is better then not having them on
3.0,I love these but they shrunk when I washed them.
3.0,A little too big. I think the small/medium is more of a medium.
3.0,A little larger & thinner material than expected going by the pics.
3.0,This carrier handle arrived broke but we will fix it better than this was built.
3.0,"These are soft and fairly comfortable, but they are more like tights. They are thin and on the border of being a bit sheer. I don't think they will last very long because they don't seem to be great quality. They have held up so far after two wears and washes but I'm not holding my breath for many more."
3.0,"Very cute, fit nicely. Only 3 stars because it got a hole in the crotch in one wear. Thankfully I have sewing skills and was able to easily fix it."
3.0,I LOVE Tsum Tsums but this sweet t shirt faded after one wash. Sad that it did not stay on longer.  :) Hope this was helpful to someone!
3.0,"More trianglular than the photo, not greatly pleased!"
3.0,Not exactly what I expected but I can make it work. Love the color
3.0,Cute jacket but it is very small and there was a very noticeable torn seam upon arrival.
3.0,"The one I received had two sharp jagged edges. Nice size, a little thin, I returned it"
3.0,"I ordered this dress in yellow and although it feels heavy, it is incredibly see-through and it is difficult for me to find any undergarments that won‚Äôt show through. :("
3.0,It's a cute shirt but it runs small.
3.0,"Not the shirts fault but it isn't flattering on someone short with a short torso. Goes to mid thigh and when I tie it, only gets worse."
3.0,"So I‚Äôve purchased both the brown leather band and the black leather band. Right off the bat, the brown band is made with much better quality material than the black band. However, the latch on my brown leather band has an issue compressing so it is impossible for me to attach and detach it from the face of the watch. I have to have my significant other do it and he has to use tools, which is just ridiculous and inconvenient. As far as the appearance of the bands, both look nice. I am happy with the aesthetic. I wish the black band was made from the same material as the brown. It looks cheaper. The latch on the black band is completely functional, so I‚Äôm torn. These products work for the most part, I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,its ok for the price. Can't really shape it cuz then it crinkles. It will do for the price.
3.0,"I can feel my breath externally when wearing this. It has very thin layers that separate just by breathing. I do like the metal nose piece and the fit though. I really don't think this can provide more protection than regular surgical masks. As thin as they are, washing them will wear them thinner fast. My 9 year old says this irritates his face and nose, so he won't wear them. I find the inner layer annoying because it flaps in and out while you're breathing. I like that they're made in the US because it seems wrong to buy products from other countries at this point. They just aren't the most comfortable with the loose inner layer.  I tested this with the candle blow test and a water test and the mask failed immediately. So these are not masks I feel comfortable wearing in public around people. Definitely not masks I feel safe sending my kids in to school. I wear them only for times when I'll just be sitting in the car briefly interacting with a pharmacist or grocery pickup person."
3.0,"Pretty, but a bit long"
3.0,"Firstly, the seller. Fast shipping, great response time to emails, good customer service. Unfortunately, they don't do exchanges. Returns only. Secondly, the shoe. All of my Chucks (both regular and Street Cabs) have always been size 10 and fit perfectly. This pair clearly said &#34;size 10&#34;, both on the box and inside the shoes. However, it felt like 11 or 12 on my feet. Really weird, not sure what gives. Very unfortunate, coming from someone like Converse. I tried to exchange them for a smaller size, but, per seller, I had to return these for a refund and just buy a smaller size again. At that point I lost interest. Refund posted very quickly though, so that's nice."
3.0,"They are super as a fashion statement, but if you go out with them on temperatures below 10 Celsius you are in for a frosty treat... I would add another thermo layer. It is a real pity since they really look lovely."
3.0,was pretty but tarnished very quicky after two wears
3.0,"Soft cotton.  Nice adjustable straps.  My only reason not giving it 5 stars is that the actual band around the chest, below the breast is thin and not tight enough, fits everywhere else."
3.0,"Not crazy about the quality or design placement. When the band is sized, you can‚Äôt see the character silhouettes. Also thought it‚Äôd be sparkly/glittery and it was like a sublimation. It was okay."
3.0,"I love the color and style of the joggers, my only complaint is that when they arrived they had a tear in them."
3.0,I gave them as a gift to my wife for Christmas. When she opened them there was one of the feathers missing.
3.0,Just a little snug!
3.0,The split was pretty high for work when walking around. It‚Äôs cute and I did wear it once but may donate to a friend or something. It was just alright.
3.0,Bought a 3x and it fits like an XL. Buy 2 sizes up.
3.0,"The material is not that great. I'm 5'0&#34; and ~95 lbs. and the dress is to my knees and huge at the waist. I like the shape so I'll have it altered, but generally I'm not very happy with it as is. Fits nothing like the photo. These Asian sellers think they're the only small petite people and that all Americans are fat it seems."
3.0,Nice feel but kinda small
3.0,"I give it a 3 star because size was very small for a size 6. My daughter is 4 wearing size 6, that's the reason why I got it. But it fit a lil smaller than I thought. Quality is pretty good and also it was shorter than I was hoping."
3.0,"Looks good,fits good but the collar doesn‚Äôt stay up like in the picture"
3.0,I was pleasantly surprised. A little tight in the bust if you are well endowed.
3.0,Cheap and felt like they were going to crack when I put them on. They‚Äôre cute though
3.0,"When I received these straw earrings, they looked beautiful. The weight of these earrings was not too heavy as seen in pictures. But the length of the back part insert of the earring is small that the screw barely fits into it. As there is no room, the earring is tight and the screw presses on ears.  As a result it is uncomfortable to wear for a longer periods of time."
3.0,Good flip-flops
3.0,nice set!
3.0,"I expected the studs to be silver but they are gold it doesn't look bad just not what I thought it was and I prefer silver over gold. The top zipper on the large bag does not close the entire top. It seems like this was for the purpose of using the cross body strap but there is no way to use the cross body strap without the handles being in the way. If the zipper opened the whole way, the handles could be folded in but it doesn't. Also the studs are only on one side which is odd."
3.0,So this says 100 pieces. They do not come 100 poeces and not all pieces in the picture is delivered to you. I was missing 10 pieces. This is cut and all but i feel ripped off.  Make sure you count them when you get them. Sadly i got the order twice and it was the same. Less pieces and you dont get every songle one thats in tge picture. It doesnt say kixed in title so its misleading.
3.0,its ok..like the cushion feel on the inside
3.0,The anti-fog is not long lasting. One good clean with disinfectant whipes and the lenses fog. The ear pieces are adjustabke and that has made them more confortable. Not for people with larger heads. I have a mid-small head and they press fairly heavily into the sides of my head around my ears.
3.0,"This bead looks great.  However, I thought it would be wider!  It is very thin and sticks out a lot, so it raises the bracelet off your wrist (if you wear it with a pandora).  If it was more rounded, it would be a lot more comfortable and easier to wear."
3.0,"Very high-wasted, which isn't my style. But, the material itself was nice. Not scratchy and very stretchy and well made. Unfortunately, the large was too big."
3.0,The actual sock is just too thick
3.0,"Not he most comforable sneakers, I do like how they look"
3.0,Did the job..kids loved it..hat was small and gift bag was tiny..real tiny...replaced hat brushed out the beard and became Santa. Beard could have been longer and more fluffy.
3.0,"This description is slightly misleading - the boning is FLEXIBLE steel and feels more like your traditional strong plastic boning rather than strong steel. The one I purchased fits perfectly but when bound all the way still does not add shape - if you want a proper pulling in corset go one size smaller than our waistline. If you want true steel boning, this one is not for you."
3.0,Very cute PJ but made with thin material
3.0,The robe seems fine for the price but the sizing runs small. Suggest you buy at least one size up to be comfortable.
3.0,Cheap thin fabric. Too tight for the people I bought them for. Id imagine theyre good for kids or young teens. Cool patterns though.
3.0,"Pattern is very nice.  Fabric is very thin and sheer.  I needed to purchase a long slip to wear underneath because it see through on buttons along the bottom don‚Äôt cover up all the way down.  Would probably be better used as a bathing suit cover up.  Very long also, but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2.  I used with platform wedges and it was still a little of a tripping hazard."
3.0,"I have a broken foot that will now, and always be, larger than my other foot.  This worked to widen some of my shoes so I wouldn't have to purchase all new shoes.  It worked well on mesh shoes & leather shoes but not as well on shoes made with synthetics.  I am going to try again because some folks have recommenced using a special liquid shoe softener."
3.0,I have to wear glasses now and my eyes are so sensitive to the sun that I needed to get something. I read all the reviews and ordered these. I like the bling of the rhinestones but they still look like old people sunglasses. It does the job while I drive but I won't wear them on the beach.
3.0,Nice for a few seasons. Pretty color.
3.0,"Offered March 22, 2020 received today July 7, 2020 earrings look fine but too late"
3.0,Literally this is NOT adjustable. So false advertising.
3.0,This hat was soft and does not hold its shape. The accessories came off easily.
3.0,"I have been looking for a winter cape-coat to replace the item my mother wore years ago. Considering that this was a gift, it was not as thick or heavy as the picture implied. Despite this issue, I gave it as a give...and to my delight, my mother actually loved the coat. To this day, it is one of her favorite winter items (but I am STILL looking for a thicker, heavier cape coat that matches up with my mother's original)."
3.0,I went up two sizes and it's still a little small. I also wish there was a little more fabric on the bottom to give it more of a romper feel than a onesie.
3.0,Body fit was great but arms is tight. But still wearable and a little bit unconfortable.
3.0,"I like this product would be nice if a denture glue, or a  retainer style was a option, but for the price, I did like this product."
3.0,"Works as expected.  Improve the visibility.  Lightweight.<br /><br />The polarized feature is poor in comparison to the renamed brands, you can make the test with the Polarized Test Card included."
3.0,Not compression and size is off. Order a large and its small for me
3.0,"They look really nice and fit most small wrists, but they do not stay on the arm, there is not enough connection."
3.0,Material very thin and stretches out too easily.. very unflattering
3.0,"For the price, I wish the cedar scent would last a little longer. I freshen them up with cedar oil every few weeks. Great product and about the only thing that consistently helps with my foot odor. Just wish the price weren't so high, as they do deteriorate within a couple of months."
3.0,"Large was too big for me, should have bought a smaller size."
3.0,What I didn't like was the sweater I received did not come with any care instructions.  Also it came with broken strings that I needed to weave back in to wear it.  But overall I did like the sweater.  Will need to wear a cami underneath the sweater.
3.0,wish I had went with a solid NO GOLD wrap around . then they would be cute
3.0,"A bit disappointing, got a XXL to make sure it would be roomy, but it's very snug and I'm not that big."
3.0,"Really cute, it looks like a real blue diamond, it gets compliments all the time."
3.0,I tried using this a couple times on my bucket hat. Just couldn't get it to form or stiffen up. Spray starch worked better.
3.0,"I received the wallet and started using it. About two weeks after I started using it, it started to interest and was no longer in a usable condition."
3.0,"cut way too low, I had to put a scarf on with it and tuck the scarf into my bra. To qualify this, I live in Vegas where EVERYTHING GOES! For me to say it's too low cut is a LOT!"
3.0,"This is a standard watch band, not a short length.  Quality was good."
3.0,"The cufflinks appear gold on-line, but actually have a more brassy tone.  I won't return them because of the effort and they were inexpensive, but the color I thought it was would have been better."
3.0,They become a little loose after wearing them for a while.
3.0,"First, it takes FOREVER to get this item.  When it arrived it had a strange smell but that went away after washing.  I like this shirt, don't love it, but like it.  It's not exactly the material I was expecting but think it will look good with a pair of casual heels and jeans.  I am 200lbs, 5'7&#34; and ordered an XL."
3.0,"These worked great for the first 4-5 months. Now the clips don't hold the shirt properly, and  they come undone very easily."
3.0,"I'll love it to be more breathable and a little bit loose.  Otherwise, the color and form are perfect.<br />Thanks,"
3.0,"Nice Size, but the material is too thick."
3.0,"Low quality, custom-printed product, maybe homemade."
3.0,It‚Äôs just ok. I was disappointed by the lining in this jacket. It feels cheap and looks ratty. The picture looks like there is a design stitched on the pockets but there is not. It‚Äôs good for a bonfire in the back yard but I would not wear it out. It also took 2 months to arrive. I should have researched where it was coming from.
3.0,"The ring is extremely lightweight, which almost makes it feel fake.  I realize wood is lighter than metal, but I just don't like the feel of it.  The wood grain isn't the greatest in my eyes either.  I have another ring in a similar style, and this just looks cheap in comparison.  I'm giving three stars because it is true to size and quite durable."
3.0,"For the $$ this is not a bad purchase. It's very &#34;floppy&#34; and does not hold its shape well, but it didn't go flying off my head while on the boat!"
3.0,"I ordered these for my daughter, but working in the medical field, I started my research. According to an American Academy of Ophthalmology report, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not necessary to spend money on special [eyewear] for computer use.‚Äù There is no data that support the evidence that they actually are helping. I returned them. Thank you."
3.0,Beautiful dress but the bust line is not in the right spot. If you have anything but small breast this will not work
3.0,"I love this dress, it fits perfectly but... You can see through it so badly. I can't wear it without a slip of some sort. I haven't found one yet that works with it."
3.0,Like the Sugar Skull watch part but really didn't like the band at all. Not good for anyone with a small wrist.
3.0,"It is a very nice suit and color, but poor quality for the price."
3.0,"I like this necklace.  It hangs nicely and compliments the outfits I've selected to wear with it.  However, the beads used in the piece were a bit dull."
3.0,I like this product but it isn‚Äôt holding up very well. Got what I paid for again.
3.0,"Three stars because of the material, it's that slinky material that is usually used for beach cover ups, was expecting it to be cotton, but it was true to size and I will wear it"
3.0,Beautiful bag but I don‚Äôt think the one I received is authentic. The style number doesn‚Äôt match the Taylor Tote it matches a men‚Äôs brief case.
3.0,Great lightweight scarf that conveniently holds necessaries when needed. Does not wash well. It looks severely warn after one wash.
3.0,It was a tad bit snug around middle
3.0,"I had a kimono dress once that I loved, so I was hoping this one would be just as great. It is really frumpy, and unfortunately, I missed the deadline to return it so I am stuck with it."
3.0,Please note.. I ordered several of the same dress hoping to get one that looked like the picture.  Non of them have that scallop detail on the back like the picture shows Instead of being scalloped it is just straight.  I felt that was one of the cute aspects of the dress and was highly disappointed they actually don't have that detail.
3.0,"My husband goes pretty exclusively to t-shirts once warm weather hits so I am always trying to upgrade his selections.  We had tried Clifton Heritage before with ok results so we took the opportunity to try the Clifton Heritage Men's Round Neck T-Shirt with Stripe Binding On The Neck and Sleeve and it is ‚Ä¶interesting.  To begin, it is 100% polyester so it just look and feels different.  It came out of the package looking wrinkled and looks like it will remain that way even after washing.  It also feels different from cotton t-shirts which takes some getting used to.  It‚Äôs light and a bit translucent when you hold it up to the light.  Having said that, it‚Äôs not uncomfortable- just different. My husband says he does not ever remember having an all polyester tshirt before.<br /><br />In terms of quality and fit, it is a solid shirt.  The sizing is about right- my husband (5‚Äô8, 165 lbs) has the large and it is a bit roomy which is what he likes. The stripes around the neck and sleeve ends seem superfluous- they don‚Äôt add anything but they don‚Äôt really detract either as they are hardly noticeable. The overall quality is ok- it will not last forever but it should be good for a few years of wear in a regular rotation of shirts.  Last note- it looks like this just comes in plum- not that it is a bad color- it is really nice but if you wanted variety, it does not seem to be available yet.  The Amazon page also does not price it out so I can‚Äôt comment on pricing."
3.0,"It works, it does protects the watch glass surface, it does fog up occasionally. Not a perfect fit."
3.0,"Un poquito desahogado, para mi talla seria mejor si te gusta k te quede ce√±ido xs."
3.0,Wish the cup size was bigger .
3.0,"This product fits my decision/worry coin perfectly.<br /><br />However, it‚Äôs clearly a product made from leather dust that‚Äôs been pressed together with resins and glue. Even thought it has properties of leather, it straight up feels like plastic.<br /><br />It also has a huge ugly logo stamped on the back side."
3.0,"I liked the design, but the gems are constantly coming unscrewed and I've lost them all within a few weeks. I don't want my piercings to close so I don't want to buy again."
3.0,As pictured. Too heavy for my ears.
3.0,"This is a flat metal, does not show colors as well as the online picture.  Cheaply made.  Low price."
3.0,Pins popped after a few months of wear.
3.0,It's good but i have 2 issues with this watch<br />Firstly it's too thick and heavy for its diameter and size<br />Secondly the light function is useless because it's too dark to see it
3.0,"I cannot see the word clearly, I like the bracelet but the wording is hard to see."
3.0,Its pretty but it's not comfortable at all. It digs into my wrist. I cant even wear it. Not very easy to tighten and loosen with 1 hand.
3.0,The necklace was very short. I have small wrist so that did work out for me.
3.0,Fit too large. I should have ordered a size down from what I expected.
3.0,They have one pocket.  One pocket that will not hold an iPhone 12 completely.  About half the phone sticks out.  I don‚Äôt think it will fall out but I would not trust on a bicycle.
3.0,I was in need of a necklace to match a floral dress and this worked well.  The three stars are for the poor quality of the chain.  I used a different chain.  One gets what they pay for!
3.0,"I bought this because I'll buy ANY bra in my size this cheap (and also the matching panties weren't $30 or something dumb) but this is one of the most unflattering bras I've ever bought. my boobs aren't lifted in the slightest, and the black band rolls UP! Also, the color is definitely peach, not pink."
3.0,The sweatshirt was too short and outfit was on the small side. Once washed was even smaller. Only was able to wear once.
3.0,Did not like the chain at all though the pendant is ok.
3.0,Wanted this for part of a homemade costume for Halloween. Doesn't even button for me.
3.0,"Sizing is not consistent. Some fit me great, while others were too tight."
3.0,The fish came like this.
3.0,"very cute little playsuit, fits lightly large."
3.0,Clasp did not hold up
3.0,I think that the fit is off; definitely go a size up!
3.0,"This dress was way too small, especially in the chest. I read a lot of reviews and gathered I should order a size small by what fit others. For reference, I am 5'6, 115 pounds and 34 B bra. I am surprised it was so tight fitting. Style and print are cute, would be a flattering dress in a bigger size but I am afraid even a medium may be too small."
3.0,Does not sit on your head properly
3.0,Not as full as I wooulkd have wanted
3.0,Cute and colorful with great feel BUT not holding up to well. Stitching is coming out.
3.0,I live the fit of the dress and the cut of the dress. But this white is so see through. I expected the fabric to be thicker.
3.0,I like the style and color but fits a little small.
3.0,Nice looking but really do not care for the small cord tied in front. Fit is a touch snug. Purchased two pair will probably not get any more.
3.0,This suit came super fast which was excellent because I had to return it and get a new one in time. The shirt fit perfectly for my 9 year old who is tall and slender but everything else was way too big. The jacket was 2 sizes too big.. and didn‚Äôt match the fit of the shirt. I ordered a size smaller hopefully this one will work.
3.0,"Thin compared to other harness. It's basically stretchy fabric cut into lines, not very sturdy. I'll still wear it."
3.0,"I liked the concept of fine jewelry with a purpose, but this bracelet was WAY too small to fit over my hand.  This might be great for teenagers or people with small hands, but for people with Arthritis or 'man-hands', it simply does not work.  :(. Ashley Bridget does have a bracelet that is open - and that one fits - though it is not as nice as a properly fitting bangle."
3.0,Looked good but didn‚Äôt last. It broke easily
3.0,"They look pretty, but for some reason, fit a little small, and sliding. Not really comfortable. The sticky area will feel hot and my foot skin feel sweats from that."
3.0,Neck tie in back hurts after a few minutes
3.0,"Shirts are really cute, and great for the price! They were a little bit of a boxy shape though so keep that in mind when purchasing."
3.0,"These shoes are comfortable for the price, I don't imagine I will be wearing them all day at work or anything but they are cute for wearing around on my day off."
3.0,They weren't long enough to go over my knees.
3.0,I ordered a 2x and received a large so it did not fit.  Luckily it did fit my granddaughter so she has it
3.0,Good compression. But didnt ultimately work because it made my ankles swell more. Needed ones that went down below ankle
3.0,The band is rubbery and more orange than brown.
3.0,"I liked the feel of these underwear, and they didnt ride up. But they dont last long. I had them maybe 2 months and all 4 have giant holes in the groin area."
3.0,each color fit differently runs 1-2 sizes smaller
3.0,Average quality.  I should of paid closer attention to the detail.  Appears to be smaller from the picture.
3.0,Way to light for my caramel skin lol
3.0,"I am sorry to write this as a review. I cannot find the ‚Äúcontact seller‚Äù spot. However, the earrings are beautiful and I do love them but the second largest set came with only one‚Ä¶ and of course the 2 largest sets are the ones I needed."
3.0,"I haven't had a chance to test their warmth yet, but I'm skeptical because I have Raynaud's Syndrome and require very warm hand wear. Also, the sizing is misleading. They are rated one size fits all. I don't have big hands or long fingers, and my fingertips come up to the very top of mittens. The thumb, however, is a little too long. Once I've had a chance to wear them, I'll make the decision whether to keep or return them."
3.0,These are pretty firm but they help my Dr. Marten chelsea boots (half size too big) fit to the curve of my feet better.
3.0,"I expected better quality. Use movado for many years, others bands are better than smart movado 2"
3.0,Less than I expected. Photo not truly indicative of product.
3.0,They run pretty loose
3.0,"It was ok, a little wide. Fit bigger and longer than expected, but the color and material were nice."
3.0,"These are cute, but extremely small--at least 3 sizes. I ordered a kids size 2/3, and it is roughly the size of a Toddler size 12."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress so much, but I just can‚Äôt get over the ruffles on the ‚Äúsleeve‚Äù, they sit straight up. I don‚Äôt even believe ironing them will keep them down. The material is great, not sheer or see through at all and is good quality. If you love ruffles at the sleeve, this dress is perfect for you! I have very narrow shoulders and this one just looked funny on me."
3.0,Nicely made but runs very small!!
3.0,Very pretty but one of them already broke. The tassel came off the butterfly.
3.0,"These are a great concept, the shape is very interesting.  You don't see many earrings that look this good.  But the color black means these will get lost on a persons face.  I'm looking for my gold paint now.  At least help me keep up my crafts skills."
3.0,"Very adorable, cute color, cut and material, but terrible sizing. I ended up giving the shirt to a family member that it fit on. Would love to get it again, but I'm worried it won't fit again."
3.0,"Cute mask, but it's nearly impossible to see out of the nose holes and breathing is difficult after 2 minutes. I cut a few more holes in the mask, hopefully this will help with both issues..."
3.0,"The material and design are absolutely gorgeous, but the small fit more like an XXS.  Really upset bc like I said, it's beautiful, but will have to go back."
3.0,I love the bra but it's alittle uncomfortable.  Does give good life but the shoulder straps are hurt a bit. Probably would get a cup and band size up next time.
3.0,This jacket was almost perfect. The material is lightweight cotton. The zipper is a little hard to get connected. The fit is a little off. The arms and shoulders are a little snug. It was a little pricey but hard to find this style of jacket. Most are work jackets and I wanted to get away from that look.
3.0,The dress knot happens to be more in the middle vs on the side so I just need to watch that I'm not flashing people. I tend to wear this more at home.
3.0,They stretch out a lot after the first wear.
3.0,The bracelet is nice but the hair band provided<br />is very very loose on it.
3.0,I'm well endowed somewhat... But bust area is loose fitting
3.0,"I was pleased to find a size XXs that actually was small enough, however I had to return because I had problems with the zipper and it was larger on the bottom in the hip area than I liked.  It was a very attractive dress, just not on me and shipping was fast.  I would order from this company again."
3.0,For women with large tatas they will be even more sexy because the buttons pop loose easy.
3.0,Nice bibs however it was coming apart at a seam in the leg had to sew it back up. It arrived that way
3.0,Good quality .. not premium item as it should be ..
3.0,"I really liked this head piece but I was looking for some color in addition to the black because I was trying to match a black and red dress.  So, I returned this product and ended up buying two other items and putting them together to make what I wanted."
3.0,This was pretty short and boxy. Ok to wear around the house tho.
3.0,A bit large but ok with me.
3.0,It's odd - this isn't nearly as loose fitting and flowing as the product advertised as &#34;Casual T-Shirt Sleeveless Swing&#34; and the fabric's thinner and cheaper and pills easily.
3.0,One size fits all didn‚Äôt fit my head but it did my wife and she likes it.
3.0,"Beautiful dress, but it's a bit tight in the bust area."
3.0,They'd be better a little wider to stay cool longer
3.0,"Very soft, for any age."
3.0,Bought large but still fit very tightly. I usually wear medium
3.0,"Very soft, but runs a little small, ordered my daughter a medium, she should wear a small, it fits like a small."
3.0,The stones were not well placed in the piece..
3.0,Pretty color but thin. Elastic at bottom seems tight but maybe after wearing it will feel like a better fit.
3.0,Returning. Not flattering and cheap material
3.0,"I'll start off this review by saying that I didn't end up caring for how this dress fit.  The description stated that the waist seam fell at the &quot;natural waist&quot;, but I found that to be incorrect in my case.  (Which is the primary reason I'm docking the stars.  That description might need reexamined).<br /><br />I'm pretty short-waisted, so it surprised me when the seam actually fell 1.5-2 inches above my naturual wasit-line.  It pretty much hit the bottom the bottom of my bra line and then promptly flared out into the skirt.  I didn't care of the overall look this produced.<br /><br />Aside from that, the make of the overall product was fantastic.  The fabric is on the heavier side, which was not a problem in my case.  I do wish they would specify what type of fabric you're dealing with, however, because I believe you could really throw this in the washing machine instead of doing &quot;dry clean only&quot; like they specify.  I typically wear a size 10 or a medium in dresses, so that's what I ordered here which was great.  The belt is slightly flimsy in construction, but that can be easily changed out for something else.<br /><br />Overall, a nicely constructed and very cute dress if you're looking for the very bell-shaped vintage style.  Just beware that the &quot;natural waist&quot; description might not be 100% accurate."
3.0,Just the head and tail
3.0,Not very good quality if you pull the string some just broke.
3.0,"Wish they came a little organized, instead of just thrown all together in a zip baggie.  But the product seems good so far."
3.0,"I mean, it look's cute and all. But it doesn't really look like a nebula or space. There's hardly any stars and just looks like a bunch of pink clouds."
3.0,It's a little ackward wearing it because it is so large - but it looks cool so i guess it does what its suppose to.
3.0,"The frames are somewhat wide for a slender face. The nose bridge is uncomfortable so I will be looking for some type of padding as it grates on the bridge of your nose. Cute, but uncomfortable."
3.0,The shirt was too big and loose from the shoulders.  Bought a large and did not fit snug enough
3.0,When my son took the pants out of the package there were large fabric strings hanging off of the pants. Was displeased with having to cut strings off of brand new pants
3.0,They had Christmas candy on a halloween mask which clearly indicated the makers of this are not aware of things relating to Christmas and those relating to Halloween.  We do not put Christmas candy on Halloween masks nor do we put ghosts on Christmas masks.
3.0,The colors are off and it's not very sturdy at all. It looks similar but that's it. Also the mickey chain is like foam and it's white not silver. It's a base to build ontop of basically.
3.0,"..this is just too short and I'm not even tall, if I was large breasted this probably wouldn't cover the bottom of my breasts. It's lined and everything is finished off nicely too bad they didn't make it a little longer. It's one of those shirts that the hood is just an oval, looks strange to me.  Not sure of the price but for me I think I'd send it back. I'm sorry I didn't like it  because it's well made and I like the fabric too."
3.0,Comfortable but not tapered in the waist as shown. The color was definitely off from the picture but maybe with several washes it will get better.
3.0,"lovely and well made but tiny, more for a child than an adult"
3.0,Cute ears but tail wasn&#34;t easy to get to stay wear you wanted it
3.0,The dress is shear. More like a swim suit cover up than a dress. Disappointed.
3.0,got rusty quickly but got a lot of compliments.
3.0,"It's ok for the price. I'm 5'6 and 120 pounds. Ordered a large and it's not as loose as I hoped it would be. If you are taller than me, it will be too short to wear as a dress. Material is somewhat weird, it's stretchy and not as flowy as a picture"
3.0,Is very loose especially for people with smaller upper body.
3.0,Cheaply made but the item is not that bad.
3.0,Did not realize you needed adapters
3.0,"Got complimented immediately by my mother who decided I look good in hats. I find it a bit small as a cap, but worth the price tag and something I will wear. I would like glitter on the flowers as it appears to be just a hint of glitter now. Great girl cap!"
3.0,If your a 34 waistline get a medium not a large first wash the pull string fell apart
3.0,"The actual fabric and style of this suit is really nice, but the size is just too small. I wear a  size 8, sometimes a 6, so I ordered the Medium as the size chart indicates. The actual product is at least 1 size too small. Be sure if your ordering to size up 1 to 2 sizes."
3.0,Good product but they run small
3.0,Much smaller and less fluffy than the photos. Okay for the price!
3.0,"Really cute but kind of impossible to put on yourself as a septum ring unless you have super limber tiny fingers of steel.  I have given up on trying to wear for now but, it IS cute so may try again in future."
3.0,"awesome pants, but good grief, you have to be 6' tall to wear them."
3.0,Its ok product as described. It did take a long time for delivery wanted to cancel but it was very inexpensive. Have to check where its made will decide then to buy again. ( not a made in china fan ) sorry  thank you
3.0,Sturdy frame but they are just a bit smaller than I expected.
3.0,Fits too small height wise. I'm not a tall person 5'3 but this did not fit well at all. Elastic was stretched out as well.
3.0,"I bought this in size L for a Halloween costume and was so excited to receive it.  I read lots of reviews and made sure to measure to make sure it would fit, and sadly it was too small. I couldn't fit it over my booty (and I know I have a booty, but I made sure to measure and it still didn't fit).  Luckily I can sew so I was able to remove the zipper and add a piece of fabric that covered my bum and added an elastic band on the top to stretch over my bum. The skirt is not stretchy so make sure you get the right size! I'm 5'6"" and about 170lbs - I was 6 months postpartum at the time so I know my hips have changed a bit, buuutttt again that's why I measured.<br /><br />No minus it not fitting, the product is well made and really pretty :) I liked the tail and sequins on the skirt! It did complete the costume very well and I enjoyed all the trick or treaters getting excited that Ariel was passing out their candy."
3.0,The fabric isn't super comfortable but it isn't terrible. Make sure your first wash is with the pockets turned out because it had lots of fabric fluff.
3.0,"Loved the material and pattern, ordered a small and way to big."
3.0,Pretty dress. I ordered a medium and it was a little big. I usually order a medium. Returns the dress.
3.0,Very pretty lace.. I ordered a large... I'm a medium in tops and it definitely it's very snug... runs small in size
3.0,Flimsy‚Ä¶ not strong like another pair I got from clic. Get what you pay for.
3.0,I need to send this item back please let me know where to send. It does not fit. Thank you.
3.0,"Cute dress, disappointed it ran small"
3.0,I wore this for about a week and all the rhinestones started falling out. Not just one or two....a lot!!! I loved it but didn‚Äôt hold up well
3.0,"These look great, however they run small. I bought a large for my son and a xxl for my husband. The xxl fits my son perfectly. He has always worn a large. The sizes are way off"
3.0,"The top was pretty, but was tight overall.  I ordered a large, which is what I normally wear and it was not a comfortable fit.  I would've ordered a larger size, but it just didn't work for what I had planned, so I returned it."
3.0,Sports bra runs small with stiff styrofoam padding that I removed. It‚Äôs snug but I ended up keeping it to keep the girls in place.
3.0,"This is a really, really beautiful ring. Very shiny and sparkly. Also very comfortable to wear. It arrived way earlier than expected and came in a nice little box.  I ordered his ring for myself, because I do a lot of things outdoors and I wanted a ring that can keep up with that, without spending a fortune. So this is definitely it! I honestly cant get over the the sparkle of the stones. So very pretty! I had the chance to purchase this ring at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review.<br />Update: 7/23/16 as of two weeks ago, one stone after another kept falling out! So the ring lasted about a good month. It still looks good (the metal) but its unacceptable, that the stones keep falling out that soon, if at all!"
3.0,"I bought an XL. The top runs a little on the small side. It fits but is more snug than I like for a casual shirt. Also, I thought the cheetah print had a tan background which would have been much more to my liking. Instead it has a pink background, if I had known those two things, small for an XL and pink background, I would not have bought the shirt. As it is, I did and I'm not going to return it. Maybe one of my friends will like it more than I do."
3.0,The smaller gauges are NOT internally threaded. The threads also could be done better with a higher tolerance.
3.0,Some of them had raw edges.
3.0,"I love the look, but it stopped working Within about two months. I will replace the battery so it's not that big of a deal"
3.0,The bird print dress is very kitschy cute. I'm not sure who can pull this off other than a children's librarian.
3.0,Headband broke immediately. Outfit itself was a very tight fit.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:fe7e18963bb209a6f58c44ca37242181]] First things first: The sizing. This is really small! I am a 5'2"", 36B, 160ish lbs and US Medium. This fits like a Large to me and definitely will not fit an XXL lady. The length was fine because this is right above my knees, being 5'2"".<br /><br />I don't know why it's sold as a PJ, it looks like a summer dress. Material is thick, stretchy. I think I received something that is defective because it seems weird, check out video to understand why I think it's defective or not done."
3.0,"To be honest, I bought this watch without looking at the brand. I usually buy Fossil and I saw this watch thinking ""Well that looks different!""<br /><br />The packaging was pretty good. The watch seems to have pretty decent build quality. This is my first day wearing it so I am not sure of longevity. My only complaint is that the.. we'll call it a pendulum for winding is noisy compared to a Fossil. So far that's my only complaint.<br /><br />The watch does look good. For the money, the build quality, the style is there. I'm okay with the slightly smaller wristband. I get what other people are saying about it. It's not so small that it's a problem for me.<br /><br />Update: I did end up returning this. After another couple of days I was still questioning this purchase, still doubting. The final decision to return was over the quality of the bonded leather. I've adjusted the rating to 3 out of 5 stars. It had a pretty decent build quality but it just wasn't right for me in the long run."
3.0,"Boots are great, but heavy. Good for heavy beating and use for sure!"
3.0,My son wore this for about a month and the piece that holds the band together broke. I reached out to have a replacement sent. They did end up sending one but it took about a week of emails explaining and sending pictures before they were convinced to send a replacement. Will update if second band lasts longer.
3.0,Could have been nice if cut fuller and a bit longer. Nice material. 2xl too small. I‚Äôm usually a 14-16.
3.0,My size is large but this seems to run a little small.  I couldn't wear anything bulky under it.  It had a lot of strings that needed trimming.  I find it seems small through the hip area too.  It closure hangs a little diagonally on me instead of straight up and down.  The fleece is not fluffy it closer to a blizzard fleece.
3.0,"These are perfect for sleeping, but not ideal for working out. They don‚Äôt provide the necessary support for intense excercise.  I do like the inserts that provide a smooth outward appearance. The patterns and colors are true to form."
3.0,My grandmother loved her gift for Mother‚Äôs Day !
3.0,a nice watch for the price
3.0,"The length is shorter than the average crop top, and a bit shorter than pictured. Nice, thick fabric."
3.0,"I've bought about 15 pairs of these as I gained and lost weight the past few years. When they fit, I love them. The problem is the sizing is wildly inconsistent. I once had a large, 1x, and 2x that all fit. I've ordered 3 colors the same size and none of them fit the same way. And yes, I can and have returned them, but it just becomes a chore."
3.0,"Lovely backpack, but it has no water bottle holder."
3.0,Nice shirt. It was thinner than expected and fit too snug for me.
3.0,"I like almost everything about this....the fit is good, the length great, the print feminine without silliness. Unfortunately even the bodice area is so sheer that it's impossible to wear.....I can literally see through both panels when held to light. The privacy bodice isn't substantial enough."
3.0,"Pros: Looks better; more ""grown up"" vibe<br /><br />Cons: Not as good of quality as the original. One of the bands started to tear within the first week where the unit enters the band. Didn't feel comfortable using it any further."
3.0,Go up a size if you buy these.
3.0,"I‚Äôm a rather large chested person (but not the largest out there of course) and I was looking for the most supportive sports bra ever without having to pay 3 months salary for it so I came here.<br />These are not that supportive<br />If I jump, still afraid of getting hit in the face and that‚Äôs not what you want from your ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù bra.<br />The colors are cute though!<br /><br />Also the inserts keep folding and getting mis-shapen‚Äî luckily there is a hole on the side of each cup to easily fix it"
3.0,beautiful but the second one I ordered to match the first one came in broken
3.0,The bag is a great size and shape.<br />I was a little disappointed in the cheap material. It came to me with a scratch on it.<br />It‚Äôs lightweight which I appreciate for my sore muscles!!
3.0,"I ordered this because I love the pattern so much, but the material is kind of cheap looking, and the fit is tight across the chest."
3.0,"3 stars only because:<br />- it's quite short. A bit too short really, so for outdoor shades (that by definition are installed above the windows/  french doors...), this is a bit too short<br />- it's a bit squeaky. I'll need to put some kind of grease under the plastic parts and the rod.<br />- the ""crank"" offset, i.e. how far one hand is from the axis of the rod, is quite small too. So you have less torque, and you need to put more effort to move the shades.<br /><br />Other than that, the positive point (but maybe creating squeaks) is that the handle can extend fully straight, and be moved in a cranking position very easily."
3.0,"Husband loves the style, feel, fit, etc, but the waistband started unraveling pretty bad after not too many wears. Would be willing to give new ones another chance, though."
3.0,"Everyone keeps telling me how cute this shirt is.  I work in mental health, my patients love when I wear this shirt. It's adorable,  you're not too hot or cold in it.  It's just right,  you don't feel like you're wearing anything really, it's so lightweight.  I love my shirt, it fit perfectly as well.  It hasn't shrunk on me yet.<br /><br />Update: The shirt is a massive magnet for anything to cling to it. After washing it a few times whatever else is in that machine clings to this shirt. The paws have started to peel off now. Not the best quality long term.  Have taken off 2 stars for that."
3.0,The nose clip worked great for a few minutes until it slipped off and was lost in the pool. Googles are great though.
3.0,"The material feels weird, but I guess that's how they're supposed to be? I thiught it woyld be thinner and more regular socks like"
3.0,These are OK. Comfortable.
3.0,Nicely packaged.<br />Not impressed. It had all the looks of a Coach bag;<br />But did not feel like  a Coach bag.
3.0,"Thought it would be more silky, but it's nice and fits."
3.0,Runs way big. I normally wear a Medium too when not prego. I ordered a small as maternity clothes can sometimes run larger..This was like 2 sizes too big in the bust area. Definitely comfy but runs really big in chest tummy area even for maternity.
3.0,Runs small bought a medium fits like a small
3.0,"I really loved this necklace. I loved the look and that it was actually very light weight. However, as soon as I picked it up to put it on, it broke. ‚òπÔ∏è"
3.0,"This appeared to be identical to my previous insert but when I transferred my cards from the previous insert, some didn't fit in the new one.  I had to trim some down."
3.0,I'm 5'4&#34; and this dress is a little short on me (size medium). Otherwise I like it. I just wish it was longer.
3.0,"Looked good on, but the chain broke the first and only time it was worn."
3.0,"I received the wrong dress, I decided to try it on anyways and it did not like my short body, I am only 5 foot 1...it didn't drag on the floor but a medium was was to loose.  I am 146 pounds. Returning tomorrow."
3.0,Looks legit from far away. The stones look pretty fake once you get close.
3.0,"The material is great, soft and lovely. The length is perfect, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and it falls at mid calf for me but unfortunately the wait band is so small! I‚Äôm usually a 28 in pants but this skirt was cutting my circulation, it‚Äôs definitely not a once size fits all. I was sad to return it because like I said, it‚Äôs a well made and lovely skirt but it‚Äôs just too small at the waist"
3.0,Got these for me because im on my phone a bit too much but they were to strong for me so i gave them to my mom and she says theyre great
3.0,"This vest is okay. Mot my favorite purchase, in the pics advertised it looks like it will be more ""dressy"" but it's more of a look to wear with leggings on a Sunday."
3.0,I am 5'3 138 pounds and I got a size small. Fits a little snug in the breast area but overall good for the price. It is more of a printed cheap material shirt than what I had expected. It is a cheap spandex material .I got compliments at the concert on the kissing skeletons.
3.0,"Cheap, stretchy skirt. Way shorter than anticipated but you get what you pay for!"
3.0,This mask is hard against the face
3.0,These bleed! Do not wash with light colors
3.0,"I bought both the Yukon Expedition Crew and the Chocorua Midweight Crew for my husband. The Chocorua was $48 and the Expedition $82 at the time. The Expedition was a bit heavier, however the Chocorua had a very nice weight and feel to it. I also thought the cut of the Chocorua was a bit more flattering. This one looked a bit boxier. For the price difference, the Chocorua seemed like a better deal. We ended up sending the Expedition back.  My husband has owned the Chocorua for a year now without one complaint."
3.0,This umbrella might be good for shielding the sun but not functional for a rainy day or wind.<br />Very small.
3.0,Judging just off the face of the watch it was great. Just remember to set it every morning. The band however was cheap and the vinyl came apart the first day. So a mixed review on this. I thought the fasteners would have held the small piece of vinyl to the face but it came off immediately.
3.0,"An XL usually fits me fine. These are mighty skinny, though I was able to squeeze into them, and they are considerably longer than average. They are pretty and the fabric is nice but I worry about longevity, given that I'm stretching the fabric more than I would like."
3.0,I normally wear large blouses. I got x-lg size and it is still very tight on my ribs. too uncomfortable to wear very long. gives a nice bust lift and some posture support.
3.0,The waistband runs small compared the the rest of the jean. Nice quality but just to small.
3.0,"I wear thong underwear all the time but these were uncomfortable.  Still unsure why, size, cut, whatever, but have not purchased anymore.  The stitching, material, and embroidering were good but personally would not purchase again."
3.0,"Cute shoes, but really cheap.. They didn't last more than a handful of wears."
3.0,"Adorable dress , had a small rip in the seem under the arm."
3.0,"The white was too see through for the family picture I planned, thin material kind of clingy"
3.0,Runs small. Material is scratchy and not very appealing but colors are as pictured.
3.0,"Small, I have a 34D ordered a medium and it doesn't fit in the bust and is small in the shoulders."
3.0,Lovely colours
3.0,The post are really long they poke my neck behind my ear
3.0,"really really liked it, but within 6 weeks turned my finger green and the ring discolored to black.<br />Get what ya pay for I guess..SIGH.."
3.0,"I bought a size 10 but it fits more like a size 8, the tag was cut out when it arrived so I can't tell if it's really a size 10. Probably go up a size when ordering."
3.0,"The frame and hinges are too flimsy for the price. I have bought cheaper glasses with better construction. Not absolutely terrible, just too expensive for such low quality."
3.0,Fits a little too bit around the bottom. Different type of fit. 158 at 5'1
3.0,With metal chain should have tipped me off... plactic watch.... very cheaply made.
3.0,"Thinner than expected, but comfy."
3.0,"No es tan grande como aparece en la foto, sin embargo e sbonita"
3.0,The dress I ordered was NOT the dress delivered.  The top of the dress was more of a wrap top.
3.0,"the quality is great, but the sizing runs small, I ordered a 2X to have some extra room and it is just not there."
3.0,Loved the bead. Only reason not 5 stars was because of price.
3.0,Raiders suck
3.0,"The bracelet was ok, but I ordered the size I needed and it was too small.  Also, the bracelet itself is kind of thin.  Was expecting it to me a thicker and smoother."
3.0,"It fit fine as far as sizing waist/bust goes, but for someone my height (5' 10&#34;) it was definitely a cheeky show! I returned it because it would've made for an awkward shirt and the material was just not what I thought it would be, it definitely has a workout type material."
3.0,"It would‚Äôve been cute if it was longer. There was no way I could wear it, it showed EVERYTHING lol. For reference I ordered a medium and I‚Äôm 5‚Äù and 130 pounds."
3.0,These slippers ran small.  They are definitely a nonskid product and would work well for safety.  I would order a size up if interested.
3.0,Some way smaller than expected. I have not wore them yet
3.0,Not impressed very flexible souls no support really
3.0,"I bought this product for my wife.  She took a look at it and liked the design and style online.  When it arrived it looked completely different then the picture posted online.  The sleeves don't flow down like they do in the pic.  In fact, they're pretty short. And the bottom of the shirt is a lot shorter than expected.  The wife still wears it but it's pretty much a pajama shirt than what it was intended for (i.e. a shirt to wear out)."
3.0,These attach well but are a little to short for me. Usable but marginal.
3.0,The Jean's are beautiful but do not fit even though I choose the European size as directed.
3.0,Uncomfortable but that‚Äôs to be expected
3.0,"Made of a thicker material than I expected, but will do the job well enough. Smells funny..."
3.0,"When they say skinny they aren't joking.  These are TIGHT.  I'm 5'3&#34; 115 lbs and it's a bit of a struggle to get into these, but still doable.  If you're a curvy girl or over 215 lbs I would not recommend these at all.I feel like some of the holes were done kind of half-assed and didn't even register so I had to take a pair of scissors to them to make them more noticeable.  All in all kinda meh."
3.0,Not true to size...didn't have lace at neck like pictured...material is soft...but not worth the price
3.0,"This fit as I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù, usually a size 14, 36C, and got the XL and it fit fine. Some reviews said the arms were short but they were normal on the one I received. There was just something awkward about the over all cut of this, but the strangest thing was the double hood! I got the black and white stripe with black floral and there are TWO hoods showing both prints. This would be ok if they were sewn together but they‚Äôre loose just flopping around.  I couldn‚Äôt deal with that even for the two minutes I tried it on, so I returned it."
3.0,"I like the look, but the sleeves are too tight...seems like I would need a next size up"
3.0,"TOO SMALL , I GAVE THEM AWAY SINCE THEY CAME FROM CHINA."
3.0,Love the boots. I get a lot of compliments on them. My only complaint is that they have that plastic smell and you can‚Äôt get rid of it. So a lot of people tell me great boots but you smell like rubber.
3.0,hard to keep from wrinkling because material is so thin.
3.0,"They are a little to big and will not stay on my daughter's shoulder. I bought a 4t her size, I would recommend buying 1 size smaller than your child. Has washed well and didn't shrink. I would buy again."
3.0,"Clips dug into skin, but they served their purpose on short notice."
3.0,The material seems nice and soft but it is very clingy and runs small. I would suggest to size up unless you don't mind it on the tight fitting side.
3.0,Bought the belt for my bf who wears his belt below his belly.  I think he just pulls it too tight as what happened is where you put one end of the belt into the teeth and lock that down it keeps ripping off and he ended up doing this 4 times before I finally said let's just send it back.
3.0,Nice little cheap glasses to take on vacation and not have to worry about losing them.
3.0,Kind of thin and cheaply made
3.0,"This feels nice and seems like it will hold up, but didn‚Äôt work for my small wrists. Too much magnet strap left over and makes it look weird.<br />Returned."
3.0,Need to buy one more number. It fit very tight. But is a nice dress. Looks better in the model.
3.0,Cute bag but fell apart rather quickly after several weeks of use. Did not smell as other reviews noted. The color is pretty but I wish it held up longer.
3.0,"Dress looks better online. Very, very long. Had to return it."
3.0,Super long hemming. Everything else fit pretty great
3.0,Brigth yellow!!!!!
3.0,"After asking others who purchased these earrings if the simulated moonstone looked plastic or not and they said it looked authentic, I bought a pair.  I was going to give these as a gift to someone but am keeping them for myself because I feel that the moonstone looks totally plastic compared to genuine moonstone pieces I already have.  The silverwork and garnet is very lovely but the moonstone, notsomuch.  I wouldn't give these as a gift but they're okay for myself."
3.0,"Material and designs are great. But I have a very slender 10 year old son. He wears a size 8 brief in almost every brand, so I bought the M 8-10. They‚Äôre way too large for his waist."
3.0,Will serve its purpose.
3.0,"The fabric was nice and it looked just like picture, but it ran a little small"
3.0,"As always a good quality hat from Tilley.  However, I ordered a tan hat, its very green.  The tag on the hat said TAN, but the hat is very green."
3.0,"These are extremely comfortable compression socks.  I would give them 5 stars save that the soles and toes simply do not last.  I‚Äôve purchased multiples of these of the last year, and about 25% of the socks have worn through.  It‚Äôs too bad."
3.0,"Quality control check needs upped!<br /> The shirt has a black stain under the armpit  looks like a screen print oops from when it was made.<br />Shirt runs a little small.  Order up unless you plan to only air dry it.<br />He loves the shirt though so, I‚Äôm ordering another.  Fingers crossed it‚Äôs free of any defects."
3.0,Product proportion are not as appears in the photo.
3.0,"Nice color (burgundy) but the shirt is shorter than I expected.  I wear medium, ordered a medium, but it's a little bit short; otherwise fits true to size."
3.0,"The color is gorgeous (the electric blue)  The material is thick, warm and soft.  I really, REALLY wanted to love this sweater, but it just didn't work for me. It's huge, (I'm a size 4 - 34A, almost 5'5&#34; and 140lbs) but I could have looked past the size if not for the cowl.  Cowls are notoriously fussy anyway, but this one specifically is miserable.  Not matter what I did, I could NOT get it to lay right.  There are two seams on the inside of the cowl and no matter how much I tried, they were visible. I debated on keeping it anyway because it really is comfortable. and the high/low hem was really cute, but I knew that I was just not wear it because of the stupid cowl.  If not for it, this sweater is a solid 4 stars even being ginormous."
3.0,"This is not really a review, but I needed to find a way to ask a question about this item.  Can you please post the length of the necklace.  I have to get necklaces that are at least 22 inches - 24 inches long.  Please post the length of the necklace."
3.0,"Good product, strong magnet, easy in/out of eyeglass stems; all positive except for the price.  Way overpriced, but I will probably buy another one."
3.0,ok little smaller than expected
3.0,I bought the exact same top about a year ago and liked it then but then decided I wanted one in a different color and when I ordered an xl ( one size bigger than last time) I was disappointed to see it was the same size. The tag say's different but they are the same when held side by side. Also this time there was a small hole under the arm straight out of the package. So the material is a bit cheap but it's good for a work out...at home.
3.0,"Great skirt! The bottom zip downs on the sides make it very roomy, the material is cool and it‚Äôs just a really fun and playful skirt.  It is that loud material though, but it runs true to size.  I‚Äôm normally a large, but ordered a XL just to be safe and it is way too big.  I‚Äôm about 5 ft 5.5 and it hits well past my knees."
3.0,Est√°n muy bonitos me gustaron pero cuando me los probe el primer d√≠a se le salio un Lente üòèü§îdel Lado Esquierda eso ya me desuluociono üòè que penaüòû
3.0,"Pretty colors however, this top is much shorter and form fitting than expected."
3.0,"The slit at the bottom of the dress is in the very center not to one side which is awkward. It doesn't quite line up with the line on the chest of the dress (off by just a few centimeters) which just makes it look poorly sewn. Ok to wear to the park or something but not somewhere nice. Lightweight material is nice though, and not see-through."
3.0,it does not polarize as advertised or good for night driving.
3.0,"These came and are small compared to the size chart. They are also all cotton rather than a blend. I ordered the Happy Camper version. There is an instruction on them that is amusing, and perhaps should be highlighted for those of us in the US who throw most thing in the dryer. ‚ÄúNo drying by turning.‚Äù  I will attach a picture possibly. I assume that means line dry only."
3.0,"I bought four of these in different colors, all in XL. Only one fit as expected, the other three were quite snug. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 159 lbs. sad, was looking forward to these"
3.0,"Love the leggings but be aware they run very small ordered xl should have ordered xxl I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 180lbs, much too tight so I will give to my daughter."
3.0,"at least it's comfortable because i would never actually wear this out in public. unless it's one of those bloater, feel ugly anyway kind of days and i need to pick up pads at the grocery store."
3.0,"The bow on the chest is upside down, the cinched bodice is alot smaller than the photo, and no extra cloth to adjust. Shows alot of cleavage, unfortunately I do not have alot of cleavage to show. The material is like a soft stretchy canvas.  Would have liked it if it was exactly like the photo. But otherwise it is good quality material. I got a large, I believe a medium would have worked even better. May purchase again, now knowing exactly what to expect."
3.0,I had to return these shoes. Really hated to have to do it.  They are so cute! Just didn't fit.
3.0,It is very small. the fabric is nice though.
3.0,They fit very slim. Almost don‚Äôt fit at all. I have To shove my feet into them. Still cute though.
3.0,"These are ok but very thin visor and the spiral in the back is very thin as well.  I would say they do what they are supposed to do but I wouldn't want a gust of wind to come up.  It would be gone.  I have others like this and they are much thicker and stronger spiral in the back.  Wear those all the time but wanted to get some new ones.  These doubt these will last.  Also, black, white, and beige are standard colors which is what I wear most and there is no selection of colors which disappointed.  I thought there would be at lease one black from what I read, but there was none."
3.0,"I ended up using my hands and folding the removable cups into the bra than using this tricky tool. Still kept it in case it actually becomes useful. For now, it‚Äôs just collecting dust."
3.0,Way shorter than described
3.0,"this dress wasn't flattering on my short frame. it looked like a tent and the belt really didn't help. i'm a curvy gal, pear shaped, 155lbs, 5 foot tall, normaly size 12. it didn't fit me or look anything like the picture on me. it was almost floor length and the cut of this dress doesn't work like that. I would say you need to be 5'5&#34; or taller for this to flatter. The material is thick and stretchy like jersey. The top was very boxy on me. Just not a good fit for my size."
3.0,"I ripped them in half with my bare hands. Im not sure if they are supposed to fit at the waist but they looked way better above the belly button, but then they looked like capris. Skin tight capris. not the lazy, cool vibe we were going for."
3.0,"Overall fit is great however I have worn these twice now and the pocket on the back has already ripped so I am bummed about that, I also feel like the stomach support is not the best but I didn‚Äôt think it would be from reading the reviews."
3.0,"I thought this might flow from the body better, but it doesn't. Also, the edges are just rough sewn, not finished seams. Really not worth the price. I think I'd get a similar item just from cutting out a men's regular tee."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter, who has been wanting one since she came across mine a few months ago. I liked this one because it was pretty and not too flashy. However, when we got it and went to put it on, it took forever to figure out. Finally after looking at the picture we realized that it only looks good if your hand is facing down, otherwise you just have a bunch of chains all tangled up and looking kind of silly. It would look much nicer if the chains were more secure, even though that style was what drew me to this set, without thinking of how the chains would hang if your hand wasn't down."
3.0,This is similar fit to a leotard .  The same dip in the front applies to the back as well. Weird for.  Flimsy unstructured material.  I waited too long to return so I wear it underneath  a t shirt for layering.  Not very flattering.  Live and learn
3.0,"So as far as the horns and tail go, this is a nice product. The listing fails to mention or depict clearly that the wings are EXCESSIVELY GLITTERY. So much so that I had to seal the bag shut and there's still red glitter EVERYWHERE. Also, the pitchfork is NOT the same one as pictured at all. It's a cheap flimsy stick with a floppy sequin top. I'm keeping bc I like the horns and tail, but disappointed in the rest."
3.0,I ordered my size and it was kind of big I wear a medium size I'm about 140 lb and I'm five six and it didn't really fit like the picture but I made it work üòä
3.0,"I have a pair of thirty year old Frogskins, so I‚Äôve seen my share of replacement lenses.  Quality wise, these are my least favorite, but they were also the cheapest, so it evens out.  These a physically thinner than my last pair, which was a different brand, but they fit fine and are easy to install.  They are polarized, but not as effective as my other lenses and they sometimes add a weird blue edge to things.  It‚Äôs hard to describe, but you‚Äôll know it when you see it.  My wife‚Äôs cheap glasses had better polarization than these, but I could see fish in the water better than without them.  So in conclusion, if you just need some replacement lenses, these work, but there are better options if you spend a bit more."
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these dresses, one with the black background and blue, purple, and white detail which fit small and after wearing and washing once I needed to repair the top elastic band in about a dozen spots so that dress gets only 1 star.<br /><br />  I also ordered the cream colored one with the orange, pink, and blue detail, this one fit great was comfortable and didn't have any defects so this one gets 5 stars.<br /><br />  It seems to be a hit or miss on the quality and sizing but the dresses were cheap so I really cant complain too much."
3.0,"I ordered these slippers in a size larger than my daughter normally wears so she wouldn‚Äôt grow out of them right away, even in the larger size I couldn‚Äôt get them on her feet, way too small."
3.0,"OMG they stank so bad when my wife opened the package. It was a chemically, pickle, stale, idk how exactly to describe it smell. Straight from the packaging to the washer. If there is anything else after we wash them I will update this."
3.0,It looked better in the photo than in person and there was a strange chemical smell to it.  Might fade with time but was not thrilled enough to keep it.
3.0,Material not that stretchy
3.0,"I am 5'6&#34; 145lbs and a 38D, I ordered the size for band size 38 and it was too big."
3.0,It a little see through.:)
3.0,The fur in the bottom gives them a spongy type feeling that makes adjusting to them difficult. The bottom is not a firm sole.
3.0,"The band did not come with 9 holes, it comes with 7. Not as big as it advertised, so it just barely fits me. Wasn't hard to put on but wasnt easy either. When you slide over the little ball, the whole thing slides into the band so you have to put one side in the hole first. The ""leather"" feels and sounds cheap. I get that you're paying 21 bucks for 2 bands, but this just isnt as advertised. The colors do look nice though like the picture. Not too comfortable right now, but I'm going to wear it for a night and see if I will return them or not."
3.0,Ordered size 6-7 but it‚Äôs got for 5 yr old! Size up plz
3.0,Much smaller than it appears to be
3.0,"This ring is not sterling silver.  It says fashion jewelry and thats what it is.  That being said, its very nice although smaller then average.  I would recommend ordering a size up."
3.0,what I didn't like about this idea is that I would be wearing my watch then all of a sudden it fell off for no reason and yes it was buttoned right. It did this serival times that I finally put my other watch band back on
3.0,"Fit great everywhere but in the bust. If I went a size larger it would fit in the bust but too big everywhere else.<br />Also, the skirt material is heavier than it appears in the picture"
3.0,"This Christmas dress is very cute. I usually wear a 14. This fit, but its very clingy in the tummy/upper hip/back area."
3.0,I like these earrings. Unfortunately one of my came in broken because the shipping packaging was not protective. I just made the other one match the broken one (remove metal feather) and still wore them.
3.0,"I bought these at Payless for about the same price. Probably won't last three whole summer since the velcro is wearing out after 2 months of wearing them 3 to 4 times a week. That being said they are comfortable, allow my toddler to run around with no problems and very quick to put on."
3.0,Bought these for my 5 month old but they are too big. Hoping they'll work later
3.0,Nice top but runs small
3.0,The fabric on this was a little thin. I was expecting something a little bit thicker. It also came with absolutely no directions on how to create the various looks. There was one single tubular piece involved and I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to do with it. It would be helpful if they had a brochure with how to create the various designs as well as how to wear the dress in the best way.
3.0,This bathing suit is so cute however it fit great in the waist and butt but the top is a bit snug. And the halter top tie part could definitely be a little longer. It was fine to wear a couple times but just wasn't too comfy in the top area. The print and material is great. It's a great quality just maybe need to work on the sizing.
3.0,"The vest was very nice, it just wasn't for my man; but easy return!"
3.0,Beautiful dress I wear a size 14 but the xlarge was too small
3.0,The waist elastic twisted the 1st washing. It took awhile to straighten it back. It needs some stitching so its not a everytime thing. Besides that I liked them.
3.0,"The chains connects in the back to form one necklace, the the rose gold is really nice but I doubt it's real lava rock, it took a long time for it to soak up the essential oils and scent didnt last."
3.0,"It appeared stretchy cotton, but it is more like a button up dress shirt material with no give. It was too small and due to shipping cost, they don‚Äôt want  you to return (Your expense anyway) and will only offer 10%-20% refund. Not the practice I‚Äôm used to. Never again and still trying to resolve. Shirt itself is not bad quality, just not what was described."
3.0,The body of the dress fits but the sleeves were too tight. This is perfect for someone with small arms.
3.0,"Cute design. Good colors.  Not as soft as it looks in the picture.  I wear a medium, I ordered an XL due to another shirt very similar that I ordered an xl and it fit perfect . I would say this one is true to size.  It was way too big, so like an xl."
3.0,It‚Äôs great earrings for the time being but will turn your ears green / black overtime (1.2 week)
3.0,Kinda Cheap.
3.0,I have no idea WHAT this even was oe if I got it. The picture doesn't even show the correct product.
3.0,"I'm 145# and 5'6"" and got a medium, which is my normal size.  This shirt fits well, long enough in the back to wear with leggings.  The double hood and buttons on the shoulder add a nice little flair.  The shirt washed and dried well with no special care.  The only problem is that the shirt is very itchy, even when adding a lot of fabric softener in the wash.  I doubt that I will wear it very much unless I have a long sleeve shirt layered underneath.  Only recommend if you understand that the fabric may not be very pleasing."
3.0,"Fits well and super comfy, but took no time for sole fabric to pill and pull away from shoe. Quality lacking."
3.0,Well it works but I have. A few cons the first one it's the button in the screen it's so hard to push to get it on but it works and the second one and most Anoying it's that the thing where it locks hurts your hands specially if u are. A non watch person but we'll at least it works not problem with hours or dates easy to set up
3.0,"It took a very long time for me to receive my order. Over a month. I like the style. They are kinda tight and hurt the side of your head for a little while. I would like to assume this would get better with time, but after about a month of wearing them the lens fell out. I can‚Äôt find it to put it back in so I haven‚Äôt been able to use them."
3.0,"Good basic slipper but runs VERY large.  I wear an 8 1/2 shoe, ordered size L (9-10).  Way too big.  Ordered size M (7-8).  Still too large but I kept them."
3.0,So I bought this item twice<br />The first time I bought it I bought a size 9 it fits but was a bit too tight.<br />I went back and ordered a 9.5 you would expect the 9.5 to be bigger but I think they sent me a smaller ring cause the one they sent can‚Äôt go on my finger at all.<br />Hey still a really nice ring but I wish they would have sent me the correct size
3.0,Too big even on the smallest adjustment  and I wear a 8.5 shoe
3.0,"Nice quality, soft fabric. But they are too big for me. I'm a size 5 in jeans."
3.0,Pretty skirt but runs small in size
3.0,"It's okay but the bottom of the skirt is very hard to walk in its a small opening so short steps, very tight in the waist and huge in the bust. So it's not for my body type lol"
3.0,Way to tight had to give it away to the lady companion not cool
3.0,"I love butterflies, but not this one! Too one sided, it doesn't feel balanced!"
3.0,"The scarf is heavy duty and will definitely keep you warm. It‚Äôs a little ‚Äòplasticky‚Äô, not quite like cashmere or pashmina. It is not reversible, the print is only on one side and the other side is white. The print is bold and bright."
3.0,"The cow was more red than pink and the pants faded after the first wash.  Otherwise, this was a cute outfit."
3.0,"I guess I should have realized how low this is based on the armpit hole and that the straps go below that level.  Otherwise, LOVE the way it crosses and the look but you may want it under something that doesn't go quite as low depending on what you're wearing this for!"
3.0,Strap broke when I washed it in the washing machine 3rd time I washed it. I bought 2 of these so maybe the other one will not break.
3.0,It has a real vintage looks to it it is impressive
3.0,Cute socks but 6-8 youth size was large enough for a man!
3.0,I like it and looks good but I ordered an adult XXlarge and fits more like a medium. Had to return because of size.
3.0,"I wanted to love this so much and in fact I did; until I noticed the top wouldn‚Äôt stay up. (The fabric made it fold over) Then I noticed the strap loops and looked for straps in the bag. The romper comes with clear, plastic straps. In the Texas heat this is the last thing you want; plastic straps melting into your skin. No thanks! I sent it back."
3.0,Belts are more stiff and plastic feeling than I hoped for. Hard to tie a bow to make it look cute.
3.0,The plastic part on the top of the slide will give u a blister and/or cut. They are cute but they will tear up your toes!
3.0,Fell apart and the tail was extremely short.
3.0,Cute shirt but a 2xl and it's still too tight.
3.0,"This is such a cute bathing suit. The top fit well (I‚Äôm 5-4‚Äù, 150lbs, athletic build, 34DD), I didn‚Äôt feel like I was busting out of it, but the bottoms where a little weird. They fit everywhere nicely except the top of myths waist. I felt like they were just a little too tight and pitched me in, causing a bit of a muffin top.  I have a tiny waist so I was surprised by that. I‚Äôm returning, but wish it would have worked. I ordered a large."
3.0,"Son muy bonitos pero estan muy gruesos, si siempre has usado arete de gruesor normal, te va doler usarlos al principio si es que logras hacerlos entrar."
3.0,"Bought this specific bracelet because it was ""hot"" pink, a very bright vivid easy to see pink.<br />Received a pale baby pink that almost blends in with my skin tone."
3.0,"Love the look of this, but when I received it, it had a small stain on it. Decided to keep it as it was a last minute purchase before vacation as I needed a cute dress to wear to a resort 'white' party. Luckily the spot came out. It did shrink but I made it work. The white puff ball things look good in the pic, but not so much in person. I wore it once to the party, but I won't be wearing it again as it seems to have deteriorated after just the first initial wash."
3.0,It‚Äôs beautiful just turning brown again but I‚Äôm in love with the charm replace chain only? and price on a extra chain JUST IN LOVE WITH CHARM please
3.0,Wish it had a better sizing guide.
3.0,"If i compare this with CK, ok quality and runs bit small. I suggest one size larger than CK. It has better quality than cheaper brand."
3.0,This is 100% cotton - I prefer lycra or other materials that don't shrink or fade
3.0,The bracelet was as shown in the picture and I liked it but it was big. You would need to have a very big wrist for it to fit you
3.0,These are very soft but I can feel the no skid dots on the bottom of the socks very well and it makes them a little uncomfortable when walking.
3.0,I like everything except for the chain it was too small and not strong. It looks like it could break too easily!
3.0,bought as a gift love it and its cute just could be a little thicker is all
3.0,"The material is very nice, however the fit is just slightly too small and the front is very short - I had to wear a matching tank top underneath."
3.0,"Wife speaking, I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù with a bust of 32A. It fit me perfectly every, except the bust area. I had to sew it about halfway closed in order for it to be wearable. Still look great! But now it‚Äôs a little hard to put on since I have little to no leeway of getting it over my hips and shoulders."
3.0,"The underskirt on this is a little small, but overall the fit is about true to size (based on having full hips/bottom)."
3.0,"Really cute jacket my daughter loves to wear it, I wasn‚Äôt too happy that it had a stain on it. But didn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of returning during COVID so just kept it and washed it."
3.0,"I love the color of the leggings however they show every bit of sweat. This doesn‚Äôt bother me but I do know a lot of ppl would be put off by it. The fit is great through rear and legs however, on me they are a bit higher waisted than I would like. I still wear them, I just make sure to wear a longer tee with them."
3.0,"Jacket fits a little smaller than the jackets I usually buy at Ross, Marshall‚Äôs or JC Penny‚Äôs."
3.0,Not quite what I expected but they fit and work for me.
3.0,Small bust
3.0,"Not worth the price,  Not constructed well. Looks and feels cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Blocks sweat protects my scalp, does what it is supposed to."
3.0,Cute in the pictures but didn‚Äôt wash up that well. Sizing was off. A bit larger than expected
3.0,"It's great quality and comfortable but doesn't look like the photo, so I was really disappointed."
3.0,"These look great, but have a difficult time staying on. I would try to bend the clap a little more closed, but I'm afraid the metal would break."
3.0,"This dress was way too big for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 4‚Äù and 118 lbs. normally wear a XS/S. Ordered the small as that was the smallest size and it‚Äôs still too big. Also, the colors are different than what is pictured. The pink at the bottom looks more red/coral toned in person which I don‚Äôt love. It‚Äôs just not as cute as it looks online."
3.0,Gems come off easily. Very pretty for show but if your child is actually using a gymnastics bar it is not a leotard that's practical. Fit as expected.
3.0,"Love the shape of the dress but one of the pockets sticks out at the seam and won't lay flat. If you don't mind some seeing imperfections here and there, I would absolutely suggest you check out this dress. If your plan is to wear it to a special occasion or to have a dress delivered to your house that is guaranteed to be perfect this may not be the dress for you. The pockets are just under 5&#34; in depth so the corner of my phone sticks out just a little but nicely weighs down some of the sewing problems in the dress. I found the black dress to be relatively opaque, but I would not try to wear white or a colored/ patterned cami, bra, or underwear under it just to be safe."
3.0,"Not great, but good for the price."
3.0,"Nice looking watch, but slightly smaller in diameter than what I expected. I like a 50mm+ sized case at a minimum. Virtually unreadable in the dark! I have to press the light button several times before the time can be seen. Small dials makes it difficult to see in dark. Light only stays on for 1 second, not allowing eyes to focus in the dark and there is so much reflections, throughout the dial, it is impossible to read. Band is nice looking but small for the larger wrist. I'm 6'4&#34; and the band barely fits. For almost $80 I would expect a better band. Manual is almost 3/4&#34; thick. I would prefer a watch with fewer options and easier to setup. The manual was easy to read and understand but it took about 30 minutes to setup. If the manual is lost it would be impossible to setup."
3.0,These are very thin. I was expecting more of a yoga pant but they aren‚Äôt like that at all.
3.0,Smaller than we expected
3.0,I ordered a size up than normal... it was still too small s very disappointed! I wanted a fun Halloween dress!
3.0,"No me agrada, no se ve la hora en la noche, muy poco luminico."
3.0,just so so....
3.0,"these gloves were purchased for my tree nursery job, hoping for a resilient, water-proof glove to get me through the cold, wet autumn and early winter work days. The touch screen detail is of no consequence in my job performance but in deliberately trying out this option......too cumbersome for me thus a 2 rating. Comfort is top notch....no complaints at all even wearing these gloves for my 8-10 hours shifts. Waterproof is poor in my opinion. Watering trees inside greenhouses in the winter is still wet and cold and these gloves barely kept my hands dry for 2 hours, usually less. For the price i paid i was hoping for a best performance glove but am disappointed. i shall have to look elsewhere."
3.0,"Good service, but these no show socks tend to slip off my foot and that is annoying."
3.0,I ordered the camo but received a plain gray carry on.  My grandson did not like the other and was very upset.  I returned the gray one but I am still looking for a camo carry on.
3.0,I wanted to love this because of the price but it didn‚Äôt fit right. I expected a tighter fit for layering but the sleeves were pretty loose. The neck is super tight as well so it was very uncomfortable.. will sadly be returning.
3.0,"It‚Äôs nice and small like I needed, but didn‚Äôt come with a battery like most clocks do, so that was a bit of a bummer.<br /><br />*Update: I returned it due to no place to actually open and install a battery."
3.0,They didn‚Äôt fit good and not what I wanted!!
3.0,"I was looking for goggles that my soon-to-be 4 year old son can wear during his swim lessons.  He has been taking swim lessons since he was 1.5 years old.  He use to open his eyes in the water but when he turned 3, he started to close his eyes when in the water.  I've been trying to get him to wear goggles but he keeps rejecting them because he complains that they're either too tight or they pull on his hair.  I was attracted to the Ipow goggles because it has an adjustable nose piece and a cute dolphin design.  It's hard to find children goggles with adjustable nose pieces, and my son needs them to be adjustable in order for the goggles to fit properly around his eyes.  However, the adjustable nose piece does not stay in place once you adjust it.  I keep having to readjust it before putting it on my son each time.  Additionally, the head strap doesn't stay in place.  No matter how tight his swim teacher and I try to adjust the head strap, it keeps falling down to my son's neck.  His swim teacher spends half of his 20 minute lessons just trying to get the goggles to fit my son's head.  (I don't see any other kids needing to adjust their goggles this much.)  He has been an expert in rolling over onto his back to float whenever he needs to breath since he turned 2 years old.  Ever since he started wearing these goggles, he seems to struggle with his roll overs to breath.  He would keep rotating his body as if he doesn't know when his body was out of the water.  It turns out that water kept getting into the goggles and he was trying to get water away from his eyes. Water kept getting into the goggles no matter how tight the goggles were adjusted.  At the end of each swim lesson, you can see red marks around his eyes because the goggles were so tight.  The only good thing about these goggles is that, despite its flaws,  my son is willing to wear them because of the cute dolphin design."
3.0,"I really wanted to love these. The material is so soft and light weight but the support is not great and within a few minutes of any activity, the bottom rolls up."
3.0,is a bit for children
3.0,The suit did not fit correctly. The bottom did not fit close like swim wear.
3.0,"The shorts were way too big. They are larger than expected. So definitely try a size smaller than usual. Otherwise, they are pretty cool. Light, plenty of pockets and a nice design."
3.0,"I bought this one because my tried and true sports bra (Champion Women's Shape T-Back Sports Bra, which evidently was discontinued) and this one had good reviews. I wanted to like this bra but it takes a degree of manual dexterity to fasten that I don‚Äôt have. You can‚Äôt fasten it in the front and then pull the clasps around your rib cage to the back (isn‚Äôt that how everyone fastens a bra?). Instead you have to reach around behind like a flexible gymnast and try to line up the clasps because of the cross straps. Or else you need a friend to fasten it for you ( no thanks). I couldn‚Äôt do it. Instead I tried stepping into it and pulling it up over my butt until I can get my arms under the shoulder straps. I have to take it off the same way! If there is an easier way maybe someone can post an instructional video (JK!).In customer Q&a I found this advice which I will try: ‚Äúwrap around your torso with the bra backwards and upside down, fasten the hooks in front, then flip around and stick your arms through.‚Äù I will probably just avoid wearing this bra except when my comfy old discontinued ones are in the laundry."
3.0,Super cute but very low rise.  Not even close to 4x more like a 1-2x. Keeping them for next year
3.0,My grandson loves it but it was broken the same day he got it. The watch has a latch on the top which keeps the face of the watch (the train faces) down and the watch closed. The latch should have been made with metal instead of plastic. Now the face of the watch flaps open and closed because there is no catch to keep it closed.
3.0,nice looking frame just I don't think the lenses are polarized...
3.0,"roomy, basic bag, no frills. strap can be very long (good for me) and the construction seems decent. Good buy for the price."
3.0,"The USA flag skull cap 4 pack is an excellent quality product. The material and stitching is quite good. Might be a little tight fit for large heads. The 6 pack is a totally different product. Very flimsy material and underwhelming stitching. 6 pack colors are not quite the same as in the listing. Would return the 6 pack,but am too lazy. Get the 4 pack of flag skull caps though."
3.0,"I would have loved these jeans, but....they fit way too small. I would normally wear a large, but I ordered the large and Xlarge just to be sure one of them fit. Well, the Xlarge came first and they were way to small in the waist, which usually runs large for me. The rest of the fit in the Xlarge was great, but not the waist. So, ended up sending both back.<br /><br />The refund for the Xlarge was as expected. When I ordered the Large, I assumed that the refund was free since it was with the Xlarge. No, I was wrong. To send the Large back, it cost me over $5 to send them back. Noting this so others won't get caught thinking that even though it says Free Returns, when you click on the other size, it might not say that. Somewhat disappointing!"
3.0,They didn‚Äôt fit my watch. Giving the measurement and good picture of the piece  that attaches to the watch would be helpful.<br /><br />I also thought I was getting more than one color.
3.0,"Really wanted to love this dress because the style is so cute, but the pink was pretty sheer. Definitely didn't leave much to the imagination unless you're wearing perfectly nude underwear. Otherwise, it was really lightweight, soft, and pretty stretchy. I think it would be great in a darker color"
3.0,"the hat is Ok.  not spectacular & also not bad... but it is pricey for what it is and what the quality feels like.  But I guess it's all good because you can soak it, who knows.  I see other very similar ones for a lot less money and that is what I would do if I did it again.  cheers mate"
3.0,Super cute shirt but it's wayyyyy too big
3.0,"Ordered these in a small, and couldn't get them over my hips. The legs seemed to fit fine but the waist would have ripped if I kept trying to pull them up! I normally wear a small in other leggings, I'm not skinny but 125 with some hips. I definitely needed to go up a size."
3.0,Was not like the picture.  But cute nonetheless.
3.0,I received this dress today. I tried it on and as my arm was going through one sleeve I got someone else‚Äôs hair! Gross!!!! My hair is black and not dyed. Someone must had ombr√© hair bc I was getting a lot of their hair. So gross!
3.0,"Looks good, but turned my skin green."
3.0,I really like this watch band. The only issue I have is that the part that holds the strap after the buckle will move and the watch strap will come loose... My watch has fallen off my wrist a few times because of this. Luckily I always notice and it hasn't broken in the fall. Looking for a watch with 2 straps after the buckle in hopes that will solve this problem.
3.0,Thin material and runs very small. But bought to wear as part of a costume for Halloween so it'll work enough. Would have to return if was planning on wearing for everyday clothing.
3.0,"It‚Äôs plain and nice for a beach cover up. Super stiff, after a wash and dry it‚Äôs fine. The color is not an off white cream it is bright white! Super long as well, I‚Äôm 5foot and the legs align with the floor. Must be hemmed."
3.0,"It's an OK watch, the price is great, and I like the idea, but it's very uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,"I used the size chart, but they were a bit snug. Good thing they can with expanders. I've been using two. Otherwise very nice and comfy."
3.0,The dress is very cute. Order at least one size bigger as they run small. I wish it was more flattering on me. I decided to return it and the seller what awesome in responding very quickly. I would order from them again.
3.0,"While the gloves are nice, I feel they could have been built a bit better around the finger tip edges. Most issues I have with gloves like these are that the tip/edges tend to fall apart/unravel and end up coming apart faster and faster as time goes on. Gluing that up with the black &#34;grip goo&#34; on the palms could have helped with that I feel.<br /><br />Overall though I do enjoy the look and its serving its purpose."
3.0,"It seemed that the sizes were 1 off. Medium fits like a small, large fits like a medium, Xl fits like a large."
3.0,This product works for my needs. I wanted a sports bra that wasn't a racer back and dint suffocate me. I had to take the padding out bc they were wrinkled and the wrinkles appeared through my tank tops. The product arrived like that so it wasn't from washing it.  It looked terrible. They work just as well for me without the padding though. My biggest concern are the straps. They are very think and cheap. I feel that they aren't going to hold up very long. It has been 2 weeks and so far so good though.
3.0,Good quality but small dosn't fit that much
3.0,Belt is smallüòï
3.0,"This is an adorable dress and it fits perfectly. However, it was horribly wrinkled. I had to steam it for 20 minutes to get all the wrinkles out before I could wear it. Also, there were stray threads which makes me concerned about the quality of the product. I hope it stands up to at least a few wears."
3.0,"Nice band, if you wear it every day the writing wears off."
3.0,"The product itself is very pretty, links can be removed and added to make it smaller and bigger. Clasping it closed is the biggest challenge."
3.0,"The fit is a little weird around the shoulders and under the arms, it likes to rise up a lot more than I would have liked. Definitely not a shirt you can tuck in.<br /><br />Size: I am 5'3 and 132 pounds. Ordered a medium."
3.0,My fianc√© love the look and comfort of the glasses.  But one of the lens have already fallen out.
3.0,Theses fit perfect however the quality was terrible. The sewing is terrible and came undone on the very first wear when working out. Would not recommend. Guess you get your money worth truly.
3.0,"It's winter here in NYC and my apartment sits around 50-60F degrees with a small standing heater. I was looking for leg warmers while I play with myself in bed but these don't do any justice. They're pretty low quality being that it's made with only a few layers and when worn and stretched over the legs, will expose tiny holes between the stitched fibers. You will be able to see your skin through the sock's very tiny gaps which is probably why it doesn't retain heat well."
3.0,"To large for me, and somewhat see through"
3.0,"Cute flip flops, but on the thin side. I don‚Äôt have wide feet, yet with these my foot hung over the side. I returned the item. The stones are held in place with a thread running through each, not glued/secured to shoe itself."
3.0,It was shorter on me than on the model. I am 5‚Äô8.
3.0,"The padding is SO hot that it's uncomfortable. These are well made but the padding material used in the crotch and seat is not at all breathable. The padding in the rump is two pieces, and I would prefer one because it gives a bit of an odd shape! The shorts are truly OK, especially for the price, but I'll be looking for ones that are truly breathable."
3.0,Nice jumper fits well but the zipper gets stuck very easily.
3.0,Got 2 sizes one to big other to small
3.0,"I wanted to wear this with leggings, but it is too long for my petite frame.  5ft 1.  Also, at 160 pounds the bust was too tight.  It looks sloppy on me. The color is not a true red, it's almost a pinkish red.  I don't plan on returning this item, but it won't be my favorite thing in the closet."
3.0,"This SHIRT feels soft against my skin and pairs nicely with black leggings or jeans. However, it is absolutely way too short to wear as a dress and is way too large to wear as a normal shirt. I am 5'3 and ~130 lbs so if it is meant to be worn as a dress as shown in the picture, then it should have fit me perfectly. Unfortunately, when I tried this on without pants on my butt was practically showing! As as result I only wear this with leggings even during the warmer months."
3.0,"As soon as I held it up, I could see this would hardly fit over my normal sized adult male head without considerable stretching.  Better suited for a youngster or perhaps a more petite adult - whether male or female.  Except for the size, product seemed as described."
3.0,Way smaller than I thought but pretty and came on time
3.0,Got a medium and I can't imagine that even their small would work out for me. It's too bad because the style and material were great and would have been perfect for backpacking.
3.0,"I purchased the black and white in small, the black fit just fine, but the white was very small, disappointing."
3.0,Good shirt - I no longer buy cotton T's.
3.0,This purse is ok  A little too deep in the inside and I wish it had a key ring
3.0,Didn‚Äôt like the way it fit
3.0,I was really excited about these and was looking forward to wearing them.  I have small ears and they will not stay up on my ears and they pinch.  thinking of sending them back.
3.0,Such a cute outfit but my son didn‚Äôt fit in it for very long so I would suggest ordering a size u.
3.0,Not super flattering. It‚Äôs a bit loose on my chest but I love the length! I‚Äôm curvy so maybe it would fit someone who isn‚Äôt.
3.0,Large is on the smaller side but worked
3.0,Earrings are larger than expected and one of the earrings has a large hump of glue or sealant where the actual flower is attached to the post making the flower tip and not sit straight/centered.
3.0,"This is a mixed review.  I like the leaf and tassel.  It clips onto my earlobe nicely and stays there, looks good.  The part that is supposed to go in the upper ear is defective or the design is bad, will not stay clipped, but keeps popping open.  It looks nice but is useless if I can't wear it."
3.0,Fits great! Way too short for that size!<br />Just because you can doesn't mean you should
3.0,The holes to recieve the stud is too large and they fall out of my ears.
3.0,Got here Wicked Fast. Good hat but would have preferred a bit less white stiching.
3.0,It entangles often.
3.0,"I ordered an M because I thought it was flowy but its true to size. So I am returning it because I wanted a more flowy look then fitted. It's pretty and comfy - it has pockets.<br /><br />The navy blue is not dark navy blue, is navy blue mixed with royal blue."
3.0,que  es  esto.
3.0,Its a cheap dress and looks cheap as well you get what you pay for. I ordered it for a 1920's themed party. Its not bad considering the price but if you spend just a tad bit more you can get a much nicer dress. Although with the right accessories this one does the job.
3.0,My daughter is happy with it and that makes it okay. But I wish the actual pictures were clearer on the earrings. They are kind of hard to see.
3.0,"Upon opening the package, the smell that came out was horrible. I laid them outside for a few days to air out thinking it was just the packaging. It wasn't. I went ahead and washed them and after taking them out of the dryer, they were literally half the size they started out as. If you wash them, make sure to wash them in cold water and let them air dry."
3.0,It‚Äôs nice looking just too skinny.
3.0,The shirt was adorable but ran very small.
3.0,"Looks cheaper than in the pic but still cute and soft. It runs very small. I'm 5'4&#34; and 110lb... I usually wear xs/s but ordered a medium based on reviews. I did want the looser look like on the model and medium fits well, with waist band still fitting tightly. I could have even gotten a large. The hole below the V neck isn't an issue if it fits you."
3.0,My 15 month old regular sized baby is so comfy in these. No more slipping about on the wood floors in socks. Would recommend them. The sock part is showing wear and we haven't had them for long but I expected that considering the price.
3.0,nice product. But it was too difficult for my 68 yr old fingers to manipulate.
3.0,Very nice quality jewelry. The only problem i have is that the sizing is wrong. Instead of 8mm rings i was sent 6mm.
3.0,"some of them were broken<br />some of them arrived with the light already on, so battery died quickly<br />the rest were GREAT fun and have lasted a month already."
3.0,"This is a cute swimsuit. Daughter would have loved to have kept it. Is not true to size. Order up size or two. Especially small in the top. Out of a bigger size when she went to exchange it, so she sadly had to order another set"
3.0,"Shoes were nice but this particular shoe runs small..so unfortunately, they were sent back."
3.0,I didn't think there was anything particularly &#34;special&#34; about this chain.
3.0,"I love the sweatshirt unless it's really cold and windy...the arms of this hoodie are NOT sherpa lined and actually get colder with wind....not happy with this....so if looking for a fully sherpa lined hoodie, this is not the one to get."
3.0,I decided to buy a size up from my size 10 to accommodate wearing socks. Good thing I did! The shoe fits a little snug around the toes even though it's size 11 and I have slender feet! Get a size up! I love how they fit tho!
3.0,Doesn't look at all as the picture.
3.0,"Me gust√≥ la forma de la bolsa pero tiene mala calidad , la correa la remplace definitivamente desde el dia 1 que la recib√≠ y en tan solo unos meses el material con el que est√° forrada la bolsa ya se ve bastante deteriorado por el uso."
3.0,"Nice quality, but I can't use it. My fault"
3.0,"I'm 5'8 and the sleeves were a little too short  but if you are shorter that won't be a problem. The colors were pretty but the material feels really cheap. Overall, usable but I wouldn't recommend them."
3.0,Too thin for my liking.
3.0,"I am 5‚Äô3. 145 pounds, 43 inch hips. Does not fit on my bum. Will either sew slits in or return. Very cute though!"
3.0,"after i bought these on here, i found em 20 dollars cheaper on another website. not good. got taken on that one. the pearl are just okay. they are shiny and a pretty light blue color. not dull grey at all. but looking at them closely, and the quality seems not that great. maybe they are painted over, i don't know. and the asking price on here is way too high. cheaper elsewhere."
3.0,At first thought this was perfect for my Grandson to use when having Physical Therapy. I ordered a Small he‚Äôs 2 years old weight about 22 lbs. He suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury due to shaken baby syndrome. The problem with shirt very hard to get on plus he has a GTube and when I realized the shirt was compressing too much (even though you could put your hand in it) and leaving a imprint on his little tummy from the GTube not willing to risk skin break down. My little buddy has enough to deal with.
3.0,Overall it was a nice jacket. My fiance had a rough time trying to get the collar to stay down based on the light/thin material. The jacket did fit as expected.
3.0,"Si me gusto, un poco peque√±a pero bien"
3.0,"The material is very nice, though not quite as sheer as the picture. I'm 5'4&#34;, around 120 lbs and it looked HUGE on me - it swallowed me up and went almost to my knees. Definitely not what I would want to wear to the beach. Might have been ok if it had an open front.  Might be nice for someone taller."
3.0,It's pretty. I bought it to wear daily but it turned my wrist green. I'll save it for special occasions but now I have to find a different daily band.
3.0,Love this necklace. Have gotten a lot of compliments. Just wish the linked chain necklace was longer. Unfortunately it‚Äôs to small for me so I can‚Äôt wear it.
3.0,They are pretty good<br />Great for touchscreen<br />Some loose threads when I got them in the mail<br />Definitely not water/snow proof<br />Will see if they hold together or end up with holes.<br />Will post after I wear them for a while.
3.0,"These are nice, but the tiny screws are so hard to screw in."
3.0,"the shirt is nice and fits as expected but in the description it says pockets and customer pics show pockets, mine has no pockets and thats the main reason I ordered it!"
3.0,I guess I have small feet because these come off when I'm walking . I wear size 7 - 7.5 in woman shoes.
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and ordered a size large. The length of this dress on the sides are excessively long. They measured 46‚Äù from UNDER THE ARM. The measurement from the straps partially adjusted was 54‚Äù. The sides were dragging on the floor by about 3‚Äù. Returning dress. Bummer because it‚Äôs really cute!
3.0,"Lenses are larger and shaped different than original oakleys, but for the price they are fairly clear, the colors are not bad,(again not the same as oakley) and they do snap into the frames pretty nicely"
3.0,"Material a bit flimsy, but fit okay."
3.0,"For the price, they're decent. It took about a day of painful breaking in before they didn't hurt my feet any longer. They also have a bit of a lingering gasoline-like odor. I'm keeping them because they're ok for the price."
3.0,"Love the material! Wish it was a little smaller, I guess I need to hit the weights more! Lol"
3.0,The hook on adjustable straps were plastic and broke. The rhinestones fell off in excess.
3.0,Cute swimsuit for my little but didn‚Äôt seem like the length was coordinated with the width. We made it work since we were on vacation but it looked odd
3.0,Not bad for the price....
3.0,Great hat for a costume only it's kinda big...like you need a huge head to keep it from falling over your eyes.
3.0,"Loved the fit of this dress. Too bad I could only wear it one time because when I washed it, the strap broke off. üòî"
3.0,Cute idea but you can‚Äôt really tell the image is a cat and it is too large. Overall fine for the price.
3.0,It's very soft & flowing.
3.0,Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,They are cute but little
3.0,"It's a good mask, good material, and it's creepy. All these type of masks have a yucky smell but this one wasn't too bad. My only gripe was the packaging. The mask came super smashed and even after my daughter put it on it was still misshapen. Luckily I ordered it early enough that I was able to stick a balloon inside of it and blow it up to help reshape it. It's still not as perfect as the seller's pic but did do the trick üëå"
3.0,"The material is nice, the pattern is adorable. However, it is VERY small. I do not recommend buying this unless you are a size 6 max, or smaller. Also, IF it fits, I disagree that it is a dress - the length is more fitting as shirt. If you are a smaller petite person, then I would recommend it."
3.0,One bracelet was broke when they arrived. Sent back.
3.0,"The material was comfortable and it looks as featured online. However, the size (I usually wear a M) is somewhat smaller than what I am used to. The sleeves/ armholes are a bit tight. I should have ordered a size up."
3.0,"It nice, love the leather smell, but doesn't look like its going to last long."
3.0,"It appears from the picture that the Huey is embroidered, it is not. The hat overall is of good quality but I didn't like the velcro sizing in the back."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift for my sister, and she said they are very cute and look of good quality but that they seemed to run a little bigger than the size you ordered."
3.0,It took several months to get here. The material is very strange kind of like kids fire resistant pajamas. They are strangely soft though and the fit is cute. I wouldn‚Äôt order this again but I will end up wearing it around the house.
3.0,The dress was beautiful but too small around the chest area. =(
3.0,"Love it and it looks great.. kinda thin but its cool. FYI: It's a zipper on the side, so if that stomach is full"
3.0,"These pants have a long rise.  My wife is petite - 5'2"" and size 6 - and these were too long from the top through the crotch, causing them to be ill fitting.  Her friend, who is taller, 5'7"" and size 6 tried these on and they fit great.  Both of these women have birthed 4+ children and the pants have enough room."
3.0,The ones I received are way too dark for my liking. I can't make out my speedometer half the time when I'm driving.
3.0,"Nice product but I didn't know it was coming from China, I had to pick it up at the post office."
3.0,I have gotten quite a few compliments on this ring.  It's cute.  But super flimsy.  It bends out of shape really easily and requires a lot of adjusting.  Not great quality.  But fun for the price.
3.0,"It looks a little cheap on the flip side, but nice enough for a Doctor Who Fan gift."
3.0,"not satisfied, returned product to Amazon"
3.0,"This wasn't the best-fitting outfit, but still fun to wear."
3.0,This dress runs really small. I normally wear a size 10 but ordered a 12 and  I could still use a little more room. Nice dress though!
3.0,I bought a 2x but it is really tight and hard to get on. It doesn't stretch very well. Plus the front is to high up.
3.0,The cut out hurts by big toe right above the nail
3.0,Material is different
3.0,"This is made fine, and would work for a luggage strap if your luggage is falling apart.<br /><br />But security-wise, don't bother, for several reasons:<br />1.  The buckle is actually plastic<br />2.  There is always a way to just slide the belt over, so you can get into a suitcase.  It isn't secure at all, even if you tighten it.<br />3.  The TSA keys are publicly available by thieves."
3.0,"Purchased for summer they're too heavy weight. The fit is nice, as expected. The color pretty. They wash well and are soft. The collar lies funny and the corners don't lie flat they curl up."
3.0,Bottoms are tiny
3.0,"Very cute shirt, but it runs real small.  Its sad that I ordered up and it's still too small"
3.0,Didn‚Äôt look like it did on the model.  Really big on me.
3.0,not crazy about the way it looks on ME.
3.0,I like the goggles but I DIDNT GET THE STICKER! I am so so mad. It said I would get a free sticker if I bought the glasses. I could have gotten any other pair or even a cheaper pair but I specially bought this pair because I wanted clout goggles and they came with a free sticker which made it even more worth it.
3.0,"Would have been 4 stars or higher but I'm rating three only because I was expecting the ring to come in a box as shown in the picture.  I wanted that big bang bix, instead it came in a tiny tiny somewhat crushed blue box. The ring itself looks very cheap. Probably not worth $6.99 BUT I love GD and am still content with the ring itself."
3.0,"The necklace seems very nice and durable, but is FAR smaller than the advertised &#34;Product Dimensions: 3.9 x 3 x 0.7 inches.&#34;  In fact the cross I received is 1 inch wide and 1.25 inches long. For my purposes I needed the larger size that was listed.  This would be a good size for a service member seeking to wear it with dog tags."
3.0,At first I wasn't sure about them because I'm allergic to anything fake but the cones are soooo cute! They're now part of my daily jewelry & I love them! Super affordable & actually hypoallergenic!!
3.0,Sent the wrong color ... but love the material
3.0,"It is a little baggy but that's not the problem.. the problem is...IT SHOWS EVERY ROLL IN MY STOMACH, and I'm not that &#34;rolly&#34;. Quality in fabric is ok but I wish I would have gotten a darker color. I plan to send it back because I will be insecure about my body in this. Too bad because I love purple and this was going to be my Super Woman/Lupus Fighter dress. Purple =Lupus"
3.0,Size to big should be like original size kd's
3.0,somewhat small but not bad i like them.
3.0,"From a third party selling. This comes from China. You can get this same shirt on the wish app for cheaper. I got an xl it is short on me and tight around my neck. Cheap  Material. Would of been happy with it, if wasn't small."
3.0,"I absolutely love these sunglasses and might buy another pair, but the soft material on the portion that rest on your eyes wears quickly (one year for me, but maybe that's the life expectancy)."
3.0,"I like the styling of this watch, and the band is awesome, but the top &#34;pusher&#34; fell out and could not be secured, so I returned the product."
3.0,"As another reviewer here has stated, while these PJ‚Äôs appear to LOOK identical to the ones sold in local COSTCO stores this past Spring, they are cut a full size smaller than those purchased in the store.  The XL fit great for the in-store purchases but is clearly too small for the ones I purchased here at Amazon.  So‚Äîwhile they are otherwise very nice‚Äîdo yourself a favor and SIZE UP a size if you want them to fit.  For reference‚ÄîI‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 165 lbs and wear a size 14 Misses dress or jeans.  I had to go up to the XXL to be comfortable in these PJ‚Äôs."
3.0,This dress is cute but not fit to measure actual sizes. Dress arrived completely crushed and wrinkled in shrink wrap and needed to be taken to dry cleaner to get wrinkles out prior to wearing. Overall quality was very cheap and the dress was so big it could not even be safety pinned to fit properly.
3.0,"5'6&#34;, 170lbs, 36C. this was too small and very unflattering.  not good for hiding the post-baby belly at all.  fabric was thin and cheap.  white was a weird bluish white too. returned"
3.0,Lenses are a washout tone which is not noticible on picture. I can see both men and women wearing them.
3.0,"Not the best quality (obviously) and there are 3 &#34;hooks&#34; holding each piece together which I thought were hideous. I ordered an XL due to my chest size. The bottoms were really big, but when I washed them, they shrank considerably."
3.0,Worn for 2 weeks. So far its held up. Probably matches the black watch better than the gold
3.0,These are cute but very tiny! Perfect size for a 3-5 yr old! I got them for my 12 yr old so I am not sure if they are going to be too small yet!
3.0,I ordered this bracelet for my daughter for Christmas and last week it broke. She only wore it 3 weeks and the charm fell apart and can not be put back together.
3.0,i only liked a few of the choices
3.0,It's cute but one of the triangle earrings has a circle on it. It's dipped gold.
3.0,"Good quality and material, but the shipping sucks. I thought they would take the caution to send it on a box . When I received my hat it was all wrinkled like a crumbled newspaper on one side ."
3.0,I ordered a large.  I am a 34C and its tight  in the chest area.
3.0,According to their chart I should be a medium but had to return and get a large which fits me around my chest but now the bottom is down between my knees.  I had to have it tailored (shortened) to fit right.  Quality is average.
3.0,Love the look but it‚Äôs not too durable.
3.0,Good fit ... cloth quality is not good I bought  for my daughter's dance performance..
3.0,came with a knot in the chain. GRRRRRRRRR
3.0,"The &#34;L&#34; shape is too short, so the nose rings keep falling out. Love the colors/variety."
3.0,"Better than the other glasses I've used, but still not good for long time (1hr+) under a light, even with a large sun hat."
3.0,"This suit is very cute and fits well, except for the top. The cups are quite small for the measurements given. I'm a size 22 and it fits fantastic except for the cups and there is boob spillage on the sides and from the too small cups.  And if it didn't come from China I'd probably have sent it back for a return. This having been said I'm glad I bought it for use in our home pool and not for vacation."
3.0,Appears to be a sturdy bracelet. Too bad it's too small.
3.0,One of the things that drew me to this dress was the cute belt that was supposed to come with it. The dress that I received did not come with a belt. Another issue that I had with the dress was that it only had one small snap that held the top of the dress in place. It created a large gap in the dress and would require a slip or cami to prevent flashing the entire world. I am a C cup so I don‚Äôt have huge breasts but thus was a huge problem for me. I wound up returning the dress since it didn‚Äôt work for me.
3.0,Mi amiga dice Es bueno pero la tela es muy  transparente como para entrenar con el
3.0,"It's okay, should of got one with more brushes this brush alone doesnt do the job. If you're looking to just touch up some shoes is it it."
3.0,"After having my baby I was looking for clothing that wasn't tight, to feel comfortable wear. I have bought clothes off here before but this item was a little snug for the size I bought. I love the shirt but wasn't happy with how it fit."
3.0,It‚Äôs a little too fragile than I expected for the price. Bought it for my granddaughter. Hope it is strong enough.
3.0,"Colors are not as bright and vibrant as shown in the picture, but it is a cute cover up."
3.0,"If you have high arches and your toes tend to push into the toe box of shoes, these are unfortunately not for you. Bought in 8.5 and 9, fit about the same. They're very cute and would have liked to keep them but the toe box was too tight."
3.0,I would say make sure you don‚Äôt wear these until you‚Äôre somewhat healed because I believe these will irritate your nose from the type of metal it is. It irritated mine but now I can wear them fine
3.0,It looks great and is very comfortable. It wrinkles too easilyl
3.0,It‚Äôs fits true to size
3.0,The only think is that is the band is turning yellow. Is pretty but the color change is really disappointing.
3.0,"Quality good, about 2 sizes smaller than all my other clothes in XXL"
3.0,"the ones that came with it are as comfortaable as hand cuffs - very stiff.  these are better, but still not great"
3.0,"Good product. Colors and patterns just according pictures. Really light feeling fabric, ideal for summer. Delivered on time. Goods price for three units."
3.0,It‚Äôs a little bit too small
3.0,"Beautiful dress. Very very long. I'm 5'6, 140 pounds. I ordered a large. The length hits the top of my feet. The waist is a lot tighter than I thought it would be, so if you have any belly fat at all you will look pregnant."
3.0,It's not as nice as the picture.  It's hard to open and close it.  It would be good for a child though.
3.0,Picture makes it look better it fit but on the padding was weird and thick the whole shirt slides from the left to the right maken chest look wonky has no support the straps are in a weird position it's kinda cute
3.0,This product was shipped to me and I believe it was a returned item. There were no tags on the dress and weird wrinkles in a dress that should have few if no wrinkles.
3.0,Was a tad large. It seemed to do the job for the costume but wasn‚Äôt worth the money for the quality.
3.0,Super cute. I wish it ran larger.
3.0,"This is a nice keychain, but the capitalization scheme for the words is random (and different than in the picture). It looks like it was made by someone who doesn't understand how to speak/write/capitalize English (which, according to the ""Made in China"" label, is true)."
3.0,Medium fits more like a large.
3.0,"The tights were waaaay small. They fit my 2 year old great niece rather than my 7 yr old great niece. Even allowing if they were supposed to be maybe cropped. They were super tight and came to her knees. BUT they were made of a really soft material, and my 2 year old great-niece loves them. So win? The top, fit perfectly though and is made from a very soft material and is now one of my great-niece's favorite shirts. So, I guess it wasn't too bad for the price."
3.0,"I am 5 ft 2 in and have full DD breasts.  This was not what I was expecting, I would not consider this as a good fit for me.  I would compare it to a retail store xl if your looking for anything larger than that I don‚Äôt suggest this top for you.  Good quality just not for larger breasted women unless you only want your nipples covered."
3.0,Prettt but the shirt was too small!!! Pants fit just right!!
3.0,I bought these socks due to the reviews. 2 pairs fit fine the solid pink do not fit. They are very small and slip into my shoes which made a blister on my heel. So all I have to say is buyer be ware.
3.0,I‚Äôve learned to order a size larger on Amazon and this was no exception. I knew from reviews that it didn‚Äôt have cuffs but thought the sleeves would be full length. They‚Äôre only 3/4 sleeves so I took stars off for that reason. Thin material but cute
3.0,This top was small as the dickens! It said 3x so I got excited but let me tell y‚Äôall! I had to cut the neck to get my head inside. It does NOT stretch neither!  I need it for a quick skit. Hopefully I don‚Äôt pass out with this unbreathable material. It is perfect for a tall slim guy but a woman with curves. Don‚Äôt do it girl! üòùüòùüòùüòù
3.0,Not the color I expected and tight compared to my usual size. Order up a size.
3.0,Too thick for the pendant
3.0,"This shirt is soft and long but it doesn't cling to the body, so it doesn't work as an under-layer."
3.0,Thin fabric very see thru
3.0,"I bought these to wear under my scrubs and they are so comfortable! They fit snug and stay in place. Light smooth athletic-feeling material as well. I wash with cool/warm water and throw in the dryer after with my other items and no issues.<br />Update sept 2022--- after only wearing the white tank one day a week for about 6 weeks, the thread on the strap came apart and the shirt fell apart from that seam. I'm pretty disappointed. The black and grey seem to be doing alright at this time."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:fda5fb5d8d29186bd2d17f12927bfc65]] I bought three of these for all the car keys. They look great, but they are too ‚Äòtall‚Äô for modern keyless fob car keys. I got one wrangled onto my Volvo key and we had to use pliers and destroy the ring to get it off, and it scraped the shiiz out of the top of my key. Didn‚Äôt work on hubbies Chevy truck keys either. I got one onto our son‚Äôs VW key, but it‚Äôs just able to move, and will be a sideways key ring in a pocket. We will probably end up taking that one off as well. It‚Äôs the same problem for a small square Tile. They look cool, but are thicker than it would appear."
3.0,Black dress is pretty but fabric is very stiff and wrinkles easily.  Fair price for quality though.
3.0,not really one size fits all. very small. but cute hat
3.0,ok...not great.  was a gift.
3.0,"The concept of these is great but they are a little awkward to use. It's nice to have the breathing space and they do work well for that but they don't stick to anything so when you take the mask off they fall, also if your mask is too tight they will leave a mark on your face."
3.0,"Wig looks great in the package, and ok the 1st time you put it on....then it kinda looks like one of the apes from planet of the apes....very awkward to put on.  Fit is good, fits a large head, maybe my hair styling skills are the problem.  Sorry I paid $25 and shipping and cant use it for the play I am in...."
3.0,Was great when it first arrived.  It now after a few washings it's all out of shape and fits like a rug. It's a shame cause it was wonderful at first.
3.0,Way too big and way too wide
3.0,"I purchased this bag in black in 2017.  Love it so much I'm buying a 2nd for a spare.  It is really soft, love the pockets that zipper.  It is the perfect bag for me.  Would purchase again.  May buy a 3rd back up bag as the price for leather purse really good and I hate when I find something I love then can't find it again!! I didn't have the problem with the dye that some people did.<br /><br />**Update** Got the new purse and returned it. The design and size have changed since I ordered the original one. Leather was much rougher and bag smaller. Disappointed so I'll be taking extra care of my old one."
3.0,I feel that the material was good quality but the color of the outfit was so faded looked like he had wore it 4 past Halloween‚Äôs but he liked it so we went with it !
3.0,Nice item not what I wanted to wear
3.0,Absolutely loved the style of this skirt. Especially the pockets! However the material wasn't the best quality and tended to stick to itself making it not terribly comfortable to wear. It also had a rather strange smell to it. Unfortunately I decided to return it.  Wish that they would revisit this style with better material though!
3.0,Nice dress but the bust was too large for me.
3.0,Size runs too smallüòï
3.0,"They were bigger and longer then expected. I dont think true to the photo, but comfortable cotton"
3.0,"I have used the suitcase twice and the inner zipper has already broken in the larger case. I also can not figure out how to change the code ... so don‚Äôt forget it!!  I do like the color, for it is very visible in the baggage claim!!!!"
3.0,Fit is smaller than I'd like but based on other reviews I wasn't surprised.  What I don't like is that the sleeves are also too short.  So short that I don't think ordering a larger size would make enough of a difference to make the thumb holes useable.
3.0,Arrived smaller than I expected. Was a bit disappointed about the size.
3.0,"Straps are melted to it and they brake easily, mask itself are great really confortable"
3.0,It's not sterling silver like most of the quality charms.. which is OK BUT it had a burr around the inside of the hole. Had to take it to a jeweler to have it filed off. Expected better quality. The Doctor would not have approved.
3.0,Color and style were just beautiful but the material wouldn't breath.  I think they would have beeen very uncomfortable to sleep in.
3.0,They look fine but run small. Good for layering
3.0,"The vent in the side has a round plastic disk, doesn't protect you from germs"
3.0,"I bought this for the socks/booties. I needed something for our Xmas pics that was silver. I hate when products do sizing 0-12 months, that doesnt make sense, babies grow so quickly there is no way this would fit a baby for a year. The headband and socks seems to be fairly good quality, the hair clip doesn't close well. The packaging arrived completely smashed too, which for me doesn't matter, but if it was for a gift it wouldn't have been nice to present!"
3.0,"These are advertised as being wide in the toe box for a more natural toe splay. However I found them about average width to narrow. Keen, Merrill, and Blundstone are all wider in the toe box than these."
3.0,While the purse is cute it is a waste of money. I bought two of these in different patterns.  While using each of them for the first time the zipper for the change compartment broke.
3.0,I truly loved the bracelet- but literally wearing it for 5-6 weeks ... careful not to get it wet and just breaks and falls off.<br /><br />If you buy it you should glue the ends before wearing it
3.0,"A little short, but thick material. Overall cute dress."
3.0,Not the quality I was expecting.  Looked already worn out when I got it.
3.0,"The color on these earrings are a pretty Swiss Blue which is why I wanted them. They are heart-shaped but they small enough it's hard to tell.<br /><br />And that's an issue because there's no way these earrings have a combined carat weight of 3 carats. The stones are about 6 mm and for CZ that puts them in at a carat or maybe a little less per earring. I don't necessarily consider them too small to wear but if you're expecting 3 total cts, then you'll be disappointed. The backs are also tiny.<br /><br />These earrings have a low pricing point and I'm glad I wasn't expecting more. They aren't worth sending back so I'll keep them and wear them....while I look for something better."
3.0,"Needs a hem on the top and bottom edges to keep it from rolling up.  Also, the picture on Amazon did not match the item received.  The picture depicted an Orc with Caucasian flesh tones, but the item was of a dark greyish Orc.  Not a big deal, but I selected the item because the picture closely matched my skin tones and I wanted the item to give the impression at first glance that I had tusks and was not wearing a mask.  Anyway, it's OK but I was a little disappointed.  Oddly enough, I ordered another product from the same sight for my wife and the material was more thicker and substantive, and it was hemmed on both ends and came with a drawstring and barrel lock on the top edge.  Go figure."
3.0,I'm a size 4 and this fits like a size 8.
3.0,"I was disappointed with this product.  It smells nice, but it did not do a good job cutting the awful odor of my husband's boots.  After trying this, he remembered that years ago he used to use Shower-to-Shower powder in his stinky sneakers, and that worked great.  So we tried that---and it eliminates the odor completely!!  So I recommend that you don't bother spending your money on this Kiwi product."
3.0,"Pros: These pants are comfortable, long (good for taller people), and have a pocket for your phone<br />Cons: These pants sag down easily if doing a lot of movement or if you have the phone in the pocket.  (I tried to play tennis in them and had to keep pulling them up)"
3.0,"Cute, but way to small. I ordered this in small for my 12 year old (5'2&quot;, 95 lbs). The top fit as expected, but the bottoms were way to small."
3.0,Beautiful appearance but has a very strong odor to it. I haven‚Äôt been able to use it yet because of the smell triggering headaches.
3.0,bracelet much too heavy. arrived on time and packaged well.  Bracelet weight compared to information disc is much too heavy.
3.0,These flattened my bums
3.0,The socks are thin for a boot sock. The fit is good.
3.0,"This shirt was more beautiful in person and I was sorry it was cut so small, particularly around the arms and chest."
3.0,"Pretty good. The nose piece digs into my nose and cuts off air, and my nose is average size. You‚Äôll be fine if you‚Äôve got a small, small nose."
3.0,"Although the quality is good, the size is too small for use as a necklace.  It would be more suited as a charm for a bracelet than a necklace."
3.0,The balls are WAY too hard to take on and off
3.0,I expected a bigger hat based on the pic. Brim wasn't as wide as I expected.
3.0,"Very snug on the neck (almost chokish) fabric is elastic material like a fitness shirt. It's nice but not the same washed out design as pictured, it's a very flat grey color."
3.0,"These pants are thin, and they don't really stay in place. I've worn then for volleyball and soccer and I'm not super encouraged for wearing them for running. Wind cuts right through the material. They're cute, just not made for the cold."
3.0,This is an overall nice hat but as you see in the description the brim is somewhat flat and this is what I expected but to my dismay it was curved when I got it.Not a big deal just sprayed some starch on the brim and ironed it flat.Oh and one more thing the buckle is not very strong my head is small so I adjusted it but the buckle keeps on unbuckling maybe its my fault I dont know but overall a good buy!
3.0,The material is pretty thin and the shorts were too big. Size down...I returned it.
3.0,"The arms are a bit tight, and the one i got was quite brighter, but the chest was a good fit"
3.0,The design of this top is really cute but unfortunately it's very impractical once you're wearing it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I put this on is that in order to get it to stay on my shoulders when I'm not moving I have to pull it significantly down‚Ä¶ That ended up creating a crease where the solid part of the shirt was getting caught on my strapless bra and bulged out a little bit awkwardly on the top of the shirt.<br /><br />But what came worse was that any movement of your arms sense the elastic portion up over your shoulders‚Ä¶ I understand that when you're wearing a top that off your shoulders you can't throw your arms in the air because nothings going to hold it on‚Ä¶ But I could barely lift up my arm to take the mirror pictures with the shirt on without it popping back up on my shoulders‚Ä¶ I have two young children and there is no way that I would ever be able to make it five minutes in my house with the shirt off my shoulders like it's supposed to be worn.<br /><br />I'm sure that I'm still going to wear it from time to time when I'm out with my husband or maybe at a barbecue‚Ä¶ But definitely not when I know I'm going to have to be moving‚Ä¶ This is made to pretty much be standing or sitting while you're sipping a drink‚Ä¶ But not dancing or picking up your kids.
3.0,Fabric feels cheap. A bit loose. The worst part is it is insanely staticky and clingy. Definitely wear a slip.
3.0,"Cute, but definitely order a size up if you're at all busty, otherwise the bodice gaps significantly."
3.0,The design is cute but the chain is horrible. I believe it would look better in a gold chain instead of silver. Their chain is dinky dink. I swapped the chain out but I love the design and colors. It feel like light weight styrofoam jewelry

3.0,"Cute , soft material runs big"
3.0,"This is a great watch. It's stylish, glows in the dark, waterproof, and automatic. Unfortunately, a tiny screw that keeps the locking clip in place fell out and was lost somehow. The watch still stays together when its closed, but when I take it off the loose rod falls out almost every time. I would send it back to get it fixed, but it costs $28 which is not worth such a tiny piece of the watch."
3.0,"Much smaller than I expected, but hey, it's a Casio and it works, so I am ok with it."
3.0,read the review and went a size up but its a litte bit large so a M was perfect instead of a L
3.0,This is cute but I‚Äôm considering taking in the part when a small piece of plastic is permanently holding the fabric between the two cups together. Perhaps it would fit much better if it was just sewn instead
3.0,only complain is they are very see though .... very.<br /><br />wish I could had seen and made sure they were a bit thicker --- that's the only reason they got a 3 star
3.0,Pretty short in the length and a bit smaller than I would like.
3.0,"Fits a little funny on my head, and thus not the most comfortable, though I haven't really used it much yet. Cover's much of the head, including the ears, and is very warm."
3.0,"SUPER cute, but I ordered 9-12 months and it looks like it would fit a 5-year-old.  Had to return it.  I'm attaching a photo of 2 different rash guards that I bought at the same time, both 9-12 months.  The blue one way WAY too big and the red one wouldn't even fit on one leg of my 5-month-old grandson!"
3.0,"So, I actually ended up returning this product. The dress was cute on the hanger, the fabric was comfortable, and it fit well...but I ordered the white version, and it was fairly see-through, even with neutral undergarments. I wouldn't have been comfortable wearing it without a slip, which sort of defeated the purpose of a light summer dress. I might order one of the darker colors though...it really is a cute dress, and it was flattering."
3.0,So much smaller than expected but still pretty cool
3.0,this was a child size..........
3.0,"Positives: I like the chunky knit on this sweater, the length and the color.<br /><br />Cons: The knit gets snagged on EVERYTHING (I can't wear a necklace or watch when I wear this sweater as it pulls out the loops!); it ends up being a little see-through, so you have plan your layers; and the knit gets saggy after one (1) wear.<br /><br />I discovered al these issues after I wore it, so didn't return it. It'll probably only last me this one season..."
3.0,Pants were short
3.0,"Pay close attention to the sizing- I'm a solid size 6-8, and the LARGE was the right size.  The top was a little wide on the sides even after I adjusted the straps.  It was a little more fitted on the bottom, and looked nice instead of baggy like some jumpsuits.  Also, the color is a little more peachy than brown.  For me, the deal breaker was the material.  It's cheap polyester- the kind that sounds like a windbreaker/ swishing when you walk & have thighs that rub together like me.  Couldn't handle the swishing sound when I walked!  Go for it if you have a thigh gap!"
3.0,Wayyyy too small üò¨
3.0,"OK dress, I ordered a bunch of dresses for a wedding but only needed one so ended up returning this one.  The material is super stretchy and doesn't feel very sturdy."
3.0,Color looks a bit different than the photo!
3.0,The shoes are made very well and are super cute but for a 0-6 month it's huge.  More like a 6-12 month show.
3.0,It is very hard to tell the difference between the colors. They are all shades of blue. The red one is not red (it is blue) and the green and purple are only slightly different from the blue. It is impossible to tell the difference on first glance - you need to really look to tell them apart. The kids are happy but I would be happier if the colors were more distinctive.
3.0,"not bad for the price, but not as good as the picture looks"
3.0,"The bow is not connected to the headband, it is a separate piece of fabric. So, the headband cannot be adjusted in size--which is the biggest flaw with this item. Otherwise, prints and soft fabric are great."
3.0,very thin and cheap
3.0,Really cute but they sit on my ear weirdly. I won‚Äôt be able to wear these at all!
3.0,Gorgeous shoes!!! But they run super small.. like 2 sizes lower than the stated number. Good luck
3.0,"Very cute- worked for Ms. Frizzle Halloween costume. Fairly big, looks like a toy dinosaur made into earrings, but light enough to wear all day.<br /><br />Big complaint is that the stack of hearts on each earring are different colors. The description said that they would not be like the photo, but I had thought they would at least be like each other."
3.0,forget swimming showering or even being in the presence of water with these on. the white turned yellow after 2 days and the silver is bright red now
3.0,The fit & feel great but after a while the seam stitching starts coming apart
3.0,"They are OK, but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Product seemed cheesy for almost $30.00. PLUS when I received it, the plastic battery tab was already pulled out and the batteries were dead. for the amount of money I paid, I should have had working batteries. Now I have to go out and pay more money for batteries. Quite disappointed!"
3.0,Got these in August for my daughter. She wore them often but not every day. The souls are already coming off. Hasn‚Äôt been 6 months. She‚Äôs 15 but not hard on them. They were cute while they lasted. A little dissertation they‚Äôre falling apart already. Fit as expected though need to wear them in.
3.0,Bought the biggest size top fit perfect but bottoms did not
3.0,"These are lovely but they are much too long in the waist! I am nearly 6 ft tall and they still came up halfway to my bra! I think they would work better for someone who has a rounder tummy. They were very pretty, high quality fabric and seam work was good. They just did not fit me very well at all"
3.0,Fit was extremely large. Material was as expected for the price. Ordered a small that fit much more like a large/XL
3.0,Size is a bit smaller than expected
3.0,"I have a chunky knit sweater jacket from this brand that I LOVE however I don't love this so much. This looks so much better in the photo. The sweater is just okay looking, it's thin and looks really old.  The armpits are just weird and saggy."
3.0,Ripped at the seam on day 2. It can be fixed but kinda thought it should hold up a little better. Definitely a novelty mask and not a mask to be worn everyday.
3.0,"Very pretty and a great size.  However, One on the stones had fallen off an earring and was lying in the bottom of the box. I can't decide if I'm going to keep this set or send it back."
3.0,"I like the style of the watch. The material is a little cheap looking around the dial, but I do get a lot of compliments on the watch. Most recently, I have been having issues with the watch not keeping time properly. I have had it for about 7 months now, so a little concerning that it is running into issues like this already."
3.0,"This dress hangs very oddly, there‚Äôs no drape to the fabric. Mine was tight in the chest and then went straight out, I felt like I looked like a triangle from the side. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 around 145 and I got a large.  Embroidery is very pretty though and I think it‚Äôd work nicely for those with a smaller chest. Maybe it softens up after washing but I didn‚Äôt like it long enough to find out, it‚Äôs going back."
3.0,they run a tad small after washing and it would have been helpful to say it you are close get the next size up.  I don't feel they are true to sz after washing.  And that would have helped me order a better size....  kids don't want to send back and get a new pair they want them now if you get what I mean.  I asked for a response to my question and have not been emailed back and that to me is disappointing.  They aren't made the same as they used to be quality wise but they are still on the better side.
3.0,"Typically order XXL in button shirts.<br />6ft, 240 lbs<br /><br />Shirt is too large and sleeve is more like 5/6 than a 3/4<br />Maybe if I would have got a XL it would have fit better."
3.0,The buckle has weird second loop of metal that catches on everything! Color and fit is great!
3.0,The band is pretty ok. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired and mine didn't come with the case so that's super disappointing considering that's 70% of the reason I chose this option.
3.0,Still cute
3.0,I love the feel and design.  It was too large so I can't wear it.
3.0,Cute but turned my neck green on day 3
3.0,"Dress looked nice, fit well. But was described as cotton with lace and dress material was more like a plastic white table cloth than cotton, very disappointing"
3.0,Super soft and comfortable but a lot wider than I would‚Äôve expected and a lot shorter than I would‚Äôve expected
3.0,Was way too small for me however fit my 11 yr old son perfect and he loved it.
3.0,This dress was so beautiful just poorly made strings were coming out everywhere and the bow was hanging on by a thread. I started a return but I didn't have to return it and still got refunded.
3.0,"I have not gifted yet, so it has not been worn or tested for chain quality, etc. I am writing to say that the stone received was not clear at all. I ordered a clear crystal. I have plenty of stones, so know that there can be variation and cloudiness in clear crystal stones. This looks more like a moonstone or something similar. It is milky white. It does not appear to be a crystal to me. This is somewhat disappointing, but the price was not expensive and I was actually not expecting much. The presentation is nice."
3.0,"These are HUGE.... but they are also really warm. Perfect for at-home socks. Probably too thick for boots,"
3.0,Its shorter and smaller than appears.
3.0,"I got these because chemo has damaged my nerves in my legs and feet. And for some reason I thought hey maybe these would help me feel better. Plus, I figured my husband is a big time runner so if I didn‚Äôt like them he could use them.  Well I‚Äôm glad I had a backup reason for them because I don‚Äôt want them on me anymore. I forgot they put socks like this on me when I had surgery and stayed in hospital last time. Ahhhh. I put them on and at first felt tingles like when you put on ben gay or something. Which that part I didn‚Äôt mind. I thought that meant they were working. Then I laid down and fell asleep on mistake for maybe five minutes only. Oh no. I woke back up my feet and legs throbbing I couldn‚Äôt get them off fast enough I hated the way they made me feel lol.  To tight. They were about to get cut off. But for my husband they work.  I wish I didn‚Äôt get some so long that kind of bothers him. he not really into long socks. But maybe when it gets cold again he will appreciate that. So this I don‚Äôt know not good buy for me but ok buy for him I guess.<br />I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is one hundred percent my own opinion. No monetary compensation was received and I was not required to write a positive review. If you have found this review to be helpful, please mark it as such in the feedback section. thank you :)"
3.0,"It is accurate description, however I wore them for 15 minutes and all but 5 of the stones f3ll out. The stones that didn't were glued in sideways. Just not an appealing peoce of jewelry"
3.0,"The watch clock itself works on and off, whereas the clock just stays stuck on one time for sometime...."
3.0,Cute shoes but my 8 month old only wore them a couple of times before they became worn in looking. Seams unraveling and they look faded.
3.0,Not for average tall women. I am 5‚Äô8 and this was short even with flats.
3.0,Ok. Nothing exceptional.  Would not recommend.
3.0,"They are polarized but the lens weren't multicolored like in the picture. Also lenses are very flimsy and not well made but for the price, it not that bad. Just know that you're not getting Oakleys. They serve as work glasses and nothing more. Of course u would know that otherwise I wouldn't be be buying an $8 pair of glasses!"
3.0,The dress is beautiful but the fit was not good.  It felt sloppy around the shoulders and I have large shoulders.
3.0,The length was wayyy tooo long. Also the arms were also crazy long.
3.0,"It was shipped fast by the seller, but I don't think the photo accurately depicts what I received - the photo looks to me like a 'luster' finish - neither gloss nor flat/matte - somewhere in-between.  What I received is completely flat/matte and looks quite dull.  I don't believe I received the wrong item - I simply think the photo is a bit misleading.<br /><br />Oh well..."
3.0,It's definitely not 6MM in size but 4 or 5 MM. This was supposed to be given as a gift but was a disappointment and had to keep it.
3.0,"Beautiful pendant. Weak chain,too fragile."
3.0,"The belt is nice and flexible, it lasted about about one year then broke."
3.0,This is so pretty but it was to big
3.0,"I was going to wear this for a Y2K era party but couldn‚Äôt because of the bra top. If you are too heavy and need support in the boobs area, do not get it. The shorts and jacket was fine but it just did not complete the look without the bra top."
3.0,Love this set but unfortunately it shrunk in washing. Still like it just has more of a Capri look than I anticipated did a winter pajama.
3.0,"I like the lace part of the top, the bottom is not the greatest. It fit okay."
3.0,just to be sure so buyer can BEWARE - this watch (though really nice overall) is NOT WATERPROOF.  DO NOT SUBMERGE in water.  It can get LIGHTLY splashed on but CANNOT be submerged (not even in the shower).  Just be aware.  Water RESISTANT is NOT waterPROOF.  It can and will be ruined and stop working if you fully submerge it in water.
3.0,"The stone  is beautiful and far exceeded my expectations.  The chain is also pretty,  butbit is very poorly made.  We have three of these neclaces and teo of the chains have already broken within less than two months of occasional use.  I'd  say,  put it on another chain!"
3.0,The shirt fits except for the top button around the next.  Had to move the button so it wouldn't choke my son all night.
3.0,Too short for my 5'6&#34; frame.
3.0,"Good product, but no where near the size expected. Listed as large (China), it would be a small in a US size."
3.0,"Product is good and does what its supposed to but the 3 stars honestly is for the lack of transparency from the shipper notifying they are chinese imports and will take a while to arrive  amazon was saying it was lost in transit and for a month the only info i had was ""a shipping label was printed"""
3.0,It‚Äôs pretty. Not very flattering for those with larger hips. It‚Äôs made pretty well. It‚Äôs ok... to
3.0,"Since the band turned out to be too big for my watch, any watch, I didn't get a chance to use it.  Didn't think about the band being too wide for the watches I have.  Live and learn."
3.0,It's a great size but the words are very hard to make out.  Especially 'Friends'.  A little disappointed about that.
3.0,The material is too itchy for my sensitive skin. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 135 I ordered a medium and I could have gone with the small. Also I should have read the comments to find out the blue ‚Äújacket‚Äù is just a design and not actual jacket so that‚Äôs a little strange too.
3.0,"This looked so pretty in the pictures and the fit was my size, but in truth when I got it, it was just not cute and fit way too small. I won't be buying another of these."
3.0,sizes are bigger than they claim
3.0,"Just as pictured but the length could have been a little longer, a bit short"
3.0,"Purse is ok, but not big enough and there needs a little larger handles."
3.0,I love them but I hasn't happy to notice 1 Gemini charm missing and also the sagittarius is in the wrong language.
3.0,"These leggings are helpful at sucking in the belly. Lol. They are beautifully colored with light and dark shades of navy and blue with the white I also really love the see thru dark navy on the bottom sides of like where your ankles are on the leggings nice that there also is a deep pocket in the left  side of the leggings, it's deep enough to fit most cell phone etc. Nice and comfy pair of leggings."
3.0,"Bought this as a gift for my partner and he had a hard time twisting it. Its a design flaw, really. It needs like a crossbar in the middle so your fingers have something to grab on to. Not really worth the money. It's better to just get a 4 way stretcher that has the crossbar."
3.0,"They are beautiful,  but they break within a month and beads go everywhere. I've bought 2 or 3 in the past.  If you could somehow make them stronger, they would definitely be 5 stars."
3.0,"Its a bit snuggle, not that warm for a down coat"
3.0,These are very pretty and detailed. The feminine mask has large enough eye holes so your eyelashes do not touch and it doesn't bother your eyes. I would have kept them to use for our party but I tried the feminine mask on it was able to be tied but it would not stay in place. It would have to pinned to your hair somehow and that just didn't work for me. They are very pretty but I had to return them to find something that would stay on and in place.
3.0,It's the Decepticon emblem. Pretty solid. Kinda small but looks good.  The chain is a little small for my liking. Could be a little longer.
3.0,"It's a great weight for summer and the size is also good.  However, there is a &#34;Pashmina&#34; label that is stuck on it with laundry info.  When I removed that label/sticker it left a noticeable mark on the wrap itself.  Very poor."
3.0,Nice shirt but not as flowing an long as pictured an runs a bit small
3.0,"Love the color, style, fabric. Unfortunately the size small was just too big. Maybe if I wore a belt with it? Either way I'll need to return it. I'm 5'7"", 128lbs8lbs, 34b."
3.0,Bracelet is pretty. A blue color comes of the bracelet.
3.0,"Great little sleep dress, but beware of the glitter on the skirt. It falls off easily and leaves a trail of sparkle."
3.0,"The design is stunning, but the hat does not fit as well as the 2020 version. The crown feels tall/square, the bill is shorter, and it feels overall smaller."
3.0,"Tye quality of the fabric isnt bad nor is the print, but you van tell it was just cut straight across, its alot lighter than expected. I was hoping for a darker shade of grey. Also it was not the style as shown in the photo,the ends of the short roll up. It is comfortable and i will manage, get a size up if your looking for a bit of bagginess."
3.0,I tried it on & seems to run small & snug. I don't  know yet but will review as soon as I can! I will say nice & soft material!
3.0,Fit changes after wearing awhile
3.0,"Thought they were gonna be too small, but stretchy enough to work. And I mean, come on, the price is worth the risk. Only thing I don't care for is I cannot wear my rings and they won't quite fit over the material. But it is what it is and you can't go wrong with price."
3.0,"I really liked the style, but the length of the suit was too short. I am only 5'2 so this has never been a problem for me. It was also pretty tight in the bust area."
3.0,"Although I was able to fix it, the zipper came apart."
3.0,"These were a little more sporty than I was looking for and were a bit more fitted than what I wanted. I returned, but I can see how they would be a good purchase for workout wear."
3.0,Way more transparent lenses then I was expecting
3.0,"Loved the pins but had to hot glue way to many stars back on, open before the day of use"
3.0,Allergic :(
3.0,It still slips off. I wish the silicone was bigger and wider and not just thin lines of silicone.
3.0,"Very cute, fit everywhere but the chest."
3.0,No place for your arms to come out! So when you are zipped in you can‚Äôt pick anything up! Arms are unuseable. Could not hand out Halloween candy to kids! But had a ball with it!!
3.0,"I really like it, but it did break within a couple of days. I had to replace the hardware with some stronger links."
3.0,Flimsy design.
3.0,I wore it myself.Loved everything about the dress except the sleeves where too tight
3.0,It is a beautiful dress.  But it is very tight around the burst area maybe i should have ordered a x-large. But i ordered the large ordering the size chart which they said is a 10 or 12 in US.
3.0,The bag is fine except the strap is short. If the strap was longer it would be great
3.0,"Shirt runs a little small, I would size up"
3.0,"Goorin makes a good quality hat.  Be aware if you have a larger head.  On the last pin of the snap adjust, the hat was still uncomfortably tight.  Had to return."
3.0,"The texture of the sweater is kind of silky, it‚Äôs not very warm too"
3.0,"This is a pretty keychain, but it is much smaller than I anticipated. Also, the ring that holds the keyring to the little piece of art seems a bit flimsy and I fear it will and you'll lose the item."
3.0,Pretty but it was much too large and the sleeves were way too long.
3.0,It looks like an oversized sweatshirt
3.0,"They are too long, hoping they will shrink with the first wash...."
3.0,"I don't like the way this shoe was constructed. For some reason, my feet look very flat. It's hella weird."
3.0,"Digital screen went dead 30 minutes upon arrival. It was a great fit, loved the look but had to return it."
3.0,"Received all 5 pairs, however the ones my husband was looking forward to wearing were broke."
3.0,"Look kind of cheap.  I mean, they are cheap, so don't expect more."
3.0,"Product was delivered as stated and box was undamaged; however, one of the two pins was broke (end missing). Therefore, I cannot use the band. The original band does not allow the pin to be removed as it is encapsulated.<br />Though I cannot wear this metallic band yet, I can say that the magnet that clasps/connects the bands around my wrist appears weak. I estimate that a small bump just right will cause the band to open up and I will lose my smart watch."
3.0,"Overall just okay. More of a business causal top, versus a casual with jeans kind of top.<br /><br />U neck line was a little weird. Returned."
3.0,Nice fit. Material is a  bit cheap
3.0,I will wear it with a jacket because it is a lil tight.  I went by the size chart.
3.0,"I was little disappointed, I bought these as a second pair since I loved the black pants but to my surprise they were different. Pants were made from different material, to long, more like yoga pants. So beware that different colors may not be quite the same pair of pants. All colors show up as the VIV trouser collection, but are slightly  described  different. They are comfortable, just unacceptable to wear to work without long shirt."
3.0,"I was on the fence about this top. It's definitely a cute concept with the lace bottom and lace bell sleeves. I actually didn't notice that the sleeves were a bell shape in the photo. However, the way the lace puffed out beyond the fabric used on the body of this top just wasn't all that flattering. The lace is also really stiff and scratchy. I also felt like the length was a bit too long for me. I'm only 5'1&#34; though. In addition to all of that, the band across the top was such a tight elastic that it made it really easy for this top to pop up off the shoulders whenever you move. Yes, many off-the-shoulder tops do that on occasion, but this one was extreme. You'd basically have to sit like a statue for it to stay off your shoulders. I'm disappointed that it didn't work out, but it just wasn't for me."
3.0,"Amazing material, runs really big! I generally wear a Medium. I read reviews and decided to try a small but I wish I got x-small. Length was perfect for me which is usually not the case. I am 5'3 and it just brushes the floor. If you can get the right size the quality is pretty good especially for the price!"
3.0,"Over all I like this dress but I need to get a bandeau to go with is. I am a size 32DD and the straps do not cover everything that needs to be covered. I love the flow of this dress, and the material is good as well. I like it for the price that it is."
3.0,"Bought this and it seemed wonderful, at first, but the wire to the little onion broke.  Luckily, I was in my house so it happened there and I found the little onion as it rolled under the vanity!  Not sure how or who can fix it."
3.0,Came slightly bent in an envelope package. But was more disappointed that it‚Äôs just painted plastic. They do look kinda nice from afar though.
3.0,"They are soft and high quality, but the finger holes are way too tight.  Taking these off is difficult.  Unfortunately I can't return them, or I would because I can't really use them."
3.0,good. Returned did not fit Galaxy S5
3.0,"I bought these to prevent cuts and knicks while at work as I handle tools and bolts and nuts all day. Quite protective in this aspect, I think the protection pattern was well placed. It seems they wear out quick, also they get very slippery with just a little oil on them, you can't grab anything if this happens."
3.0,Nice shirt but I wear a medium or large. Ordered an extra large and is too small. I can't wear it.
3.0,Tight in the armpits and super long. Bought the size I would normally wear based on measurements and should have bought a size or two up. Super cute and realistic though!
3.0,"Okay, but the look is a little odd."
3.0,Keeps your neck nice and warm but should not be worn beyond the nose because the adjustable inner strings on each edge are too tight at its widest.
3.0,A better design can make the whole purpose complete
3.0,"Just got it, haven't used it yet but the zipper seems to get caught up a lot, not sure how long it will last."
3.0,"The product's finishing is acceptable,the craftsmanship needs to be improved.It will do the job it was bought for and i find the price to be on the high side."
3.0,"These are very cool looking and seem well made, but I can't read the computer screen with them. It might just be me, but they just seem like sunglasses with bifocal lenses, which they would work well for if that's what you need."
3.0,Se deslizan muy rapido
3.0,"4 of them were very fragile, and broke while i was putting them on. 3 horrendously smelled of mildew and made me nauseous, i had to throw them out. The remaining 8 are alright (though, JUST alright), the material theyre made from is fairly cheap and isnt too comfortable but its not much of a bother to me"
3.0,No fluffy enough. I sent it back.
3.0,"I am a frequent flyer from California to Ukraine and Russia. Therefore, such a jacket is a godsend for me, a very convenient format and style. But my big disappointment was too short sleeves. At first I ordered the Small size - when I moved my arms, the elastic of the cuff moved up to the bend of the elbow. Unfortunately, I took this jacket on a trip and could not return it.<br /> I ordered a size Medium upon arrival, hoping that the sleeve length might be suitable - but no! While the size is generally in line with the sizing standards, the sleeves are disproportionately short. Very disappointing.<br />Another addition is that this jacket's green is closer to khaki than to army green."
3.0,"It was shining gold color at beginning, and faded gradually."
3.0,Pattern is cute.  But the hem line-cut rides up in the rear.  Not flattering if you are somewhat tall.
3.0,"I purchased this ring to wear in place of my wedding set. I loved it while I looked nice but it started to wear in strange ways very quickly. The main stone is not open all the way, so it wasn‚Äôt as reflective as it could have been. The baquets on the side were a little dull.<br />I have taken great care of this ring, never wearing it while bathing or using my hands like washing dishes, etc and this weekend two of the side stones fell out.<br />I had expected more than 5 months of wear from this, but given the price I can‚Äôt be too upset."
3.0,the belt is a bit too tight. its a great belt but a bit uncomfortable. It is a nice belt.
3.0,"Very nice, leather seems very delicate but worth it"
3.0,"Really nice. fits well,"
3.0,Love the hat but poor quality fine for the price and makes a good conversation starter at work
3.0,"I gave this a 3 star because this product shipped on time and got to me way before the seller said it would,Unfortunately my daughter couldn't use it as this runs way too small and I would have ordered two sizes up,She is 4 and currently a 114cm,The 110 I ordered doesn't fit and it didnt look like a 120would either,I really should have ordered a 130cm."
3.0,Meh. i needed the red for a halloween costume. Way too big.  It ended up fitting fine after like 6 bobby pins. i wish they fit better because they‚Äôre super cute.
3.0,Mine broke quickly
3.0,Very big earrings
3.0,Not very sturdy metal. No way to hook on the top earlobe.
3.0,Fades after first wash but my daughter likes it!
3.0,"I presently care for an adorable, now 7 month old, who loves to pull her socks off and chew on them.  I purchased these in hopes I could keep her little feet covered, but not so.  This little Houdini managed to pull one off just a couple hours after I put them on her.  Now, it could be that she is simply patient and persistent, but definitely appeared to have no difficulty in removing one."
3.0,Had to return as the audio didn't work. I think the wires were broken. Did not ask for replacement. Return process was easy enough. Just wish they would have worked. I am going to go with a bluetooth version instead (wires just aren't very trustworthy).
3.0,First wear. There is a small hole by the knee area. This happened after one (1) hour of wear walking on the treadmill
3.0,Good band for the price. Latch or buckle is uncomfortable.
3.0,"Is it cute? Yes!  Does it keep my hair back? Yes!  Is it functional?  Maybe.<br />The main complain I have against this product is that unless placed perfectly towards the very front of the head, partially touching my forehead, it tends to fall off halfway through my jog.  It needs some elastic to help secure it.<br />I do like that it can be styled several ways, depending on how you place the logo.  The color is true to the picture, and I just rinse it off in the shower to clean it.<br />Would give it a perfect five if it didn't slip off so much."
3.0,Wish they were a little thicker in weight-not heavy just a little thicker.
3.0,"Too tight in the waistband for anyone without an extreme hourglass figure, and so badly attracts pet hair that I got rid of them. I am a pet owner that long ago accepted that my clothes will usually have some remnant of my pets on them. But I looked like I was wearing a lint roller."
3.0,Turquoise not blue Like I needed for 4th of July. But kid likes it.
3.0,Pretty but not much compression and they slip down after wearing a few times.
3.0,Too baggy on top and the way the skirt part fell I looked pregnant.  I was looking forward to this dress after reading such positive reviews and also a recommendation from a friend who owns it and loves it.  Definitely not for me.<br />For reference I am a 38DDD on top...so definitely shouldn‚Äôt be loose.  I bought XL...I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 190lbs.
3.0,They are difficult to see through. Mostly just wear them for show cause.. ya know... MURICA!
3.0,The gold flecked and tarnished within one month of ownership. Really cheaply made.
3.0,Chipped handle when I received.
3.0,So large they feel like granny panties.
3.0,"Top fit strangely, it was loose in the body but the bra cups were like cones. Kept it because the bottoms were nice."
3.0,There was no label attached to product or any paperwork in the package. Hopefully these are 14K white gold as advertised.
3.0,It‚Äôs so poorly made and it‚Äôs horrible
3.0,"I bought these foe my gf, and a she said thy fit small, but thy are comfortable,"
3.0,If you are a petite person it will fit you snug.? I can wear a 7.5‚Äù tennis bracelet but this is not even close.
3.0,"Very plastic-y. Quality is so-so, but that's what I paid for."
3.0,I dud work after a while at the beginning my glasses was blurry.  I was expected to work right away
3.0,I ordered the size I would normally wear. They are massively too big and drag the floor. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù.  They are comfy but huge. I was hoping they would shrink a lot but they have not.
3.0,"Not satisfied with the quality, too wide, no shape."
3.0,Shoe is pretty but much Narrower than expected. Could have used a 1/2 size up but Uggs aren't sold in 1/2 sizes.  Why?
3.0,Strange smell. And is kinda small.
3.0,very casual and runs bigger than expected
3.0,Regular.
3.0,Belt is as described.  Would really like to find one like this with a leather end tab.  Had one of these before and the end tab eventually peels apart.<br />Other than that it is an acceptable subsititute till i find one with leather end tab.
3.0,"I initially loved this bracelet, however, it tarnished very quickly and did not clean back up very easily."
3.0,The quality of the material is very nice...the shirt does run quite small so make sure to order up.
3.0,"Great Quality, just didn‚Äôt fit."
3.0,"Looks great, but only fits the original manufacturer band , no after market stuff"
3.0,"I would give this 5 stars, but the pattern is wearing off after 1 week. I'm so sad because I love it so much."
3.0,"This is really nice from a quality and fabric perspective. I‚Äôm an average sized woman and found it too wide; it wouldn‚Äôt stay up over my nose. Instead of returning it, I pulled out the sewing machine and altered it myself. The fit is better now, but I‚Äôll need to wait for my snow trip to know how it performs."
3.0,"low price, low quality. for 10 bucks can't complain. would be good for anyone looking to wear them less than 30 times."
3.0,"I love the colors in this dress! However, the fabric stretches weirdly across the bust, & is a little tight under the arms. I still wear this dress a lot though & get a lot of compliments."
3.0,"If you don‚Äôt like wearing low ponytails font but these hats. If that‚Äôs where you usually have your ponytail then these hats are great! Inexpensive, warm and obviously ponytail compatible."
3.0,Garter and stockings only. G string not included. Misleading.
3.0,my glasses end up rubbing under my beard
3.0,"Poor quality strap. I knew it wouldn't be the best but for $18+ I expected something a little better. The blue background is a little too bright and I don't think it looks very good. Fitting was off, but this was my mistake as this is a standard men's watch and I have small wrists, so it looked awkward altogether."
3.0,"Honestly it worked out for me, the only thing I didn't like about the item is that it fit a little tight in the under part of the suit and fit a little loose on the skirt part.<br />When its wet it streches out and hangs weird and the material is a little cheaper than I expected it to be. Overall i love the style and that it covers more than other swim bottoms."
3.0,I wish the front wasn't as &#34;tall&#34;. But I have received a lot of comments about it.
3.0,Fit too tight in the arms and chest. Unfortunately it was the largest size available. Good thing it fit my son.
3.0,"Sweater is super cute, fits well, warm. But the zipper is super janky‚òπÔ∏è Takes a bit of doing to line it up good enough to zip. I have no idea what the logo saysüòÇ"
3.0,Got it as a gift for my roommate and it hasn't broken after multiple uses
3.0,The glue comes off
3.0,"I thought I was getting a beige bra. The color was puke yellow, with bright red trim. Quality & fit was ok.<br />Immediate donation to Goodwill!"
3.0,Too small and the hat doesnt really fold down for the look it's supposed to give. Kinda just points strait up and looks dumb. Never gonna a wear it.
3.0,"While it‚Äôs cute and super soft, the fit is pretty strange, and my kid isn‚Äôt strangely shaped! I think it‚Äôs really just that the neck was Super Big, almost like it was stretched out. Overall not bad, though I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend to someone else unless they have a babe with a humongous head!"
3.0,There was a rip on the side of the pants
3.0,These did not work for my Pandora bracelet. They are pretty though! I would not purchase again.
3.0,It says ‚ÄúPink SATIN Ladies‚Äù on it.
3.0,my son wears a size 4 so that's what I ordered and they are way to big. he slips right out of them. we'll just hold onto them until his feet grow.
3.0,"I have bought multiple pairs of these pants in black. I have found them to be inconsistent with sizing, with the last pair fitting smaller than the pair I bought a month earlier. Materials seem to have changed. I want to love these as previous pairs have been comfortable and have decent stretch. Not so much anymore. The last pair I bought seems to fit more as a low rise pant and not what I‚Äôm looking for"
3.0,"Stitched on sides, cant see the eyes on one of them.<br />Only 1 of them is good where you can actually see that its a wolf. Other two are terrible.<br />(See pictures)"
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress after admiring it online for a few months before buying it but it just didnt flatter my shape. It was also missing a button. The material was thin and soft. I would definitely order a size down, I ordered an xl (I wear a size 8-10/large-xlarge usually) to accomodate my chest but I was swimming in fabric."
3.0,"Like that it's ""all in one,"" but the cell phone pocket I'd too small to hold the new larger phones. And, the coin pocket drops coins out on the side. Too late to return."
3.0,"It‚Äôs very pretty, and looks just like the picture! They only problem i encounter is that I‚Äôm a L size, but when it comes to this product, if you have curves, it won‚Äôt work for you because it keeps pulling up everytime you move, and it ended up looking like a short..."
3.0,"It was just a bit thinner than expected, but it was great for what I got it for"
3.0,"The hat was too small! Though it was very well made, lightweight and of exceptionally high quality, it was just too small for my fairly average-sized head. Its seems to be meant to be worn at the back of the head, with the brim facing up, as that was the only way I could get it to fit. Be wary!"
3.0,"Thin fabric. Very loose. Straps quite long. I had to cut 3 inches on each side to fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and weight 130lbs got small size. Length fit well, to ankles. Not worth for regular price. I got it at $7.20 so, it‚Äôs not bad."
3.0,"Looks great, but fits a bit large from the belly area."
3.0,i'm happy i got them but i wouldnt recommend them to somebody. they fit on my fingers weird but arent too uncomfortable or anything
3.0,"I purchased this for my daughter who played Katherine in Newsies.  The quality is great and I was happy with it. The only negative was I didn't realize the lyric/quote wasn't correct. It should say, ""We just might win."""
3.0,Good traction but hard to keep on feet.  Come off too easy.
3.0,"look good, and is cheap."
3.0,They are well made but the straps are very loose (I wear a size 8 and ordered an 8). They are fine for shower shoes but I would not want to walk around in them all day.
3.0,I'm writing this review because I received the wrong color/material than I wanted. I ordered a leather like material/ design (shown in screen shot) and received a suede kind of material. The shoes fit 100% true to size and they're gorgeous either way but I still wish I had received true to what I ordered in the picture.
3.0,It‚Äôs pretty but size up!
3.0,"They are beautiful, but these are not post back earrings, these are clip ons.  Will be returning."
3.0,The fabric is soft and it fits fin but unfortunately the pouch is half the size advertised in the picture and the baby kangaroo ü¶ò will not stay in‚Ä¶ Not as advertised! Returning it unfortunately.
3.0,They are VERY lightweight and function nicely. I need wide glasses and they are very comfortable. I just hope they hold up since they are so thin.<br />I will definitely need a hard case to store these in as I can see them breaking from the lightest pressure.
3.0,looks like it will break easily.  Glad that it was cheap!
3.0,"I was kind of disappointed while reading all the positive reviews and thinking these bra's were a sure win if I purchased them. Nope! I'm a 36A and this thing is tight. I'm not sure if it will stretch out eventually or not. But being a medium built women with a small chest. I was hoping being the &#34;one size&#34;' that it was. It would fit pretty well. It nearly looks like a junior style bra. I have side effects real bad with this bra. It's not very stretchy. I even took the pads out to see if that may help. Instead, I had no support at all to even keep me lifted. I felt as if I was going to fall out. I guess I'll just have to keep trying until I get it right. And when I do, I'm buying ten of them lol."
3.0,"This nose ring was very difficult to put in. It's hard to bend it back closed, and no matter what you do you won't get it &#34;closed&#34; all the way, leaving a gap. And when this gap works its way into the hole in your nose, the hoop can get stuck or just generally be painful/uncomfortable. It runs a little large as well. Not really a true rose gold either, looks more like normal gold with a very subtle rose tone."
3.0,I don‚Äôt know why I disliked this so much. I bought it with intentions of gifting it to my mother and if she didn‚Äôt like it maybe I would‚Äôve kept it but neither of us liked it at all. I know some people would love this but we did not
3.0,"Very generic, seems like they were made nice, but fit strange on the face."
3.0,Thanks I received it  Rosa
3.0,"If you are busty, buy a size larger because there is little to no stretch in that area and it is a tight confining fit. I unbutton the lower buttons. It looks cute though. The fabric is thankfully not sheer and looks nice layered underneath, although the texture is not particularly soft."
3.0,Best I've used so far but still not happy.
3.0,"I wanted this one to work but for me, it had too much rouching.  And I wasn't a fan of the silver beads on the straps.  I liked the pink/gray color combination."
3.0,"Belt was missing, shorter than they look on the model- mostly because I‚Äôm 6‚Äô, but they weren‚Äôt as pretty as i thought and without the belt, the top is a MESS. sent back"
3.0,"I returned them. I like Gant generally, but these were quite large and the blue frames are very bright and glossy, not my style at all. I would perhaps have kept them had the blue been darker, but it was almost gaudy, more like a royal blue. I think they are more suitable for women. I do like the polarized lenses."
3.0,A little cheap but good for the price
3.0,Fit like a crop top. Not long enough to tuck into even high waist pants.
3.0,It sheds would not buy again
3.0,"The slippers are comfortable and good for travel. The footbed is memory foam. I have 3 stars because the item description says it has a cotton lining in the footbed. It does not. Package label says &#34;All man-made materials&#34;. I prefer natural fibers and I don't know which man made materials were used. I wish I had read the fine print of the label before I removed it. I will use them for my trip because I have no choice. If you don't mind not knowing which materials are used than these are great, light weight, and soft slippers."
3.0,Cute but very thin and there were flaws along the waistline.
3.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 150 pounds. I ordered a large. I‚Äôm curvy- 34D and a generous base. The back of the dress covered my butt, but it was a close call.<br />The elastic around the shoulders is extremely questionable. It‚Äôs all rolled weird and didn‚Äôt stay at my shoulders. So, since this dress would not stay around my shoulders, it kept getting skankier as the day rolled on. I had to keep trying to pull it down, to no avail. I was very ready to take the dumb thing off. It‚Äôs a really cute dress for a picture or two, but not for much more than that. Also... I noticed the tag says dry clean only... how hilarious. I am not going to dry clean a $20 dress. That being said, it‚Äôs a nice dress for twenty dollars, just order a size up with hopes of not showcasing your goodies."
3.0,Love the color and feel. But band has already fallen apart.  Not well made
3.0,"They didn't stay in very well.  Was finding them in bed at night, and occasionally during the day I had noticed they had fallen out."
3.0,Small defect on shoulder of one of the mermaids? Would have sent back to exchange but it took so long to get here I figured easier just to live with it. Kind of bothers me though.
3.0,"Very comfortable, nice fit, but they remind me of 70's polyester pants.  Very shiny, but I will keep them for around the house."
3.0,This is our 2nd one in 5 months but I love the way they look on my husband. He likes them too.
3.0,There nice necklaces color is great also has a great weight to it. My only complaint is about the chain which (on all that I've looked at) have a few links that look like there about to snap even though they've never been worn. Not a big deal since they'll probably be fine for a while but something the seller should for sure look into.
3.0,Looked as shown but does run large.
3.0,I'm so mad! I purchased this for my niece and there was no USB cord in the box!
3.0,"Cute, but it was entirely too big. My husband agreed with another review that he didn't like it as it was table cloth like. I liked the colors but had to return an it made me look huge in it"
3.0,I love the color on it however this is a very very very light sweater. It‚Äôs not heavy at all. But it‚Äôs cute more for the style the material is great just light.
3.0,It's cheap so I received it with a weird metallic smell that i can't stand so i haven't worn this item yet or at all.
3.0,Order a size up other than that the item was beautiful
3.0,It was smaller around the waist and bigger in the chest than I expected. It's made of a nice thick stretchy fabric in a lovely color.
3.0,"I had to give this wig away, because it was too long. It looks better on the the person I gave it to."
3.0,The glasses do not sit very straight. I will need to have them adjusted.
3.0,"I ordered this for myself. When it arrived (late) it was more my daughter's size than mine (I ordered per the seller's size chart) and I don't care for the material it's made of (shiny, smooth material). My daughter loves it but I was very disappointed as it was meant for me and it's too late to order another. Would not buy from this seller again."
3.0,"Dress was cute, but the material was a little heavier than I expected for a summer dress."
3.0,"I really really wanted this dress to work. However, the sizing was way to small. And the fabric on the ruffling ripped immediately after I put it on. It‚Äôs super cute, but the quality isn‚Äôt great and you definitely need to size way up if you are a bigger chested girl, like myself."
3.0,"Terrible material , it was torn after trying it only"
3.0,"I had ordered what I thought was similar to this, before.  And the previous product was great.  This was thinner and not as well seamed.<br /><br />Also unflatteringly clingy."
3.0,"Nice, thick, absorbent sweatband. However, definitely not as big as advertised. Must be for a very small head."
3.0,"I really loved this necklace, it very pretty. However, it broke after a handful of wears."
3.0,I normally wear a large on top and medium on pants.  The top was too small and the pants were too big.  Pants were an easy fix for me because I know how to sew and it was easy to access the elastic and shorten it and re-sew into place.  The top was tight and would not allow for a shirt underneath.
3.0,Not enough storage for me. Returning.
3.0,It was a fantastic accent in a stocking
3.0,Material really really thin. See through.  Can wear a thin tank underneath. Sizing was true to size.  The wife will keep.
3.0,Would of like the eye bit was a littler bigger
3.0,"Really liked this product.  However, this morning it fell apart after 2 months of use!  For the price, I will probably buy another one and see if it lasts longer."
3.0,"I didnt like the fit, it was very &#34;frumpy&#34; and the style wasnt flattering"
3.0,"Love this shirt! It is so cute. The sizing was perfect and flowed really nicely, but I noticed after several washes it became a bit flimsy and widened where the buttons are in between."
3.0,"This is the second band (silver/gold) that I have ordered and they generally seem to last about a year.  No complaints about that, as I wear it every day.  I agree with some of the other raters in that a tool should have been included to do the adjustment.  I had one left over from the last band I ordered, and it broke because the pins in the band were in so tight.  So, along with the others, I will need to take this to a jeweler to adjust.  This band is huge and it should be disclosed that the buyer will need (most likely) to get the band adjusted."
3.0,nothing special they lasted me week and they started coming a part
3.0,As mentioned but strap is too big for kids wrist
3.0,"It does fit nice and has good support, but the underwires poke me sometimes.  They are not sticking out, they just feel kind of sharp and irritating.  If that was gone, the bra would be perfect."
3.0,"I love these, super comfy and exactly the length I was looking for‚Ä¶before I washed them in cold water, hung dry like suggested‚Ä¶.<br />These shrunk a good inch or two‚Ä¶they look like they the picture so not crazy short, but considering they were hitting the floor when I walked before it‚Äôs significant.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 almost 5‚Äô5, 140 lbs, for reference and ordered a large for comfort and room."
3.0,"Order UP, it runs small the LG is more like a MED."
3.0,I get my bf christmas undies every yr. they were cute but not really soft.
3.0,"Shoes are very cute. The sole cracked very quickly, but did not make the shoe unwearable. Generally, the shoes are okay, not super great for the money."
3.0,"First the colors are much lighter than in the photo. That really isn't an issue. The issue is that the skirt is MUCH longer than shown in the photo. I was expecting it to be knee length and it hits me at mid-calf. I am 5'9"" with pretty long legs, so it could end up even longer on other people. Also, the ruffles are not nearly as gathered as in the photo. If there was a way to adjust the gathers, then both the ruffle and length problem would be solved. All that being said, the skirt itself is well made and over all it's cute, just not exactly what I had been hoping for when I ordered this item."
3.0,Cute but seem to run a little small.
3.0,Top is not for the big breast!
3.0,"First, I‚Äôm short. At 62‚Äù tall I probably have shorter legs than most people ordering these socks. Because I‚Äôm short the elastic tops of these socks hit me in the middle of the knee which is not functional.<br /><br />So what‚Äôs a short person to do? The other socks made by this company with a higher level of compression are shorter - so get those.<br />Also, these socks came with a small flaw - a pulled thread in the middle of the leg."
3.0,"It's OK. Was very big and cannot be resized. Also, looks more like a wolf than a cat"
3.0,"Fits a bit larger than expected, but I guess larger is better than smaller.<br />My kid loves them, as Hank is his favorite from the movie.<br />They do not shrink much in the dryer like a lot of kids clothes, which is nice."
3.0,"Love the look of it, and it *works with exception*. Keeps time for a while, but runs slow so I have to continuously change the time if I want to use it for accuracy."
3.0,The material rides up and its really short.  Material is nice but it shows in the picture to be off the shoulder and there is no way it would hang off a shoulder the neck hole is to small.
3.0,"Pant is actually pretty cute.  Unfortunately once worn & fabric relaxes/stretches giant white thread show on the seams.  It is very noticable  on butt specifically and looks pretty awful.  if they were black or green it would have helped significantly.  Note that pants are not tight on me this is from normal wear.<br />Pants are cute but i cant wear again, its a damn shame."
3.0,the charm is cute but the chain length is awkward
3.0,"Was sent three normal cotton panties instead of the two items described here. Three stars for the fact they're nice undies of nearly equivalent price, so I kept them."
3.0,"The item looked good, but it was infant-sized."
3.0,"Cute design.  I ordered the XL, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10.  The sleeves were super short.<br /><br />I can‚Äôt imagine them working for anyone taller than 5‚Äô5 at the biggest size"
3.0,"This item was a little snug so I ordered the next sz up. The cut is great, love the sleeves how ever the material is stiff out of the box and difficult to iron and steam iron. Still trying to get the wrinkles out. May take it to the cleaners for them to try."
3.0,"They‚Äôre cheap, and heavy. Honestly they hurt my ears and vended very easily. Pretty, and just as shown however."
3.0,Not only it's small material sucks!!
3.0,The quality of the fabric is ok. The print quality is poor. Overprice given the quality.
3.0,"Bought this for my petite granddaughter.  The neckline was extremely large/low which made the dress unwearable for her.  Not for small, petite girls.  Except for the neckline, the dress would have been a nice addition to my jean-wearing granddaughter's wardrobe."
3.0,"Pendant is good but chain is garbage! Next time I will know better. Thanks for the great savings. REALLY??!! You want a review, DO NOT tell me how many words to type!!!!!"
3.0,"Very cute styling, I would suggest sizing down."
3.0,"Silicone rings are mostly used for safety, fashion and function.  This rig is designed to give way under stress so it good for mechanics, athletes, or anyone whose hands are an integral part of their vocation.  I like them as a change up for fashion ‚Äì it‚Äôs trendy and cute.  My problem with this ring is that the picture appears to be a thicker more substantial ring that it actually is.  I was a little disappointed."
3.0,Soft shirt but just an fyi. the pocket isn't real which looks a little cheesy
3.0,"Comfy and love the material, super lightweight, fit was just a size smaller than expected"
3.0,"chain was much shorter than pictured, as such it does not sit right and covers the skull (its about half the pictured length). i didnt like the design on the skull, but you can kinda see that there is one in the pics if you zoom over it. the size is nice, not too big but you can fit keys and a cell in there which is all i needed."
3.0,"The quality is fine and the confection too. It is very fancy but maybe a little bit small. If you are planning to put something larger tan an Ipad Air, forget about it."
3.0,white is very see through so I dyed it and it came out good!
3.0,"This shirt fits snug, like its a size smaller than marked on the tag. Fabric is good thickness. Length is good. The tag in the neck is 3 inches long and made of some kind of reflective, plastic thread, it feels like course sandpaper."
3.0,Nice dress for spring/summer. Nothing fancy just a comfortable dress to wear on a normal day. Not to short or to long hits right above my knees.
3.0,"The coloring is amazing,  however the stitching is awful,  plus the edges of fabric are showing,  as opposed to being folded in and stitched down,  which leads to threads constantly pulling off.  This jacket won't last through the washes."
3.0,The color is more a cream/ivory than a white.<br />I have broad shoulders but am smaller on top than my bottom. The bottom part of the dress fit great and the slit wasn‚Äôt too high up. The top part was a bit big and billowy even with broad shoulders. It felt like there was too much going on up top.<br />The dress was also a bit see-through so you‚Äôd need nude underwear and it would also need to be seamless. I returned it because it didn‚Äôt suit my needs and I didn‚Äôt want to have to get it tailored to fit the top. I think this would be a great dress in a darker color for someone with a larger chest
3.0,Hard to pit on and stretch out quickly.
3.0,"Good material, good quality. I read that they ran small so I sized up from a M/L to an XL. They aren't uncomfortably tight however they are way too short and rode up all day."
3.0,"This dress it beautiful! However, the bust is too small and the material was not as nice as it looks in the photo. It wrinkles easily. Cute dress however! Looks good."
3.0,Wish it was silver or black. The gold looks a little childish
3.0,They are much larger than expected...
3.0,I have ordered other bras in the past this one is nice but it doesn't give you the lift compared to the other sticky bras
3.0,"Thought these would be bigger. They said they were mens. Pretty decent material, not the cheap polyester junk"
3.0,After one day. It broke.
3.0,its a cheap neckless my son likes it but its bent a few time but for he like it
3.0,The bottom part of the bathing suit does not fit the behind. It's too large and saggy.
3.0,"I bought the vest for my slim  6 year old and it does seem to run on the bigger side, which I don't mind. I'm bothered that on the screen the navy blue vest looks like a true navy, however the one I received looks very purple. I don't mind my little boy wearing a purple vest...but if that's what I wanted that what I would have ordered... Ill probably give it to a friend and order something else."
3.0,"I ordered the navy blue scarf. It is a very pretty color, and I have not had any fading. This is a thin scarf, but good it is still good quality for the value. I do wish that it were bigger, but again, it is good quality for how cheap it was!"
3.0,I've only had this ring a few months and the stones are already falling out of it.  Too bad because it's super cute.  :(
3.0,I was looking for a silver too that didn‚Äôt look tacky. I love this one even though it was pricey. The fabric is beautiful but it doesn‚Äôt have nipple covers. Pretty
3.0,Cute but fits weird and runs a bit small.  Also made for very short people.
3.0,"These arrived with the chain and crystals separated from the clips of the earrings.  Luckily, I am familiar with jewelry making techniques and had the right tool to repair them and put them back together, but for anyone who is unable to do that, they would have been useless and would have had to be returned.  Once they were fixed, I was happy with them, they're very pretty."
3.0,"A random thread in the fabric...so that when the die is sprayed, it misses that spot and it now white when the thread moves...right in the front of the hoodie. Looks stupid. Ruins it. Bummer. Never worn."
3.0,"This dress is sort of cute, but really boxy. It looks like a big square with elastic at the top and sleeves just added on. I would not discourage someone from ordering, but its just not for me."
3.0,"It makes my belly bigger.  I thought it was going to shed, but not showing my belly."
3.0,I though this was big but this is very very tiny!
3.0,Slides off your head to easily
3.0,"I, like you, have clawed through hundreds of pages of poorly rated replacement bands for the Gear Fit 2. I, too, have screamed and sworn at Samsung for not selling any god damn OEM replacement bands that will actually fit onto their otherwise amazing smartwatch.<br /><br />This band, which wraps around the Gear Fit rather than attaching in the normal fashion, is guaranteed to fit your Gear Fit 2. There is no concern that it won't snap on or that the snaps will break, since it's just stretchy rubber that wraps around your Gear Fit 2.<br /><br />However, this band is not without its flaws:<br /><br />1. You cannot charge the watch while this band is around it<br />2. The way that the band buckles is inverted compared to normal watches. I don't know how else to explain it. This makes it significantly more difficult to attach the band to your wrist, although once you have it secure, there is no little tail sticking out that could catch on things and cause the band to detach<br />3. This band has a large metal snap which will be in direct contact with your skin. This gives me a severe eczema reaction after wearing the band for about 24 hours. As such, I cannot recommend this to anyone who has allergic or eczema reactions to metals."
3.0,Decent product.  I felt the padding was too small.  Really only marginally helps.
3.0,"UPDATE: As an update, I have to say this bag drops a star. I've had the bag since the end of May 2016. I've stopped using it as of the end of February 2017. At this point I think it's too faded to look nice. I didn't even use it daily. By the time I went to Disneyland in December, it was already faded, but the walking at Disneyland really did it in. It was handy to have such a big bag (big to me I'm very used to using small purses) to put everything into for my trip, but I wish I hadn't taken it. It faded everywhere. I'm adding pictures to my review to show the fading. I still really love this purse it's really cute and I definitely got compliments on it while it still looked nice but now it just looks old and beat. Not sure if I'd buy it again or not.<br /><br />I absolutely love this bag. The print is vibrant and adorable. I like the sizes of the inside pockets, they're bigger than most purse inside pockets. The handles are solid, and you can remove the long strap, but I wish I could also remove the handles. I use it much more as a cross body bag, and it would be really convenient if the handles weren't in the way when I use the long strap. I'm used to using much smaller bags so this is basically Mary Poppin's bag for me. My one complaint about this bag is that when it's not completely full it crumples in on itself. Whether it's open or zipped shut it folds if there's not stuff holding it up. I wish it had been wired or supported somehow. I now have some stiff jewelry wire holding the sides up and it helps an absolute ton. Otherwise it's a great bag and I've gotten tons of compliments on it!"
3.0,These pajamajeans are comfortable and fit nicely when first putting them on.  After a flight to Europe they were way too loose.  Beware that they become baggy after sitting for a ten plus hours.
3.0,Really to large for me to handle.
3.0,"Wish it was a bit longer , orher than that great!"
3.0,They kept sliding out of my ears. They didn't come with backs.
3.0,"They are warm, a misdge tight (I wear a size 7) around the ankle, but the worst think is when you put them on, your toenails (big toe and little toe) seem to grab every strand inside. Maybe wear them turned inside out?"
3.0,"The problem with this purse is that it is too soft.  When you open it, everything inside your purse is visible to anybody who happens to be standing near you.  Things also want to &#34;fall&#34; out easily too.  What drew me to this purse was the many, many compartments for your things, that is a great feature, however, the &#34;floppy&#34; part of it is not what I want in a purse."
3.0,Liked color. Short-waist. Fabric not what i expected.<br />Sorry!
3.0,They fit well and are semi comfortable but I hate that they come untied alot .
3.0,"Such an adorable romper for my baby girl.  From the crepe material, to the sweet little girl design to the ruffles around the shoulders to the buttons down the front chest to the beautiful green color, this was such a lovely outfit for my baby girl during the holidays.  She wore it over some ivory leggings and of course wore the cute bow on her head and it was a baby show stopper.<br />The only thing I‚Äôd complain about is the fit around the neckline‚Ä¶<br /><br />FIT:<br />The length fit well (my baby has a longer torso) and it fit her without being tight around her diaper crotch.  The elastic at the leg openings fit well.  The length of sleeves and elastic around the wrists also fit well.  But the neck opening gaped open and could have been taken in by a good 4‚Äù.  When she wears this again I‚Äôll need to sew it or somehow clip it.<br /><br />Material:<br />I just love this type of woven material on a child.  There is something so innocent and soft about the look.  For the most part it washed well and just got more textured which was nice because I didn‚Äôt need to iron it.  Ask me to iron my baby‚Äôs clothes? No thank you, who has time for that.<br />In my photos you can see the prewashed garment (shown with tags) compared to the after wash.<br />the color faded slightly but not as drastic as what the photos show... that was just difference in my lighting.<br /><br />Design:<br />Did I say this was adorable?  The buttons in the front chest are functional buttons, allowing for easy of pulling over head.  The drawstring at the waist is for looks only.  The bow is a long strap in the same material and is just tied to the head anyway you‚Äôd like.  It was just long enough to tie a balled up bow.<br /><br />3 stars out of 5 only due to the weird fit around the neck.  If they were to fix that, this would be hands down a 5 star."
3.0,"Not as durable as it looks,preferable to have the silicon guard to protect the case"
3.0,"Ordered an xxl,  and it is smaller than should be in the waistline.  Sleeves fit perfectly."
3.0,I really like the color of the lens. The frame feels cheap though. Feel like it was overpriced.
3.0,Looks and feels kinda cheap... wish there was more flower bits...the wooden parts doesn't look... woody... its barely ok...
3.0,Two pair were fine.  The other two pair the frames were slightly bent.
3.0,Feel okay looks great
3.0,"Pretty dress, just didn't fit right so I had to return it."
3.0,The dress is beautiful unfortunately it is a bit tight in the bust area. The dress is  a nice length reaching the ankles.
3.0,"Dress runs large. My problem though is that the skirt is not as full as pictured; I couldn't even wear a crinoline under it - I bought it because it appeared that I could.  Putting a crinoline under it, make the skirt look like a 'bell', no movement at all. Had to return it."
3.0,"My mistake, I thought it was a Betsy Johnson ring, but it's a knock-off. Cute enough, kinda cheap, it does adjust as long as you have bigger fingers. This will not fit small size 6 ring fingers."
3.0,Very fast shipping. Doesn't look as exactly pictured but it's still beautiful. Runs pretty small. Not as long as pictured either. The split also runs in the middle. I'm still keeping it because it actually is pretty either way.
3.0,I loved this dress. Mostly. The sleeves were a little tight and the bust was too loose but it fit everywhere else. I had ordered a size larger because some of the reviews said that it runs small. It would have been the perfect dress if the bust fit better and the sleeves were looser.
3.0,"Very pretty color, but poor quality fabric and not quite what I was looking for.  This would be a good maternity shirt maybe"
3.0,Ordered for some else
3.0,These are cute and have good adhesion! BUT if you are planning to separate them out into individual pairs for gifting or using by different children just know it is almost impossible to do. They are glued to the single piece of cardboard and the paper gets mangled when removing.
3.0,It‚Äôs are great product. It‚Äôs tearing up now  because I‚Äôve over stuffed it.
3.0,I wear a size 10 shoe and have average width feet. They did not work for me as they were to shirt and the toes didn't fit right.
3.0,Stones in small ring looked blue but are purple. Gold is a little too bright.
3.0,I sized up as reviews said but they were too big im 5 ft around 185 usually a 17 or 1x to 2x in pants and the 3x was way too big but they were good quality also too long but im very short
3.0,[[VIDEOID:e97980e8a6161f36c16336e69c84af27]] Video speaks for itself! Clearly both say medium on the tags and clearly they are not the same size! They sewed in the wrong tags in their sweatpants. No one knows any of the real sizes where you're buying these from! üòèü§™üòÇüëé
3.0,Cute pattern. Top fits small but pants fit fine. Material feels itchy even after washing.
3.0,"It is odd, I do not remember I purchase this item, for some reason this item is in my purchases basket,  because out of my budget, and it is not necessary. But the item is very good, a little bit small, I do not have time to return this item. For this reason, I keep it."
3.0,It slips through out the day.
3.0,woulld have been better if it was larger
3.0,"Be careful on the size‚Äî I got a medium and it was pretty dumpy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 132lbs, 32C. The material is like a cheap sheer style so not a super comfy feel, but if it looks cute on you then that‚Äôs the real clincher."
3.0,They were ok but for the price not bad
3.0,Cute but don‚Äôt stay tied and grab to the metal cling on the other shoe. My daughter tripped wearing these multiple times. Returning.
3.0,"Very cute, but sizes are weird.<br />Pants were way too long, shirt was just right, and the vest was too small."
3.0,They‚Äôre great beside the lens quality. Mine came with permanent scuffs on them. Seems like a production error. I tried reaching out for an exchange but the company didn‚Äôt resolve unfortunately.
3.0,Adoras and fit perfectly except for the waist. Ordered a medium. 5‚Äô6 and 135. Returning and reordering in a larger size.
3.0,Super thin. Can see right through.
3.0,"Cute, but way too big and not eligible for return"
3.0,"Loved the design & material, but the sizing was so off from what I've had from other brands, I had to return it. Runs VERY small."
3.0,"I live the shirt but the fabric is unwearable. Very itchy. Also something I didn't notice when purchasing, the sleeves are permanently sewn into a 90s cuff."
3.0,Suit with the price... fair enough
3.0,Bought two straps. One that had the push button release is great - this one just snapped in place and was not nearly as good. I actually put this on a cheaper watch that I dont wear so much
3.0,"Very lose, did not fit properly"
3.0,It's a baggy fit also doesn't have back pocket
3.0,"The sizing was perfect - not too large or too small, just right."
3.0,It's smaller than your average large. Also I thought the pants legs were longer like the picture but they stop closer to the knee..cute tho
3.0,this is for 6 and under.
3.0,Ok sweater
3.0,"The tie is extra long, but the color is off. It doesn't look like the picture. The picture is more brown/gold, when you get it, you'll barely see this. Also the texture of the tie is not silky soft, it's actually kind of rough. Either way can't beat the price...."
3.0,Will shrink if washed in a machine and dried. Sized small in the first pace so washing makes it worse.
3.0,"Wear this for my gym workouts. Fit is good, looks good. Only problem is taking it off from my sweaty body due to it‚Äôs clinginess."
3.0,Nice dress but it DOES NOT have pockets which was a big reason I ordered this dress.
3.0,A little tight and suffocating but very pretty.
3.0,This dress is well made and fits nicely! I work as an event planner and need pockets so I excitedly bought it! This dress is true to size and is cute...but if you wear spanx under this dress and plan to walk around.. the fabric of the dress has a little friction with the spanx and causes this wierd traffic cone of fabric to ride up my thighs and it kind of looks like I am pitching a tent! I gave it another shot after washing it but it still rides up and so I kept my hands in my pockets a lot! I ordered a similar dress but with a less cottony bottom and I had no problems with ride up! I have not tried it without spanx- so it may be just fine without them!
3.0,This shirt is just okay. It‚Äôs more of a home business quality vs. a legit screen print authentic merchandise quality. The colors are also a little off and shirt rather thin.
3.0,I asked for boys xl..got a men's xl. Fabric not that great but good enough for price
3.0,Chain was too cheap looking
3.0,"i like the size of this bag, however it looks like the straps will break if packed too much on a daily basisSatisfied with my purcahse"
3.0,the picture doesn‚Äôt show the two high slots on both sides. the dress wasn‚Äôt as flattering in person as in the picture. but it‚Äôs comfy
3.0,"The fabric used and the physical appearance of these socks has changed.  The quality, overall, of these socks has diminished a good deal.  The fabric and finish are both cheaper while  the price has nearly doubled.  Gotta find a new source for my Ted's now.  I won't be buying Futuro again."
3.0,Didn‚Äôt read the description well so I had to send this back. There is only one cuff and it was a little bulky for mrüôÉ
3.0,"This shirt is comfortable and easy to care for, but it looks like a surgical scrub top. The style is very similar to scrubs."
3.0,Too thin but however very cute at night.
3.0,"It fit before washing andThe material is soft, so I like that, but after the first wash the neck is already starting to stretch out, so it not offering protection from the cold around the neck."
3.0,Edges were a little sharp. Was a gift she said she liked it
3.0,"Love the look!  The reason I only gave it three stars is because I had to make it smaller,  and now the pins won‚Äôt stay in."
3.0,I'm 91 lbs and 5 ft exactly and this skirt didn't fit :( my soul hurt so much
3.0,"Nice looking a little large, but not too much. Looks nice on my finger."
3.0,This purse is great but it isn‚Äôt big at all and if you have a long wallet then I suggest getting a bigger purse.
3.0,Not as shiny in person but will do the job for a night out.
3.0,just fit kinda weird
3.0,Has a nice look and feel but dose not stay tight around my wrist when working or even rakeing the yard
3.0,Pilling on the hood area on both sides of the neck. Happens after twice worn. Happens quite frequently with the hood down. This is the fourth hoodie From Russell. Something needs to be added to the fabric on the front hoodie area to prevent this.
3.0,Bought an adult large fits like a medium
3.0,The onesie is wide and short. Not made very well.
3.0,"The saying is ""I feel about you makes my heart lone to be free.""<br />What in the world does that mean? It's made nice and I love giraffes so I just broke the saying off and trashed it."
3.0,"They are see through. I was super bummed out about this because I thought the point of them was to make your booty look good. But... unfortunately, I cant wear them for that purpose because of the sheer fabric."
3.0,"I am very hippy, but it still passes over my hips.  Nice, but I probably will return for a different color."
3.0,"This is a pretty jacket, but the fabric is cheap polyester. It can be hot and there is something about the colors that are not true. I like the style though. I ordered up and didn't need to, it is quite roomy."
3.0,It was too large. I returned it requesting a smaller size but got a refund instead. ???
3.0,"The dress was too small on top for my daughter, also the lining of the skirt is about 8 inches shorter than the outer layer. The lace is also less delicate than it looks like in the photo."
3.0,Its ok but put black quickly.
3.0,Dress was way to short - my friend ordered one that was long enough so she picked me out one and it was probably 6 inches shorter the the details said.
3.0,Great gift  I ordered 4 and only got 3 that was disappointing.
3.0,"Cute and very easy to slip on and off. The other reviews are correct though, the flashers at the bottom stopped working within a few days."
3.0,I love the material and color design but the dress was longer than i imagined and came up pretty high on the neckline. maybe i should‚Äôve ordered a smaller size but i just wasn‚Äôt feeling it on me at all.
3.0,Great for small kids i.e those 5-6 and under.  The designs were cute but they did not for my 8 year olds :-(
3.0,"I purchased the Besteel Jewelry Mens Leather Wrap Bracelet from Besteel intending to give it to my boyfriend. The product came in in a very timely manner and was delivered without any issues or without any damages. The bracelet did have a funny smell to it at first, like plastic mixed with leather, but that went away after a while. For being a bracelet marketed towards men, I expected it to be bigger. We had to put it on the last set of fasteners, and it was still a bit tight. The leather was also very stiff and because of how wide it is it made it awkward to move around with. He said it just was not very comfortable and although it looked nice it wasn't really something that could be worn for too long without irritation. It's okay, just nothing special.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have received and fully used the product before posting this review. My review is one-hundred percent of my own opinion and not influenced by the seller, Amazon, or any other outside sources."
3.0,"They're OK, but they're a little longer than I prefer.  I like shorts to hit at or slightly above the knee.  These were slightly below the knee."
3.0,"Based on the picture, I expected more of a matte finish vs the very bright/shiny finish it has.  It's ok I guess but limits when I can wear it."
3.0,"bonita, ligera, c√≥moda pero... queda un poco grande y no ajusta perfectamente."
3.0,Nice oversized eyewear.
3.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but it‚Äôs very difficult to adjust the band. You have to pull quite hard on it and it‚Äôs a pain to readjust if it‚Äôs too large or small."
3.0,There is no size listed on this. Looking at the picture it appears you can wrap it around your neck a few times but not so. You actually can‚Äôt wrap it around one time so I‚Äôll just let it hang at Trump rally. Otherwise it‚Äôs very nice quality and very pretty.
3.0,they slip off in the shoe
3.0,"Not cotton. It is a polyester, spandex mix. Slick and stretchy material.  I like that it has pockets."
3.0,love them but no support good for smaller people
3.0,"Love the inside material, and the look was decent. wears well jeans."
3.0,"This bag could be SO great... but it's got some improvement needed. One, a fully leather strap, without the other part, would be a better style choice. But I knew that when I ordered it and did anyway. The parts I wasn't expecting and didn't love - the parts where the strap clicks on squeak... a lot. It sounds like I'm walking around with a baby bird in my purse. Trying to think of a way to fix that. And second, the panels are vastly different. I get that it's a weathered bag, and they aren't all the same, but the one I got is more of a quality issue where one panel is scratchy and much much lighter/more weathered. I managed to get it a bit closer with brown shoe polish, hopefully it doesn't rub off on my clothes. If the bag ever recovers from &#34;Jen Hatmaker recommended it&#34; supply shortage, I hope they make those minor improvements. All that said, it smelled nice when I got it, I love the zipper on the bottom to expand if necessary but keep flat most of the time, and it's shaped well but not yucky stiff. Overall cute and I'll be taking it to Europe & Mexico."
3.0,It was larger than I expected. There seems to be a bit of extra material in the back that is not affected by tightening the laces. I will likely return it or see if someone else in my family would be interested.
3.0,"It's a nice looking belt. It was brown when it arrived even though the photo was blue. Regardless, it's a thick belt but still light. You will wear this belt out. The leather is okay but it is already showing marks where cinched. I already had a brown belt much like this so I gave it to my little brother who loves it. It's simple but has some thread accents that look nice."
3.0,"These bras run small. Buy a size larger band, maybe even a cup size larger. Pretty bras, but were too tight."
3.0,"Waist is a bit tight as there is NO stretch. The fabric itself is very stiff. Wear in public with caution or flaunt it on purpose... if you know what I mean. If you don't know what I mean, I mean that the skirt is a bit short and bending over is not an option haha"
3.0,The shoes are just what I had hoped they would be; but they are far to narrow.<br />I shall have to return them:(
3.0,"Very small, thought it was larger. but does work"
3.0,Bought the dress to wear to a wedding. Definitely can‚Äôt wear to a wedding because the length. More of a club length dress. Nice thick fabric but way shorter then the picture or description says. Even shorter then the picture reviews. Fits well in the chest. Stomach area is a little loose but hips fit well.  Only complaint is how short the dress is. It‚Äôs more of a mini dress. I ordered the xs size and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3‚Äù and this is a mini dress for my height.
3.0,"Really cute necklace. Perfect size for a child. The only downfall is the &#34;rope&#34;. Yes, its adjustable, but for a small child it needs to break away in case of emergency. If it were to get caught or hung up on something while on a child, ideally I would prefer it break so I did just use the pendant."
3.0,"These come unsnapped very easily. They're cute, but I don't wear them because they'd probably just fall out during the day."
3.0,I'm happy with the item but I ordered a Medium. The shirt came in medium but the pants were marked small. They do fit the person they were for so its all good but I'm not too happy about getting a different sized pants.
3.0,"It fit as expected but for some reason, mine has a nude cloth under with the teal sheer fabric over it. It isn't too noticeable but it definitely isn't as pictured...."
3.0,not of the best quality.  the clasps are flimsy.  it is a cute bag for $20.
3.0,We loved this shirt. My ten year old was obsessed with it until a few months later it had shrunk so much we had to toss it.
3.0,Shirt fits baggy but still cute. Need to offer an XS.
3.0,"I think if A. it wasn't a giant tent and B. it didn't take two weeks to ship to me, therefore making it insanely frustrating to get another one, it might be fine."
3.0,They wouldn't fit the chains to hold them. opening too small
3.0,"I wear a watch cap the traditional Navy way, and found the total height , or length of the cap was a little short."
3.0,"I ordered a XXL because I am very well endowed. The bottom fit like a dream (i wear size 10/12 in pants) the top, however, barely covered a nipple. I am a 38DDD and I tried it on my boyfriend just for craps and giggles and it fit him (haha) and he wears a size small in everything. The bottom is so cute so I will just have to find another top."
3.0,"Nice,  but i needed longer"
3.0,feels more like a umbrella type of material but is cute
3.0,The sizes run small so size up
3.0,"Beautiful but strange fitting because it seems they‚Äôve constructed it for ta-tas to be in center way too much and no woman is built that way. It also bellows out on the front inside edges of cup material like it‚Äôs too big but is snug everywhere else. Was thinking maybe a smaller size would work but then it would be too tight everywhere else. It‚Äôs really a shame because this bra is absolutely beautiful and seems high quality made but is just too oddly constructed. Really wish this would fit because I love it, but sadly it does not."
3.0,"Fit is fine, but some seems pulling apart already.  And it is still itchy."
3.0,Good quality. Size not even close.
3.0,"Love the color, but the hat is too big even with adjusting the back the velcro does not fit so I try to tuck it under. The hat is real flimsy, but guess it has to be if your gonna be running. needless to say i just keep it on the hat rack cause I can't wear it."
3.0,For me this dress was a little big. In the back I could grab a handful of fabric. I ordered a 12 plus and would have gone down a size. My waist is 32&#34; and bust is 38&#34;.
3.0,Thin waist band only reason I didn't like. Not returning also at same time ordered wider waistband like very much.
3.0,"Cheap looking, The different pieces do not stay as well put together as they appear here. Was warned in review about the clasp. But purchased anyway for a specific party. Works for very little use."
3.0,First of all my daughter LOVES these shoes. It is currently winter and she wants to wear them everyday. She has only gotten to wear them around the house twice. The decals on the toes are starting to peel off. I imagine that after wearing them for an entire day it will slowly start to get worse. My daughter finds them to be comfortable though.
3.0,"This dress is made very small. The lace top requires a camisole, which is okay, but the bottom part of the dress is extremely sheer. It will require another slip or even leggings underneath. Also, you get what you pay for: the seams are extremely raggedy and the quality is not very good on this dress."
3.0,The sweatshirt is soft and comfortable and very attractive looking. It is however quite thin for a sweatshirt so not for really cool days. I did pose a question about whether it was really a sweatshirt and the response was it is sweatshirt material.  It is but thin. I washed and dried it and it shrunk an entire size. I bought a large because I like sweatshirts to be big. This shrank to a medium and fits more snuggly now.
3.0,The masks are not tie dye at all. I‚Äôve put some in the car just to have extras if needed. They fit large around the face.
3.0,"I love this bag. It's the best one I've ever had. The size is perfect and it's not too heavy. The zippers work well. The strap is a good length. I couldn't give it 5 stars, though, because after only a few months the fabric ripped in 4 places. It hasn't affected the function so far, but it doesn't look great. The ripping continues to get worse every time I use it now. There are two in the front and two in the back."
3.0,I bought the size that corresponded with the bust area and the whole dress was too big.
3.0,Again this just is a great length pretty modest in design but the arms were too tight... hoping that a size up will help
3.0,Order 2-3 sizes up
3.0,"Purchased as gift, stones are VERY small. Disappointing. Pretty for a child, but not an adult."
3.0,"It fits good but I don't care for it.I don't like the material,its too synthetic"
3.0,Loved it but turned fast
3.0,"I do really like the look, but it's huge on me. I'm going to need to sew in a lot of reduction foam. I don't have a tiny head. I'm maybe a Small/Medium. Certainly not XS. But it IS very cute and flattering. I don't look good in many hats, but this one will work once I get it to fit right."
3.0,I thought it would be more grey.. its literally blue. Fine for a swimsuit cover up.
3.0,Returned.  Did not easily hold necessary cards.
3.0,I understand the porportions but I felt that I would constantly have to worry if the top was showing. I also felt like the bottom of the circular part didn‚Äôt give support and would fall off. The first time the adhesion was strong but the other times I felt it would fall off.
3.0,"So much static, no matter what input on the fabric the static electricity doesn‚Äôt go away :/"
3.0,"This is not a sweatshirt, not even a lightweight one.  It's a thin t-shirt material.  The material is soft and feels good, but if you are wanting something to keep you warm, this will not.  It's a little big, boxy, but oddly short waisted.  For the price I paid, I will keep it, I like the style and feel, but will not be able to use it for working/playing outside in cold weather as planned."
3.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 160 lbs 36-40 D (6 weeks postpartum and nursing) and the bottoms are super long. The material is soft.
3.0,These are nice but they are all one color. Not three. All the bottom color.
3.0,"The Good: This bra is attractive, and cheap!  The fabric is pretty nice.  It looks great on.  I normally wear a 34-36B.<br /><br />The Bad: The size 36 fits like a 32-34 when on the largest set of hooks. It did come with an extended, so that helped.<br /><br />The Ugly: The shoulder straps. Even adjusted to the longest length, they cut into my shoulders badly. I had another set of straps I could use, so this is not a total waste, but be aware the straps are ULTRA short."
3.0,They were too small. I‚Äôll b returning them
3.0,"The robe itself is good as a coverup, with decent quality materials. However I use size L and XL and this robe is an XL and did not close in the front. I am disappointed as it is cute, soft, and lightweight. I wish it was truly XL."
3.0,Smaller than expected.  No give in the band.
3.0,"This purse is really nice but I can't get over the smell, it smells like fish!! Seriously. I should have listened to the other reviews."
3.0,"These are ok, but wish the fabric was not so thin."
3.0,Its decent. The sleeves are so short. I sized up and not as baggy as I wouldve liked.
3.0,"Floor length for my 5‚Äô3 height. Thick, quality feeling material but bust area is too large and gaps around armpits- my bust is 34C. I bought a medium but should have gone with a small."
3.0,Material was not as shown in photos
3.0,"I received a hat with a rimmed crown and a ""Z"" on the front. I bought this because two of the three pictures (including the main one) show a flat crown and no writing on the hat. While the last picture shows a different crown, that is easily missed and not listed in the description.<br /><br />Sadly, my husband peeled the writing off to placate me, so no pictures..."
3.0,"Good cheap sandal, but if you are using them for walking around, I'd advise against it.  I bought them specifically for locker room/shower usage, and I wouldn't be surprised if they fail in a year or so.  You can see the glue where the footbed meets the rest of the sandal.  But for $10, not too bad."
3.0,I can't complain about the quality. It is very good! But I received a totally different beanie than the one in the picture. It was another tone of grey and had another pattern. I can still use it though.<br />Disappointed since I expected a lot for North Face!
3.0,"Really pretty, wish it was easier to open. It also doesn't slide to make it shorter or longer as easily I thought it would"
3.0,The hat is nice but it's a bit small for a regular 2 year old.
3.0,Pretty cheap material.  The markup on this is way to high.
3.0,"Description says 100% Modal, but the elastic band is covered in a thin layer of modal, the elastic is clearly visible when worn.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Nice, hard to find low waistline style<br /><br />- Comfortable when FIRST worn<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Not made for athletic use<br /><br />- Cant be worn for an entire day without discomfort after a few hours<br /><br />- Pouch is small and doesn‚Äôt expand as much as needed, which leads to compression around that area (not a good feeling)<br /><br />- Straps are thin and don‚Äôt support as expected<br /><br />- Made in China and measurements are not 100% accurately translated<br /><br />Overall, these are made for occasional use - not daily use."
3.0,It was late but it arrived I loved it definitely not silver 925 but I do think it's like Stainless Steel good quality strong
3.0,Love the necklace but the chain has gotten oxidized.
3.0,"I loved these at first, had to use pliers to adjust the tightness of fit. Sadly, after weeks of wear, they loosen and turn, negating the reason for using them. Shame, great idea."
3.0,This one came with that sticky protection liner.... we could get it off. It wouldn't just peel off so we worked on it a little bit every day pealing parts off it. After about a week we got it off. Suit is pretty
3.0,"The mirrored version is taller and gives contents a classier look. This one costs less, but lacks visual oomph. I'd rate this higher were it a few bucks less."
3.0,the material and look of the fabric is way dif in person than the picture
3.0,These would be good for people with narrow feet.
3.0,"not what I thouiht or hoped it would be but four dollars what wiould one expect , My wife iikes it and that's all that matters to me"
3.0,So the gauge in theses seems closer to an 18 and it's rather annoying that the post unscrews both from the earring and the fastener.  All in all good buy but I can't get half the earrings apart to put them in.
3.0,Too heavy b4 I put my 'stuff' in it!
3.0,I returned this product because I didn‚Äôt like the strip of elastic they had sewn in the waist band.
3.0,"These shoes will never fit a four-year-old or higher...terrible description, had to return."
3.0,Cheaply made and it's a bright pink not as pictured
3.0,"Looks like a lounge outfit, not dressy"
3.0,"Had to return.  I wear larges in general, but couldn‚Äôt get this zipped.  Very disappointed."
3.0,"The shoes are comfortable enough, the wide width is adequate. The memory foam sole is comfortable but I still need arch support for my high arches. My biggest complaint is that after only the 3rd or 4th wearing, the right shoe is now making a sound like an abused squeaky toy whenever I take a step. They'll be fine for home or for solo walks, but I wouldn't want to wear them to the gym or to run errands due to the noise."
3.0,Quality ok. Measurements around thigh area are uneven on both sides and makes it uncomfortable
3.0,I like the color as it‚Äôs hard to find dark blue. The socks were a nice weight but they would creep down and didn‚Äôt stay up on me.
3.0,"I only gave it a three because when they finally came in the mail, they were the size of nickles.  They were HUGE!!!  But they were very pretty, so I guess they are okay."
3.0,Didn't like the fabric and feel this will pill quickly.
3.0,"Basic flip flops, used them back & forth to the pool for 3 months before they started to discolor. Won't clean up."
3.0,"Okay so I‚Äôm completely torn between returning this and keeping it. The material this dress is made of is kinda difficult to work with and keeping that in mind it has been finished in the seams beautifully. No holes, no frays, no zigzag lines just wonderful seamstress work until the skirt liner. The skirt liner is weird and wonky and seams like an afterthought and a poorly executed one. The material is kinda sheer so it‚Äôs needed but it doesn‚Äôt come past my butt. I wish it was just lined like the front of the top then I wouldn‚Äôt be so on the fence. I guess I‚Äôll decide whether to send it back or break out my sewing machine and try to fix it. This dress is way too beautiful and well crafted for this kind of oversight."
3.0,"Don't get me wrong - these are comfy, work well and not bad looking - but the nose piece quality just isn't there. It's tiny wires that bend easily, not up to any normal wear & tear.  This is my main complaint.<br /><br />Glasses of this quality should be a LOT cheaper."
3.0,"very cute, but since it's way too large I'm going to have to exchange it. I generally wear a XL, can squeeze into a L but they are pretty tight. ordered the XL and it's way too big (granted I have a smaller chest so if you are more endowed maybe that would help the fit). so order a size or two down. I'll update when I get the exchange done, looking forward to wearing it!"
3.0,"I was going to wear on my vacation, unfortunately to small!"
3.0,"I don‚Äôt care for the polyester material & the zipper got a little stuck, but for the price and my fake Nike add-on...football Sunday‚Äôs are fun."
3.0,The material is very thick and heavy.<br />The length is too much.<br />Inside skort is too tight and can not save and take the ball easily.<br /><br />Does not feel you can wear it for summer tennis. Winter indoors yes
3.0,"Love everything about this hat , other than the way the fabric wrinkles"
3.0,Love it but it ripped
3.0,Material was not what I expected. It's a soft t-shirt material. Fits as expected. The top sleeves have a thick gathering at the end like a scrunchie. The material for the both top and bottom is thick like a JC Penney tee. I was expecting a light almost see through type of material.
3.0,"Es un producto formidable, complicado de controlar y utilizar, por falta de informaci√≥n de configuraci√≥n del mismo, de all√≠ presta un servicio formidable y sustentado en calidad."
3.0,"Wasn't the quality I was expecting. No hard feeling's, it is pretty good."
3.0,The straw is a little itchy but it is big and protects your face from bright sun.
3.0,"Ok quality, and but I guess worth the price"
3.0,Not the same color as the picture. Picture is green dress is light blue.
3.0,Nice dress -very light weight material. Great colors & pattern. I had to return as it was to big. I bought a small.<br />Fast shipping and no problems with returns.
3.0,Beautiful dress but the lace seam is so flimsy it had a hole in it immediately
3.0,It‚Äôs good material but it was too tight for me.
3.0,Love it but button holes were sewn closed so I can't wear as a button up sleeve
3.0,"I tried ironing this shirt, & it stayed wrinkly...üòïüòí"
3.0,ok but way too small
3.0,This dress is a disappointment. It wrinkles easily. Out of the bag it is a mess. Be prepared to steam or press this before every use. That is assuming you can squeeze into it. It easily runs a size or two small. It is not a pretty shade unless you like cheap mustard yellow. Not cute like the picture.
3.0,"Super cute dress but did not fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù 100 lbs, petite. This dress was long on me and ran big. I got a small."
3.0,"These don't seem like real wool, but they are fairly warm. They're a little on the small side, but fit my child ok."
3.0,larger than expected. Usually wear a large but order XL because of reviews. arm holes are too large but I like the roomy fit. Going to keep but will order another in a smaller size.
3.0,"The idea is great ‚Äî to be able to size your own belt. However, the instructions could be more clear. They make it seem as if the buckle is already on the belt, but mine came separate.<br /><br />My belt is useless now because I inserted the strap into the buckle before trimming it. It‚Äôs almost impossible to take it out now. It seems like a great belt, but until the instructions are more clear I give it 3 stars."
3.0,Although I used size guidelines I wish I had gotten a larger size.  Felt snug through the middle and made the look less than appealing in an open front shirt combination.
3.0,I bought it for my mom and the neck hangs down really far. She won't be able to wear it without a shirt underneath
3.0,"The top portion of the hat doesn't sit like a normal hat. So, where the peace sign is, that area is pretty limp and faded back on your head. The hat feels ok, but, looks wise, i'm not a fan of the way it sits on your head. Also, the peace emblem is small."
3.0,Color off and runs very large
3.0,"After reading mixed reviews on sizing,  I decided to order my normal size. I can just barely fit into this costume! The top & cape are made of nice material but the skirt is thin & flimsy. After 1 wearing the threads attaching the skirt to the top began pulling apart. The arm holes are tight as well. I should have ordered a size larger."
3.0,Not easy to remove once on.
3.0,Its definitely magnetic but I‚Äôm not convinced of the therapeutic aspects. I wanted computers to break less around me... and I wanted less hip and shoulder pain. None of that seems to be better. I do have a fancier looking wrist though. I got the one with the black tourmaline and hematite on an adjustable band. Seems sturdier than elastic but the extra length dangles on my wrist. Also it seems to loosen on its own which I don‚Äôt think I love.
3.0,"Good product, but I wish it was less costly"
3.0,"I mean it looks great in the picture, looks great when you pull it out of its box but once you really look at it, I thought it was brushed metal but it's actually plastic, because of that they're virtually weightless. Still love these old school casio watches but this isn't my favourite, but you get what you paid for watch only cost me like 10 bucks, so I'm not mad I'll keep it as a spare and I love the 2 tone too"
3.0,I started out liking these but they have shrunk and now are hard to keep on my feet.
3.0,Not really black its more on the brown side
3.0,Cute but runs small. I have small hands and even the largest size was only big enough for my ring finger.
3.0,I loved the color but a size large fit everywhere except the chest area. Felt like I was being hugged.  I usually wear size M.
3.0,"The necklace is a bit itchy, but it looks good. The rock portion is not as sparkly/dimensional as in the picture."
3.0,My daughter liked these so I gave them to her.  They were very large for my liking.
3.0,This bag has a very nice quality but it is a lot wider than I expected. It's a great book bag but not small enough for me. However the shipping was pretty fast.
3.0,It's kinda small.  AWESOME quality but a little small.  And I have short hair
3.0,The touch screen does work. Thumbs very bulky.
3.0,I sizes up and still can‚Äôt wear this. I am large chested. In a regular tshirt I wear an XL. I got a 2xl and it is TIGHT.
3.0,This is a cute little tie clip but probably a choking hazard
3.0,You really cant see the wolf picture because the earrings are smaller than anticipated
3.0,The kids dress fit perfectly on my daughter. The adult dress not long enough.
3.0,Love the color and style of the dress but it‚Äôs really long.
3.0,"I love this outfit, the only complaint is that the pants material is a tad bit too thin but the top is of excellent quality. It is big for my daughter but she will eventually grow into it"
3.0,"I would rather spend more $ and get better quality, more stylish socks from Comrad. The seams were all wonky in these and they make my feet sweat a lot. I find myself shoving them to the back of the drawer often."
3.0,Nice earrings but the screws throw them off . Takes forever to take off
3.0,Adorable Ring!!  Black coating peeled off the first day I got it.  Instantly turned finger green.  Had to put clear polish on it to help.
3.0,"Over rated leggings that are comfortable but have zero compression, more fashion oriented and the two sizes really suck. I fall somewhere in the middle, so I got the larger and they are huge. They are also different fabrics and tones of black in the 3 pack, only 1 was really a black black. I gave it 3 stars because it is a good value if you aren‚Äôt looking for any support (feeling all tucked in and not jiggly) and are just wearing them around the house."
3.0,"Does the job. You can tell it's pretty cheaply made if you get up close, but it looks fine from the normal distance people would be looking at it. Only thing I don't like is that the grip is rather loose. May need to modify it a bit in order to alleviate that."
3.0,"Product would be fine except for the fact that the top and bottom pistons on the unit I received are out of alignment, which causes crystals to be set unevenly and could even cause one to break. Means you have to use smaller inserts in order to have the pistons fit inside the watch case as well. I assume my unit is defective, but would have hoped QC would catch something like this. Otherwise it‚Äôs a good value and quite sturdy."
3.0,"From the other reviews, it‚Äôs like I received a completely different sweater. It was thick and not oversized at all. It fit but not even close to the picture so I was very disappointed. The colors were accurate and the pattern on the front and back was the same but that‚Äôs where the similarities ended."
3.0,They look like they‚Äôd be nice for someone with an average or larger bust size but if you‚Äôre an A cup don‚Äôt bother. Small was still way too big (I‚Äôm a 34A).
3.0,they were perfect when I got them but I ended up having to take the hem out because they keep getting shorter.
3.0,"Arrived quickly and in good condition.  These seem like good quality shirt stays.  My issue is the length.  I am about 5'6&#34;, and these are not short people friendly.  I like shirt stays to be tight, and even tightened all the way, there is a lot of slack in them.  If you are wearing this with a dress shirt or something like that, it will do it's job, which is to keep your shirt tucked in.  But if you are wearing this with a uniform such as a military/law enforcement uniform, and you require the shirt to be tightly tucked at all times, and you are a shorter person, I would maybe recommend another product.  I'm sure it will be great for taller people.  As for the durability, I would say it is good to go.  Thanks."
3.0,"The top is made of nice breathable fabric, but the armholes are huge. I normally wear a 12-14 in a top and wanted a roomy fit for exercising, so I ordered an XL. It was very large, with huge armholes, so I returned it and ordered a large. The body of the shirt fit better, but the armholes were still enormous, revealing the entire side of my bra when I even slightly lifted my arms. I returned the shirt."
3.0,"Its beautiful, fits smaller then expected."
3.0,It's a really cute hat.
3.0,"I found it was a comfortable fit around the belly, but the shoulders are huge I need 4 more inches in shoulder height."
3.0,"So this was super cute, however it had an awful smell. I tried washing twice and it did not help at all. I had to return. They return process was super easy though so that was good :-)"
3.0,Nice fabric blend
3.0,One of the three shirts has already ripped.
3.0,"Pretty but the stones are too big and heavy,  especially the necklace."
3.0,"Why I bought it:<br />- I was looking for a sexy back swim suit with hipster bottom<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />- Fitting was not true to size and was a bit tight<br />- Bottom's edges really hurt the the V-area<br />- Top didn't cover entire bosom area (not cool for busty girls)<br />- Removable cups were not of good quality and smaller in size<br />- Quality of fabric was okay<br />- Packaging was pathetic<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />- Colors were bright<br />- Fabric glossed a bit<br />- Back string pattern was good<br /><br />Will I recommend it:<br />- I returned it, but if you are okay with the fabric then you may try it"
3.0,Looks great! Doesn't keep time well though. Off by an hour after a couple of days
3.0,"Have an elegant look but is much smaller than expected, not enough pockets."
3.0,"Awkward fitting, sizes run small so I ordered 2 up but the cut must be off. I guess that's why it was cheap."
3.0,tight for medium fit
3.0,The frame is too wide for my 6 year old. Fits me (adult) perfectly. Good for costumes though.
3.0,"I have a 7 3/4 inch head and hatsize, and have two other XL helmets that fit perfectly. But this Core helmet in XL did not fit at all. Much too tight, and wouldn't rest properly on the top of my head. However, the quality of this helmet appears to be excellent, and the paint is flawless."
3.0,I saw that the sizes ran small so I ended up ordering an XXL the bottoms fit fine but the top was a little small. Which probably wasn't the suits fault be used I have a 36DDD chest so I didn't really expect it to fit. Overall I'm happy with it though.
3.0,"I recommend going one size up. The fit is very small! It was not a particularly comfortable wear, and I was very happy to take it off. The fabric lacks stretch, and it's not particularly breathable. But it does look shiny and metallic"
3.0,It's very large on me and didn't have the fit and flare gather like it does in the picture. But it's very fun and the colors are great! Good for a beach coverup or something like that.
3.0,"I read all the reviews so I went ahead and ordered a large instead of a medium. It is still entirely too small. Make sure you order two sizes larger than what you would normally get. I also expected it to be more of a sweater but it‚Äôs rather thin. Besides the size, the shirt is very nice. The alien is an actual patch and over all it‚Äôs very cute."
3.0,"This was a good deal.  However, listing them as 18g, is a bit incorrect.  they kept falling out, and measuring them on my piercing gauge, they are a bit under that size."
3.0,"After reading other reviews of bracelets by this company, I expected the product to be of higher quality. The item I received seemed cheaply made and the leather was distorted from being bent in the box for so long. For the price though, I suppose I should have expected this. I still gave the bracelet as a gift as I'd originally intended since it wasn't worth the trouble of returning."
3.0,"I like the look on the upper, and I love the leather interior.  My only concern is that they may not stretch into my foot shape.  Brand new, they are a little snug for a size 8.  My heel is over the back edge when I first put them on.  Love the look tho.  I'll wear them, just not for a long walk."
3.0,"Nice hat, but too big and had to return"
3.0,"This is a great concept.  However, as other reviewers have stated, they are tiny and extremely fragile.  The  problem: If you get so much as a little tear in it, metal is exposed, and you are right back where you started.  I have ultra-sensitive ears and was very hopeful that these would help me.  However, I am glad they are working so well for others."
3.0,"I like the feel of it soft, but it wasn't what I thought it would be.  Also too short"
3.0,"I didn't realize it at the time but these are really light colored ties.  I like a little more darker colors in my ties.  For the amount of money charged, they are worth it."
3.0,This shirt fit a bit smaller than expected and some of the stitching at the seams is unraveling. It is super cute though and looks just like the picture.
3.0,Don‚Äôt put in dryer shrinks a full size!!!
3.0,Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. The straps are weird and the fabric isn‚Äôt comfy. Sent back.
3.0,These shoes are so cute and stylish for a toddler. They look great with jeans and slacks. However the shoe strings are a trip! I would‚Äôve given them a 5 star rating if they had Velcro straps. The shoe strings wouldn‚Äôt stayed tied so you had to tie them in a knot which then made them a pain to get off and on.
3.0,These slacks fit like the are a size larger than what I ordered.  Should have kept my old slacks as these are just as baggy my old ones!!  The tag said one size but the fit feels like they are a size larger.
3.0,"Sorry, had to return it because it fit too snugly around my middle."
3.0,"I don't know if it's just me or what. This belt is beautiful and nicely made, but is too short for the size I ordered. It goes around my waist all right, but the elastic twists while I'm wearing it and causes the fabric to bunch on the sides. I think I'm sticking to wider belts in this design, which is a shame. Maybe it will work better if you are slender and not an hourglass figure.<br /><br />I'm keeping this belt because it works nicely keeping a peice of luggage together."
3.0,"It is slightly thin, be ready to accompany it with another long sleeve shirt underneath in freezing temperatures.  Besides that, it serves it purpose greatly."
3.0,"The mask came a bit squished and was missing some pieces that go on the back. Other wise, this is what I was expecting and was very excited to get it!"
3.0,It is made of cheap material and would wrinkle easy.
3.0,"One of the belt loops broke instantly, the pants fit pretty well, but you‚Äôll sweat a lot if you wear them in the heat."
3.0,Very cute. Runs big. Thick material. Doesn‚Äôt wrinkle.
3.0,"Cute shoes, but too loose around the ankle."
3.0,Larger than I expected. I wish the straps were stretchy to allow for a smaller way to close the lunch bag than using the zipper.
3.0,"Runs big, I'm not a fan of the material. Looks cheap."
3.0,I like the product. The only issue is the numbers are a little small. This will help my niece tell time
3.0,"Bought for workout, feel is okay it‚Äôs definitely not a thick material and it‚Äôs see through which is fine BUT 100% runs small normally wear lg-xl but when ordering from here I‚Äôve learned to go up, good thing because the 3xl fits like an xl. It‚Äôs decent."
3.0,I love the shorts and the little over shall however if you‚Äôre a thicker girl like myself or have any kind of chub insecurities I recommend tossing the white top. I tried it on and it was like a sports bra. I have DD boobs and some chub so it definitely isn‚Äôt a flattering top
3.0,"Love Keens. I would buy Keen shoes for my sons any day, and we have quite the selection. So when we saw this boot we had to buy it. We did! We love it! But the top part of the boot was challenging to get on. We thought it was just a first time issue and would go away with time but nope, it‚Äôs always a struggle to get my kids foot in. If he didn‚Äôt love it so much we would have returned the boots but it‚Äôs staying for now. I wish Keen made boots as well as they make their water shoes for toddlers. I would love for the fit to come with a wide option in the calf part."
3.0,"It does float.  I tested that.  I also really like the Hawaiian pattern.  But the picture example looks like this strap will fit wide ear-piece sunglasses, but mine did not.  I had to unstitch it and restitch it so it would fit my Ray Bans ear pieces.  It still barely fit but it wasn't worth returning."
3.0,These are great jeans only if they fit.  I normally wear a size 6. Following the size chart a 28 would fit.  I assumed incorrectly that the size 28 referred to the waist size.  According to the seller that isn't correct.  I don't understand why a size would be labeled 28 and not actually refer to the size.  I am leaving this review to stop anyone else from thinking the same thing since this isn't in the description.  I measured the size 28 and the waist is actually a 33&#34; inch waist.  If that works for your needs I would recommend these as they are exactly as pictured and a nice quality especially for the price.  I only wish the size chart and description would have been accurate as that would have saved me time in finding something that fit me correctly.
3.0,"I received my Sterling jacket just in time for my trip to Maui.  I ordered up one size from a medium to a large based on reviews.  I really should have ordered up two sizes an extra large.  The jacket fits very well empty, but when you put even the basic essentials, (mini iPad, thin wallet, ear buds, charging cord, eyeglasses, a pen, and a granola bar), in the pockets, it becomes very hard to zip up and wear comfortably.  Unzipped, the jacket has a problem distributing the weight evenly.  I found that my neck became quite sore. I don‚Äôt know how other people put even more in their jackets and wear them comfortably while seated on the airplane.  The warmth was perfect for the plane. I would recommend this to a friend, and have, but the sizing is way off."
3.0,"To Whom It Concerns...<br />The following review is being written by my 12 year old daughter who is the recipient of this product.<br /><br />I really like how the product muffles background noise just like it is supposed to. However, when someone speaks directly to you, the headphones do a poor job of blocking the voice and makes it hard to understand. I also liked how they were adjustable, but they‚Äôre not so easy to adjust, and while it said it can fit from children to adults, the product is really only good for children."
3.0,"It's a nice bracelet, but nothing to write home about."
3.0,"Very nice watch for the money. The packaging was nice. The watch is placed in a nice orange box with a mini pillow inside it. came with instructions which I only use for the time and more of an accessory than anything else. It also came with the tool to pop out the pins in the wristband.. My only advice is use the same pin you popped out on the clamp. after removing pin from clamp to make adjustment to wristband size. I tried to use the wristband pin. and for whatever reason that pin from the wristband link would not go through the clamp. so I grabbed the clamp pin I popped out at the beginning of the adjustment. and poof! easy peasy.  This watch is also comfortable. Some watches like these are heavy and snag my arm hairs  My Only Beef and why I Bumped from 5 to 3 stars. The Clasp keeps popping lose. I've become an expert at closing again. But I'd rather not. Ex. while dancing or just rocking out to a band the clasp would come loose and I had to re-snap it, taking my coat off. Also it's ready for a battery refure to purchase date and comment date."
3.0,Not as thick or as warm as previous order of these socks.
3.0,I ordered an XL and received a 1X. For me 1X are ALWAYS too big!! Though super soft and cute I returned.
3.0,"Cute. But definitely runs small. Boughtsize medium for my 13 year old daughter, 5'7"" usually wears size 4-6. The top button is popping a little, will have to pin it. But she's only using this as part of a Halloween costume so we'll make it work :)"
3.0,"I bought these prior to a knee replacement so I could easily put socks over my wide feet post-surgery. To that end, they were fine. However the fabric was quite flimsy. One sock actually wore through at the heel after three days of wearing. I also bought some Wigwam socks that are made in extra-wide (wish I had found them before I ordered these) that fit just as well and stand up to the daily rigors of walking. Apparently these &#34;Big & Talls&#34; are meant to be worn but not walked on. Very disappointed."
3.0,Got to lose a few more pounds.
3.0,"Kid loves it gave it a 3 because i am sure it will snap if you keep bending to readjust the size,  as is quick delivery made the kid smile"
3.0,Plastic earrings that fall apart after a few months.
3.0,"Such a cute top, but too low cut.  I either keep pushing it back on the shoulders, or have to wear a cammi.  Husband thought it was alright though. Lol."
3.0,Did not look very  nice on. Just not right style for me.
3.0,"Definetly not 3x size, very small"
3.0,"Ok. It is a nice dress. However ...the zipper!!!! It's so fragile and gets stuck. I haven't being able to wear this cute dress because of the darn cheap zipper. But other than that, I would have given a 5 star. I have to send it to my tailor so she can change the zipper. :-/ because it is a super cute dress. :-)"
3.0,It was my husbands team and to honor him I wear it on my Pandora bracelet. That is for him.
3.0,Wish I got them in white like the image I selected
3.0,"Beautiful and soft. Still had difficulty sliding off my head, but I always have trouble with that!"
3.0,Its very cute but impossible to put in your daith on your own.
3.0,Unusual fabric - it's crunchy and stiff - will wash it but a little worried about how that will turn out.
3.0,"Pants felt like two sizes too small. I wanted to love it, but unfortunately had to return."
3.0,They run incredibly small and I ended up giving them to my teen. The quality is good though.
3.0,My daughter is a 4.5 so I ordered a 5 and it fits snugged.... but it's super cute.
3.0,"I like this top, but it's not what you expect. the model in the picture must be about 5 foot and 80 lbs. It is cute and I have found a nice way to wear it, but it looks nothing like the picture."
3.0,"Pro:<br />Looks like the pic.<br /><br />Con:<br />NOT 2mm wide.<br />13mm overall diameter, internal diameter is maybe 10mm<br />Small for guys."
3.0,The model is nice but the hour hand doesn't work well. It is nor according to the minute hand. I calculate the hour only with the minute hand.
3.0,Fits good but came rolled up in a ball and is very wrinkled which after washing and ironing I got most out.
3.0,They are warm and they fit.  After a few uses the one zipper came undone.  If I can fix it - we‚Äôll be back to 5 stars.
3.0,Soooo I don't exactly care for it. My little girl likes it. First off I was okay with the stars but it also has mooms incorporated into the fabric.<br />There is a streak in rhe back that seems to be missing the decorations<br />The fact that it's corset is helpful and we could've downsized because of it. Also the dramatic length is nice as well.<br />I still want to send it back.<br />We're holding it until the last minute in case I find her something better
3.0,I gave mine to my granddaughter.  They are for small feet.  They are cute though
3.0,"Too stretch on the ankle part, it seems it was made for a little girl."
3.0,"Kept them but not the color shown beautiful in black as well, does break easily"
3.0,"I purchased the 2 pack (black & blue) in a US XL. I ordered a size larger like I usually do when ordering from the internet. The leggings I received are very soft granted, but as soon as you wash them and wear them for the first time (of course, gentle wash & hang to dry), they are See-Thru.<br />I am not pleased that they make me self conscious."
3.0,I guess it's motivation to lose weight.
3.0,"It‚Äôs more black and white then charcoal grey. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be totally spandex material, but other than that it‚Äôs cute!"
3.0,"For my wife on VD. Hey, where is  the Velvet Pouch? :(("
3.0,I am 4' 11 and I ordered a large it fits but it a little long so I could not wear it :(
3.0,Very cute. Very thin too small for nose I think
3.0,Good size but it makes me look pregnant
3.0,It's too tight on arms & in stomach area
3.0,We love these boots only thing is the First day my daughter wore them the black line  around the bottom of the boots started coming off.
3.0,"I was not in pressed  with this purchase.  The overall fit was nothing like pictured.  The sewing  was uneven and puckered.  I fixed the mistakes and will not purchase anything from there again.  And another thing .....I ordered for a Christmas gift, and didn't receive until February. I could have sewed this myself."
3.0,"It does it really look like the picture. I will wear it for around the house shoveling, but it basically has no cut or tailoring to it at all. Looks like a bag with arms and legs that you then put a belt on. I would not order again, but I‚Äôm not bothering to send it back."
3.0,too heavy for daily wear.
3.0,"The cuff for top ear cartlidge is too thin stretching it over cartridge, I broke the metal piece off first time I put them on. Pretty though, cheap and arrived when it was suppose to."
3.0,I got a 2x and it's pretty tight! I was actually worried I ordered too large. I usually am a size large/xl.
3.0,Masks are nice looking but way to large.  Will not stay on my face.
3.0,"little wide around the sides fitting too loose on myself, but definitely shade your eyes from the sun if you wear presciption glasses"
3.0,"Would be really cute, but if you have muscular legs I would reconsider."
3.0,"Very cute, perfect size, just the right amount of compartments on the inside.....<br /><br />Problem is, less than a month of having it, the zipper is malfunctioning and falling apart... not the end of the world, but I have had stuff stolen out of my purses in the past when I‚Äôve had the same issue with zippers on a purse"
3.0,The brim of the hat is not even two inches.  I was hoping to embroider the chef‚Äôs names but there is not enough room.  The hats also do not stand up but lay more like a beret.  I would not have ordered if I had know this.<br /><br />The aprons are fine
3.0,I am petite and would have preferred more form fitting however I crisscrossed the straps to ensure the fit. Better than most aprons. Strength and durability for sure.
3.0,Fit fine but arm hole to large. Feels baby under arm.
3.0,"Worked good, but made for round profile. Not the straw hat profile.  Could be better if shaped properly"
3.0,Love the fit only thing is when I got it had a funny smell i washed it smell went away you can still smell it a little  Other then That perfectüëåüèæ
3.0,The leopard print itself is cute but the material is pretty cheap. I wanted my sweater to be a little fitted and as I was putting it on you could feel and hear the material ‚Äúbreaking.‚Äù The sweater fits just fine and it wasn‚Äôt exactly like I was struggling to get it on. You would think I was trying to squeeze into it. I gave it 3 stars because it is cute but I know it won‚Äôt last a lifetime.
3.0,"A way too-high waistline kept this dress from getting a 4 or 5 star review. Even in the seller's photo, the model has the separate tie belt sitting an inch or more below the waist seam - fact that is blurred by editing out the belt loops..Otherwise it is nice for the price."
3.0,"I suggest ordering a size smaller than you think.  I am 5'5, 135lb. I ordered large and it is huge in the waist, hips,  front and back. Don't dry them because the length will shrink."
3.0,"I had to order up for the sleeves to fit properly.  I wear a L, had to return for an XL so I could lift my arms up."
3.0,"I love this bodysuit but the only thing is that the material looks stretchier than it actually is. So I would size up, but overall very comfortable and cute."
3.0,Looks great and material feels nice too but the Medium was more of a Small
3.0,These sunglasses are pretty small. The bamboo arms barely touched my ears. They fit my wife's head pretty well though. Dudes with large heads beware!
3.0,"It is not one size fit all mask... Runs really small so you might have to slit it with a knife to make it bigger so it doesn't suffocate your face. The quality of the mask is rubber like hard but the designs on there are nice. I got countless compliment although I suffered wearing it for several hours.... Left rubber marks and redness for hour slight itching... But next day I was fine...therefore, don't plan on wearing it more than an hour without it bothering you."
3.0,It's ok for the price.
3.0,Cheap from China but ok
3.0,They get a bit short after they are dried. any taller than 5'1&#34; they would be short.
3.0,I don't like the style of the tissue.
3.0,It's cheap materials and not very durable but it's comfortable and lite
3.0,Beaeaeaea  bv io bsajjzs
3.0,"I thought this would be a nice soft mint color like it appears in the photo, but it is not. It is a very saturated mint green verging on gaudy in my opinion. Also, it was huge!! Much larger than I anticipated. Not exactly what I was looking for, but I have a few things to wear it with that it looks alright."
3.0,Look really nice but very poorly made. They've already lost a screw in the lens and in the arm.
3.0,"Nice fabric however, it runs a bit small"
3.0,"It had an odd plastic smell.  It was noticeable all day.  Very cute on, lots of compliments, just not thrilled with the smell."
3.0,"Look and feel is great - very monstery - but I couldn't get mine to stay in place. May work better for people with longer hair, or if you are just standing still and not moving or dancing or doing monstery things. The adhesive at the base of the horns where they attach to the felt pad and headband was also a little loose (Either there wasnt enough adhesive or they didn't apply it correctly, so it felt like the horns could fall off the headband very easily. I wound up tearing the horns off the band entirely and mounting them on another mask, and now I feel like if that was what I was going to need to do from the beginning to make these work I probably wouldn't have bought them at all. A friend of mine bought several of them for a party and noticed the same problem. So yeah, they look and feel great, but the construction not so great."
3.0,I bought this hoodie for casual wear in the autumn. It should work well as it is comfy and warm. I am slightly concerned about the seams around the cuffs. There were a few loose threads right out of the box. Hopefully they won't fall apart with future washes. Time will tell.
3.0,Works and is comfortable. However was very difficult to remove ended up snapping the earpiece on my glasses in half. Best to leave it on a spare pair.
3.0,Very supportive.  Not super comfortable!
3.0,"Thin fabric, not what I expected. I had to return it"
3.0,"This was a really cute dress. The material was not stretchy, unfortunately, I had to return it because it was too tight around my bust (40DD)."
3.0,Maybe I didn‚Äôt understand it was a belly shirt. Cute and the shorts fit but the shirt flares out and her stomach shows. Isn‚Äôt cute or comfortable. If it‚Äôs windy her chest can show. Lol
3.0,Came as time as described description as described. Decent quality
3.0,These run small.  They were very good quality but a small fit.
3.0,"Looks cheaply made. I turned it into a comfortable house gown. Also,  it's True to size."
3.0,Seams are a little skippy. there are thread of fabric loose from the seams. I expect to have to repair them to keep them from fraying.
3.0,This jacket is cute. I bought a large and I am 5' 7&#34; and 130 lbs. The elastic on the bottom is super tight and the jacket just fits me. Do NOT follow the seller recommendation of ordering your usual size. Get a larger size than you usually wear and expect very tight elastic on the bottom leaving an indentation in your upper hip.
3.0,"Nice colors, bright, wish I had ordered the aqua, material has a good feel."
3.0,"It's a very cute top, stylish and revealing in a tasteful way.  However, I feel that the quality of the material is very, very low.  I usually wash new clothing before I wear it but I'm afraid that if I do that with this one, I might never get to wear it.  The checkered top is literally just cut out of the material, leaving raw edges that seem prone to fraying.  The material is also very thin.  When I get a chance to wear it, I am hoping that it surpasses my initial impression.  If not, then I guess $9 is not too much for a disposable shirt."
3.0,I ordered  the tights  for my daughter  they run big and too long ehh...
3.0,"A limitted color of robes in that make, i need a size xl.  I hope to return item and get a replacement.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Gary Souders"
3.0,"I bought this as a gift and was disappointed when it arrived.  I don't know much about jewelry and weights, etc., but I expected something heavier for the price.  It looks nice, but REALLY light when you hold it... I prefer the heavier gold.  Not worth the price if I had to do it again."
3.0,The dress is beautiful!<br />The sleeves & back are too small though.
3.0,Looks different; but it is nice shirt and breezy thin for summer.
3.0,"This appears to be a pretty pendant, but I can not see the silhouette of Jesus. I had my hubby look at it and he aggrees. I wish there was a way to contact the company and ask. If anyone see its let me know!:)"
3.0,"a bit too tight and extremely difficult to get on.  If you have limited knee flexibility and big calves,  don't by this one"
3.0,Good quality just fit small even though I went a size up.
3.0,This was a cute shirt for the price.  However it did not hang well over my size DD chest so they went back unfortunately.
3.0,"quick shipping, stiff glove."
3.0,The hardware on the back of bre is rough.
3.0,It stretches out every time i put it on
3.0,smaller bags worthless
3.0,Just received a  few weeks ago. I have not had an opportunity  to wear them on but on one hunt but they were very comfortable out of the box.  I will write back with an extended review  you once I've worn  them a little longer.
3.0,"This dress is well made and all, but the fabric is much too stiff for this style. It wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. It looks drapey and flowy in the pic but it looks stiff on. It is made of a thick polyester with very slight stretch. I have ordered several AXParis dresses and they are all very well made but getting the fit right has been very difficult for me. I seem to be in between sizes. The size 6 items I order are a little too tight but the size 8 items are too loose. I guess I will stick to size 6 in this brand and plan in hopes of loosing 5 lbs to fit just right. That‚Äôs  better than buying size 8 and gaining 5 lbs to make it fit better. Lol Their clothes are made to be fitted. So be aware, there seems to be quite a big gap between size 6 and 8. For reference I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù 125 lbs, and I usually wear a size 4 or 6 in other brands. These are sized more like juniors. My measurements are 32DD chest, 26- 27‚Äù waist, and 38‚Äù hips. I"
3.0,"Lovely booties, but a tad too narrow fory feet.  Had to return.  The wait time for delivery was too long and the return was a headache."
3.0,You'll be lucky if this bikini lasts an entire summer season. But cute; 12 yr old loves it
3.0,"The material was way to thin, its impossible to wear it over a shirt. The only way i can wear this is by wearing a tank top underneath. I love the colors thou."
3.0,Shrank dramatically after first wash. Now are a size too small. Wasn't worth the money to me.
3.0,"We ordered this ""pantsuit"" thinking that it'd be fun for my daughter to wear the pieces as separates. The reality is that this is not a pantsuit; it's pajamas. The satin panel down the front of the top makes it look like full-blown pj's. They fabric is very, VERY stretchy. My daughter is 5'6"" and we ordered a Medium. She usually wears a medium, sometimes a small, never a large. As you can see, the top is very oversized (as expected) and the sleeves are long. The pants are the perfect length for her and fit her butt so perfectly I couldn't post the pictures, but in the front, they have bunched up, extra folds of fabric. Awful. These are not pants that are well-made. Just a very odd fit overall and not what we expected. We'll be donating."
3.0,This product bleeds every time I use it. When wearing at night it bleeds onto the pillow whether my hair is wet or dry.
3.0,"Had to return this watch, because the band is too small for my wrist.  Would probably be okay for a child or petite woman, but not for a man."
3.0,"Nice patterns of Disney, but not fond of material. Would just slide all over the place."
3.0,The goggles look great with then on and under the water they are very clear. The only thing for which I gave a low review was that I used them about 5 times and then after the goggles fall when using them or most of the time now I try to put them on they always open. Seems like the nose area where the band attach to the goggles start wearing out. Is very frustrating and disappointed even when I was using a lot of caution and storing them on the case everytime after using them.
3.0,"Very cute, thick material.. I am usually a size medium dress size 6... it fit me like a XL around the waist so I will have to bring it to the tailor to get it took in. But overall cute dress, I would order a size down."
3.0,"Bigger than I thought they'd be, kinda bulky but still very pretty."
3.0,"Love everything, but after I washed it once per tag instructions it became see through. Even if I wear tan underwear you can see it."
3.0,I love the look but it's waaaaay smaller than it said and barely fits my neck
3.0,dont care for the material...It should of had a stretchy type material added as well...You can hear it tearing as you take it off
3.0,"I guess I was expecting cloth and leather tennis shoes like my old ones, but these are all leather. They are too big and are not conformable. I will be sending them back."
3.0,"I thought they would be comfortable, but they tire my toes after a few hours ... the padding is good, it's the toe strap that hurts after a while."
3.0,Esstive black women's shirt with stars.  This shirt is cute and comftorable.  It is on the larger size.  I recieved a size medium and I am 5'4 and a 34D and is was a looser fit not fitted at all. The stars are cute and medium sized and the shirt seems to be of decent quality.  The shirt did not shrink from being washed or dried in the dryer.  The black materiel is not see through and the material is of a medium weight. Overall cute shirt for wearing around the house or working out in.
3.0,I bought this item thinking it would be good to use for a tragus earring but the hoop was too large so it didn't turn out how I had hoped. Would be good for septum or helix piercings.
3.0,"Purchased based on description ""Size - 14 - 16 Yrs"", Wrong!  More like 8 - 10 Yrs.  I don't know about your teen but mine wears an Adult M/L.  Returned shirt.  Other than that my son loved the shirts design and was very disappointed I have to send it back."
3.0,Was disappointed. The hinge screws do not fit and are loose. Tried to tighten but only moved a turn and still where sticking out. Too bad they are so cute but not worth the return expence.
3.0,I bought an XL and it came as a US Medium. The XL fits at most a 28 inch waist.I suggest ordering 3 sizes larger. But is made really well out of really good material.
3.0,"I am 5'2 and 125 pounds, and I ordered a large and it is still kinda short on me even though its a large.  Good thing high waisted jeans exist!"
3.0,I ordered the XS and they fit more like a medium. The material is thin and extremely stretchy (which isn‚Äôt a bad thing)..... I just wish they were more ‚Äútrue to size.‚Äù
3.0,"Nice product, it's exactly what you see in the picture... I chose it because my GF likes dragonfly.<br />also recommended for little girls, fancy"
3.0,very small a little disappointed but gave to my sister whom liked the bigness of it
3.0,"Product looks nice, packed well but the title should read...LEG WARMERS FOR PETITE WOMEN ..... They are not well fitting for anyone else unless maybe a girl ...."
3.0,I like it but according to price it's expensive
3.0,"This looked so light and flowy in the pictures, and after reading the reviews, I thought it would be perfect for my upcoming cruise.  I'm 5'8&#34; and have a 36B chest size.  I ordered the medium and the dress hit me above the ankles and was SO tight in the chest area that I had to return it.  Everywhere else it fit perfectly, so I am afraid if I order the large that it will look like a tent on me.  I went ahead and returned the dress and will look for something else."
3.0,"LOVED THE QUALITY OF THE SWEATER, BUT WAS WAY TO SMALL.<br />WOULD HAVE ORDERED A LARGER SIZE BUT IT WAS THE LARGEST<br />OFFERED"
3.0,"It's very nice quality, bit it comes as 3 separate pieces. It is hard to take on and off and you have to reassemble it of you take it off and it falls apart."
3.0,"The fit is as expected, but the fabric is thinner than expected. I knew that it was a light fabric, but it‚Äôs see-through and very revealing. I bought these thinking‚Äîfrom the photo‚Äîthat they could be worn for work, but they will be around the house only pants."
3.0,I didn't realize this was a fitted shirt or I would have ordered a different size. Very pretty and good quality though.
3.0,"They are okay, but fit a bit oddly.  They're too thick and don't quite cover the heel.  The traction is also a bit sticky."
3.0,"While they are very comfortable, these only work for shoes that go past my mid foot.  I wish they still made the short ones that covered just over the big toe joint.  These will still show in most shoes if you have smaller feet.  They are good for mules, though, and provide good padding."
3.0,"For the price this dress cannot be beat. The material is thick and durable, though I have only worn it a couple of times and it has pilled in some areas. Also, the dress is slightly large. I would say if you are unsure order one size down, definitely do not order up unless your bottom is much larger."
3.0,The design is so cute but the fit is so off. It‚Äôs poorly tailored and big at all the most odd and least flattering areas. Using a belt and safety pins helped and I uploaded some pictures with them but it definitely feels like a potato sack if you wear it normal.
3.0,Cute but extremely short if you lift your arms up your boobs pop out so probably size up
3.0,The tie string is not long enough and one of them broke the first week I had it on
3.0,Its Nice Exept it Has mai kun on it ruins the belt buckle
3.0,I ordered a men's medium and I normally have a inch or 2 to spear on bottom seams but not on this one it kept riding up my hips . So when ordering go a size up but other than that great hoodie
3.0,"Cute, but doesn't fit well and the clasps are not very well made. For the price and a few wearings it is cute."
3.0,Material is very thick so I wouldn't call it lightweight but It is easier to breathe in this one than most thick masks.
3.0,"Very nice, however the straps were too short."
3.0,Very comfortable even though a little big.
3.0,much bigger than I thought it would be.
3.0,3 of the 4 were flawless the last had strings everywhere and the ear loop had been sliced rendering it useless.
3.0,I expected the cube to be larger for the price.
3.0,"This was supposed to be Little Boy sizing (4-7). It isn't. They are Big Boy's sizes (8-16). The best is ok, just not the size listed in the description, returning."
3.0,"It's not bad for the price. I bought it as part of a costume and it worked fine. The fabric is clingy and really stretchy. The color is as pictured (I got the dark green). I ordered small and it's kinda baggy, but that's how it's supposed to be I guess. My waist and hips are 26in and 35 in."
3.0,"The slipper looks great but it was too small even with following the sizing instructions. My husband wears size 10 1/2-11 and it was recommended to go up 1 size which we did and he could not get his whole foot in the slipper. Very sad as they look very nice and feel comfortable, just too small."
3.0,Pearls were smaller than expected.
3.0,They are smaller than I assumed and they don‚Äôt hang that well.
3.0,"The coat itself was fine and I would have given 5 stars, but the belt did not have any holes in the last 20 inches.  I had to purchase a tool kit to punch my own belt holes."
3.0,"Lightweight, but warm and cozy.  My cat loves it too!"
3.0,I ordered a woman‚Äôs size small and although the description says over sized this feels like a large in men‚Äôs. The jacket itself is warm and cozy inside but the 3 stars rating is because it‚Äôs huge. I‚Äôm normally a large in woman and it feels like it‚Äôs an extra large in woman‚Äôs. If I wanted this jacket to fit me decent I would have to order extra small in woman.
3.0,I love them they came back beautiful
3.0,The shirt doesn't look quite as in the image. The stitching looks cheap and wrinkled across the chest. Material is nice.
3.0,Cute but more of a dress / long tunic. I wear a L or XL most of the time and the medium I ordered for my daughter fit me perfectly.
3.0,Wrong Size
3.0,this bracelet is for a small wrist. The clasp does not hold well. It keeps coming undone.
3.0,"These are back up boots, not my everyday ones."
3.0,This dress is 2 sizes small I ordered an  XL it fits like a medium
3.0,Its a beautiful necklace but it came broken however I managed to fix it and can be worn but still wished if it had arrived in one piece.just can say order √†t own risk because it can come damaged.
3.0,"These are nice shorts but run too small.  I wear a 33 or 34 waist so ordered the 2XL as directed, and they are not wearable - too small..so sending back"
3.0,El material no es muy agradable al tacto.
3.0,"Ummmmm... This one is a NO for me. Its thin, cheesy and almost looks a little tarnished.. My 12yr old loves it...  Undecided if I will return or give it to my daughter..."
3.0,"It's beautiful, but it is a little bit bluer- it's definitely more of an aqua // teal<br />It fits great, but I like a looser fitting dress. I love the cut and will re-purchase in another color"
3.0,I thought the caps would be a silicone.  They are not.  They are a hard plastic which fits inside the K Cup.  So far I have plugged up my Keurig a couple times now because the coffee grounds go up inside the water spout.  I have not tried to use loose leaf tea yet.  Hope it goes better.
3.0,"cute, good length as it's just little above knee. However, the seams are very visible vertically (there are total 3 seams)."
3.0,The sleeves aren't quite the same as pictured.
3.0,I haven't got a chance to use this hoodie. I'm waiting for a very very cold night like New Years Eve. But after I wear it ill will def write a review. I've tried it out and had no problem breathing and felt very comfortable. I recommend this
3.0,"My waist is 27.5 inches and this was slightly loose. Bum area stretched out pretty thin but not terribly so. Wicked sweat alright as well. Not as good as our $100 leggings but decent for the price. I'm 5' and it definitely was full length for me, loose around ankles too."
3.0,Beautiful and bright. Looks just like the picture. The necklace is on the short side and better suited for a young teen or someone with slim build. I am giving the necklace and earrings to my daughter and I'm keeping the ring. Not bad for less than $8 dollars!
3.0,Cute dress just way too big. I weigh 145 lbs am 5'3. Normally wear a medium but ordered a small because people say it runs big. I ordered a small and it looks like a potato sack on me.
3.0,Positive : It's material is NOT see through<br />Negative : roughly sewed. Had to hem the neckline
3.0,"Love the belt; poor description regarding its length. The description says ‚Äúlong,‚Äù but it also says it fits ‚Äúup to‚Äù a 40-inch waist‚Äîthis would fit way larger than that. The packaging says it will fit up to 58 inches. I‚Äôm going to keep it, but I never had this description problem ordering directly from Arcade."
3.0,Normal üôÑ.
3.0,They are not this hot/fushia pink in person they are more like a bubblegum pink a little disappointed abt tht.
3.0,The watch band itself was absolutely beautiful and I love it so much. I wasn‚Äôt able to wear it long though. I am allergic to latex and after wearing this watch band for only an hour or two my wrist broke out in red itchy bumps and it went completely around my wrist just where the watch band was
3.0,Wear to work
3.0,"I like the lighter fabric, but was disappointed on how much it shrunk after getting washed."
3.0,"These wristwatch straps, because of the [many] adjustment holes will fit wrists from babies (literally) to my 8&#34; wrist, which I do using the fourth from last hole."
3.0,"Love price, appearance and fit, but a knob fell off during delivery and I'm not sure if I want to send it back for that reason or keep it and try to fix it myself? It took so,so long for delivery."
3.0,"This mask has nice construction and a good feel, but I can immediately see it getting very hot... Winter is coming after all so maybe that's a good thing for cold weather. But my issue is that it's HUGE on my face. There's way too much room in front of my face, beyond what's needed to breathe comfortably, it's awkward. And the coverage; It both covers my throat and touches my neck AND goes up so far on my face that it's in my vision."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this bathing suit, the pattern is so cute and the style looks great in the pictures. I ordered an XL (I wear a 34 bra band, M/L tops, 8/10 pants) and the bottoms fit great. The top seemed like a miniature version and the way it fell on my body was not flattering; the &#34;waist&#34; hit right under my boobs, and the little skirt completely covered up my natural waist and made me look wider (really don't need any help in that department, hah...). I'm not sure if I have an unnaturally long torso, or if the suit was just weird. Ended up returning :("
3.0,"super cute, good quality. but ordered a small and got a medium"
3.0,Nice bit slip off my butt a lot
3.0,nice ring it was ok
3.0,These are nice pants - very soft and pretty but they do NOT have a drawstring which is the whole reason I purchased these over the other options available. They look the same as another cheaper option which is frustrating.
3.0,I didn‚Äôt know that the masks weren‚Äôt satin/silk completely. Only the front side of the mask is the silk fabric. The backside/inside is a white linen/cotton that feels itchy on my face. I don‚Äôt really use these that often because they‚Äôre so thick they‚Äôre actually uncomfortable to breathe in.
3.0,I bought 2 of these. One came as a tshirt and not a sweatshirt.  So I was disappointed.  But my girls will like it.
3.0,This Belt is great and also good looking.  Here are somethings to watch out.  My waist size is 32&#34;. I bought a Medium.  But this Medium can fit a waist of about 38&#34;.  The belt is also like elastic. It stretches quite a bit. So be careful when you order to pick the right size
3.0,Runs small but goal pants are good
3.0,"Love this product. It exceeded my hopes.  The pockets are very well thought out, the fabric is great, the color is great.  Based on the product, I would give it 5 stars. However, when I ordered it, the order page gave me a receive by date of 12.27.16.  I needed to receive it by 12.27.16 as I was going out of town early the next day.  The item didn't arrive until I was already at my location. Highly disappointed.  This has happened several times with promised receive by dates."
3.0,I'm 5'7 167 lbs and I ordered an XL. The bottom fits a bit loose but not a big deal. I do think they need to make the tops bigger for people with bigger breast because it doesn't fit at all. The colors were way off but still a cute print. If you have large breast then you may want to reconsider. I wear a 36DD.
3.0,The bag is nice but I received the WRONG COLOR. Don't let the photo fool you! Mine came GOLD. NOT SILVER.
3.0,Effect on light was good but they are super uncomfortable.
3.0,The fabric is very sheer and rough.
3.0,They don't stay up and my feet are Cold. Very thin.
3.0,IT just didn't look quite right so I returned it
3.0,"I only gave it three stars due the fit. Quality however was good. Beautifully wrapped , soft leather and plush fur lining . For me however they have to fit like a second skin- And these were too boxy looking"
3.0,"The pattern of this dress is really nice. Only problem is that the material is see through so the overlapping pattern in the ‚Äúwrap‚Äù section shows through the top layer. I bought when I was very early in my pregnancy, didn‚Äôt get to wear. Will wear this coming spring season."
3.0,Love the color and style.  On me the large fit like an XL.  I want to exchange the large for a medium but I am only getting the option to return for a refund.  Who do I need to contact to exchange?  Thanks!
3.0,Maybe plated. Turned color quickly. Sounds like tin when flicked. My ears began to hurt when it began to turn.
3.0,"Order your regular size. Fabric is good, not too thin or clingy. I will purchase one in my size."
3.0,"I guess I should've read the description better; when it says &#34;frosted&#34; it means no shine. It's still nice, I plan on keeping it, but next time I'll read the description better."
3.0,"I bought these sunglasses because they were cheap and I could just keep in my car for driving or wear them when I'm going for a run. From the time I opened them I could see there was a problem. One of the &#34;arms&#34; is incredibly curved (see the picture; they're on the right) while the other is not. It makes these sunglasses a bit uncomfortable to wear. I wasn't expecting much from polarized sunglasses at this price, so I can't downgrade these sunglasses too much, but I would obviously prefer a symmetrical pair of sunglasses. That being said, the sunglasses do their job. They shield my eyes from the sun and the polarized lenses are very crisp."
3.0,"UPDATE: I had to take back two stars because the band broke in about a week. The elastic holding one of the rows of beads just started to fray, and then broke.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous watch band! It has a nice weight to it. Does not feel cheap at all. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it, but would not be an issue for most people, is that I have very large wrists for a woman (8‚Äù) and it‚Äôs a little bit tight, I think it would fit a 7-7.5‚Äù wrist perfectly. However, it‚Äôs so nice and pretty that I will suck it up to wear it. The pictures don‚Äôt even do it justice."
3.0,I like the dress but it‚Äôs a little thin.
3.0,Runs on the very small side...had to give it to my daughter who's 13... so yea it's small.
3.0,"this is a very large keychain, you won't loose your keys with this."
3.0,Nice fit on top but to long I‚Äôm 5‚Äù5‚Äù
3.0,"I love the color and design of this shirt, but it is waaaaaaaay too small. I ordered up several sizes and still too small."
3.0,"It's a little big in the hips. Fits well everywhere else and I like the length which is right at, or a little below, the knee for me (I'm a solid 5'4, almost 5'5). Also, I like that it is lined but the combination of the lining and the material, which is a thicker, courser knit (which alone is an unexpected, nice texture), makes this dress feel a bit bulky. Pretty maroon/crimson color."
3.0,Did the job but as I am usually a l/xl in shirts and pants and 5'5 the skirt was super tight and too short for my dress. If you petite and short it is definately worth it! Just not recomended for people my size or bigger :)
3.0,Need a larger ring 1 -1.5 inch
3.0,"It's OK but a bit gommy, I  was looking for a thin lightweight unit this is pretty big and thick leather . Good price and ,while not elegant it looks decently made."
3.0,Good quality. Wasnt large enough.
3.0,The fit was great but the color was a lot brighter than the advertisement.  But I still like it.
3.0,Size chart is inaccurate. Dress ran very small and returned for inaccurate sizing. Fabric was thick (that could be a pro or con) with interesting and pretty blue print. Disappointed in the fit.
3.0,Tight across the chest and shoulders. Very good quality fabric though!
3.0,"The shoes are cute however, in my case they were a half size too big. They don't look cheap and the platform is a little bigger than it looks in the picture. Will definitely be returning them and ordering a smaller pair."
3.0,"Sleeveless cardigan is not very made and quality of materials is very poor. For the cost, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Cute just runs really small
3.0,My only issue is ‚Äúred‚Äù is not red it‚Äôs more orange which I‚Äôm not happy about because that‚Äôs the main reason I bought them
3.0,"I bought this for a Citizen Ecodrive that has a canvas band. It does not fit out of the box. A little dremel work on the attachment points, and I was able to get it to work, but I wouldn't recommend it as a Citizen band replacement. Granted, they aren't advertising it as such either.<br /><br />The quality of the band seems ok. The machining was mostly good, but the attachment links are hollow and make for a cheap feel. I don't know if this is standard or not, but I did not care too much for the way that part of the band is made. The clasping mechanism seemed generally fine, although it did not rest as flush as I would have liked.<br /><br />I ended up putting the canvas strap back on my watch. If I feel the need to have a steel band, I'll probably look for a genuine Citizen band."
3.0,"The bracelet fell apart after wearing it once, the hat was cheaply constructed.  It wasn‚Äôt worth the time ir effort . Lesson learned . Probably made in a kids craft class."
3.0,Too small but cute. Go a size up.
3.0,It does not fit. It's too big and very hard to keep on her wrist. Not meant for a juvenile.
3.0,my clothes get caught between the face of watch and band.
3.0,Linked most of it but the lights don't work all these time and some of the stitching is wrong so the coat doesn't sit correctly
3.0,"I really liked the style & colors of this dress but, the reason why I sent it back was the arm holes were too big otherwise I would have definitely kept it. I really did like the pockets on the dress. Maybe I can try & order a large instead to see if it would fit better."
3.0,"Cute shirt. Nice material. Definitely order a size or two up. I generally wear a large or xl. I am 5'9&#34; and wear a size 12. I ordered a 2x and the pic is before it was washed so definitely hang dry. Wish it were a little looser. The top is loose, which is weird bc I am busty, but it's a little tight for me around my midsection. Definitely afraid to receive the xl shirt I ordered from China as well."
3.0,This to isn‚Äôt the same as the others - it doesn‚Äôt show side boob but.. it is a bit see through (not too bad) but runs small in the chest. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù 38B/C.
3.0,Good material but not long enough
3.0,"Way thinner than I thought it would be, fits too big on me sadly, and I will probably not be able to wear it with my other pieces. The laces dont go all the way down the back, ae too long in the front, and are very thin laces. I think others will be happy with this, but i am not."
3.0,"Pants were delivered quickly and material seemed very thin and cool, was definitely sheer but the length of the material between the legs was long. It was perfect leg length and sat perfect on the hips therefore pulling them up further on my abdomin would to fit the crotch would have made them to short and worn to high up. Maybe would be perfect for someone shorter that likes a higher abdominal wear!"
3.0,Looks fuller and larger in the photo. It is super tiny
3.0,It brroke the first week
3.0,"These are decent for the price. I originally bought these to wear because I liked the style and the color. When I first got them, I was still pretty excited to wear them, but after the first time, I began to not like them as much as I did. They wore down way too quickly and I only wore them a few times. Plus, they were a little difficult to snap on. If I had to go back I would definitely consider purchasing another accessory or from another brand."
3.0,This mask is not what I expected. It looked like it had sequence bit it doesn't. Just print to look like sequence. The mask is on the bigger side but I still like it. It does the job.
3.0,"Thought this was gonna be usable, turned out to be too big for any practical use. Now it's just another thing to look at."
3.0,Super cute and good quality but had a strong odor when it arrived.
3.0,Ordered XL but its for a tall person as the shirt length is really long. I wish its a regular length shirt. My husband doesnt love it for this reason. Im returning it.
3.0,Material is too thin. I expected some weight to the boxers. Hold up to the light and you can read through them.
3.0,"Shirt just wasn‚Äôt printed well or something because the 3D isn‚Äôt there. My son liked it so i kept it but was disappointed. The material is nice, soft and stretchy. Great length."
3.0,"They are really bad, just the sizes are off..  get a size up.. if you're a large go XL.."
3.0,3 stars because it rolls up under breast which is annoying and the straps cris-cross brakets ar put in wrong place towards front can't have it do that in front. Issues holding up/fully supporting big breast even heavier from milk.
3.0,"The dress is pretty, but it doesn't look fluffy and deep red like the picture and it was too large for my daughter. The top is absolutely gorgeous. I'm returning the dress."
3.0,This bracelet is cute but the quality is not that good. It is very thin and flimsy. The size was okay for an adult and it is adjustable. My only problem is that I don't know if it will last a long time considering that I have had dainty jewelry break in the past. For the price I was expecting a sturdier bracelet.
3.0,It's a little tight for a normal 3x shirt
3.0,"These are very thin material but they work for what I needed them for. Although I wouldn‚Äôt use these as replacements for paper masks, etc for Covid protection."
3.0,It didn't last long broke in a month.
3.0,"Looks like great sunglasses but not for my glasses, they won't fit. Mine have a bar that runs across the top of the bridge. These won't drop down far enough to cover the glasses. I'm sure my friend will appreciate the gift."
3.0,They fit tight they were somewhat small for me. However they did the job for our little party thanks.
3.0,"Needed better instruction, I think. I cut the excess too much on my daughter's high-tops, and now we can't really open the shoe enough to get her foot in."
3.0,Cheap but hey who wants to spend $200 on lenses and thin metal frames?<br /><br />it definitely helps with the sun while driving but i cant help but feel like another pair i used to have worked way better. there's also some glare on the inside of the lenses if the sun hits you just right.
3.0,"Based on the listing details and images I expected this to be more substantial.  It is a very thin chain and the bars are narrow and thin also. One of the chains bends easily and the two together get tangled up pretty easily.  It is a beautiful rose gold and is very pretty.  But, because it is so delicate it is not my style.  If you are looking for something delicate, this is perfect."
3.0,Adorable outfit but the seem around the elastic waistband came unraveled after the first time my daughter wore it. My grandmother was able to sew it back together but I'm sure it's just a matter if time before they come apart in another spot...the shirts are a very thin cheap feeling material.
3.0,No est√°n mal por el precio aunque algunos la borla est√° mal cortada
3.0,"The closure is not velcro as described, it is buttoned.  This color was true to size except the legs were a bit too slimmed.  The Khaki color was not true to size, about 2 sizes smaller although the label said the correct size."
3.0,Beads in elbow on one sleeve fell apart and rolled around like loose marbles
3.0,"Pedi size S seg√∫n las medidas q estaban en la tabla d sizes y no me qued√≥ el vestido , demasiado grande"
3.0,a little too tight around wrist.
3.0,Colors were not as described
3.0,The shoes were a little snug for their size but loosened up well after some play. The material is definitely thin and doesn‚Äôt inspire a lot of confidence. They‚Äôve lasted a winter of street futsal but I doubt they‚Äôll last a second.
3.0,"The bag is heavy duty, hardware has no problem and travel with my all the time. I have no doubt this back will last a very long time. Three stars due to the tanning of the leather making the die rub off on clothing and the cloth lining all around the edges frays all the time. This is not a Saddleback. It also does not have a Saddleback price."
3.0,"My husband is ruff on belts and these weren't any different. They work quite well, but the durability wasn't the best. I personally think it has to do with how tight he wore it, but it did keep his shirt tucked in."
3.0,"This is cute and fits ok, but the underwire is very uncomfortable, I may take it out"
3.0,The skirt on this dress hugs awkwardly.
3.0,"It's ok I guess ,the quality snot that great but it's pretty good for $10"
3.0,"I bought a large for my 10 yr old daughter and although she was in love with the shirt, it was a little tight.  I would say be cautious with selecting the size."
3.0,I ordered 2 pairs of these ears and the first pair came pretty quick. It was kind of tight on my head but not too bad. The ears were pretty close too. The second pair came a few days later and one of the ears was completely broken. Of course nothing I can't fix with a glue gun so it's not that bad.
3.0,It &#34;ok&#34; but I removed the other MF watches from my shopping cart after get this one. I had to return the unit after about 12 hours. One button broke.
3.0,Runs tight in arms material thin not washed yet hopefully won‚Äôt shrink okay shirt I guess for price you get what you pay for
3.0,"I am only 5'2 and these pants were very long. Even with a small heel they dragged a bit. They did not have a zipper or button so the were a bit harder to pull on, being that I have wider hips. I washed them and dried them once. They shrunk slightly but did make them a bit tighter which I prefer. They were incredibly loose from just above the knee, all the way down, before I dried them."
3.0,Good but<br />  The clips for the adjustable fit is easily  destroyed<br />  the back is short even the front is short<br />But it keeps me warm<br />Done the job<br />Overall MEH<br />Good
3.0,Advertised with iPhone Case and no iPhone Case came with order.
3.0,"I ordered a medium which worked out to be a good choice, I'm 5'3/4&#34; and weigh 136lb. It's pretty, I like the material and it fits nicely on my body. However it's slightly poorly made. My chest line is uneven.  You'll see the crooked pattern is in the picture I'm posting. That's going to adjatae me."
3.0,"It‚Äôs okay, not very soft or anything but it covers me up so that I can take the dog out. The black collects dog hair like crazy but it‚Äôs light enough that I can wear it outside in the florida heat"
3.0,"I washed it in cold and drip dried, yet this shrank 2‚Äù shorter.  Quite disappointed.  Otherwise a decent dress."
3.0,VERY TIGHT AROUND THE WRISTS HARD TO GET HANDS INTO. LIGHT DUTY NOT FOR REALLY COLD TEMPS
3.0,"The tights are a bit short than expected, and not very stretchy. If you get a size up, it should work out well."
3.0,"Wasn‚Äôt the width I expected, very thin."
3.0,Much smaller than I expected and a very very faint green color in the stone. For the money not bad I guess but was expecting a little better quality.
3.0,It would work better if the shoulder snaps went all the way down sleeve.  It had to be it to be used post rotator cuff surgery.  So I could have just used an old tshirt.
3.0,I ordered 2 pairs and one of them had about 10 small holes as if moths had got to them. They fit and feel nice on.
3.0,"Although a very cute and simple necklace, the 'J' hardly shows up and the chains feel very thin and cheap."
3.0,Had to return Way too small and too short
3.0,"I'm 5'6"" and the length on these were 3 -4 inches too long. Otherwise a nice fit"
3.0,Very disappointed at how cheap the fabric was
3.0,Order a size up if you can.  I am 5'7 200lbs and I ordered xxl and it's tight
3.0,It ripped bad.. the fabric isn't that strong fyi
3.0,"I bought these as a remedy for Plantar Fasciitis. I found them only remotely comfortable, especially for an arch and heal that was hurting. I could only wear them for a couple hours a day and have since settled on a different brand with a less pronounced arch support and softer to the bottom of my foot."
3.0,Super comfy but top is kind of small and pants are too long. I love them just wish they fit better
3.0,"Rather thin, but good enough for safety glasses at work."
3.0,This bag is so cute and I bought it to carry to the beach and pool over the summer and it held up great! The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because after the summer season the zipper have out and broke! :( I was super bummed because this bag was so cute and huge it held everything I needed and then some!!!!
3.0,Color was nothing g like pictured.  Disappointed about that.  Fit was fine.  Will keep but would have preferred true color.
3.0,"Disappointed in color- it really sucks. Wine color fades to a pale pink and I really hate pink. I cover it with a puffy vest. Lightweight, soft, comfortable, accurate sizing; otherwise, would have returned."
3.0,The bag is pretty
3.0,served its purpose but after heavy use  the leather came apart at the seams
3.0,It does not look good.
3.0,"Good value. Lots of loose strings, crooked seams, etc but I wasn‚Äôt outfitting the Navy; I was sticking hats on 5 year olds at a birthday party. Perfectly good for that."
3.0,The cup size is a little big but overall love the color and quality.
3.0,"I don't like seeing the glue on kids sneakers. Other than that, I like the style."
3.0,"Nice shirt, but I wish it was a little more fitting to the body."
3.0,"I am somewhat disappointed. I should probably just return them. Way too tight. In the photo, the flared look made me think it was loose. But its tight all around. Boo :-("
3.0,Tha back is not grey like the front-I may need to wear something under it so it's not showing my bra.
3.0,The earrings are pretty but they hurt my ears
3.0,"Returned for refund.  Product not for me, too clingy.  Material was too thin and slinky.  I felt like I was wearing a slip not a dress.  Not for me.  Great length though and color was as described."
3.0,Little loose but super cute
3.0,The cup size is true to size and very comfortable. The band size runs 1-2 sizes too small. I would side up. I love that it has clear straps.
3.0,"*Update..I am recanting my original review...They quickly grew on me.I like them.<br /><br />Unless I received a different model these glasses are NOT dark. These lenses are comparable to my plastic, neon yellow glasses I bought for $1...I uploaded a comparison. See for yourself.<br />The arms of the frames look different too.<br /><br />Anyway, I am debating on sending them back, because I was expecting ""Super Dark Lenses"" for sunny day driving."
3.0,"Nice product, I like em. Just didn't receive the size I ordered"
3.0,I mean they kinda hurt and do not stay on
3.0,"purchased with discount , but this is not 8MM, its about 5 mm<br /><br />quality is ok but shouldnt say 8MM"
3.0,"Stiff, stitching nothing like the photo and overall just kinds cheap looking.."
3.0,"Stitching looks great, perfect fit. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the smell is HORRIBLE."
3.0,"Not as I expected. Super thin, thought it was a sweat shirt."
3.0,Horrible knot in the delicate chain upon receiving this necklace. It is small but very pretty. I would have given 5 stars if it didn't take me 2 hours to undo the knots... lmoat sent it back because of being so frustrated. This company should change the way they ship to prevent knotting of the chain.
3.0,"The hoodie fits well, the sizing is accurate. The design on the sweat shirt is different in person. In the stock image, the flag is more defined. On the item itself the eagle is more dominate than the flag. The eagle is on both sides of the hoodie. The blue is dark... almost black. Overall it's cool and it's still nice."
3.0,"Used as a gift. Don't know if it they fit.<br />Poor quality,  very thin material."
3.0,"I went by a few other reviews when ordering my size for this dress; I ordered the small. I am 5'6, 135 pounds, size 4-ish in dresses and I think my measurements are something like 34/29/35 (34C bra) (Im boxy). The small fits just fine...it just wasn't all that flattering, but if I had gone up a size, the top would have been too big. I think the dress would work better for someone with a bigger chest, but it just didn't suit my figure at all. I did receive a discount to review this product, but I also actually paid for it. And tried it on. And was sad about my lack of curves! haha! (I'd post a picture but...I don't really want anyone to see me in it.)"
3.0,"I figured I‚Äôd get a pair of these sunglasses since I lost my last pair.<br /><br />Based on the the reviews I have seen, it seemed like the glasses were big. So i figured I‚Äôd order them because I have very wide temples.<br />As I received them, they were the complete opposite. The lenses were tiny and the arms of the glasses were too close to each other, which squeezed the temples of my head.<br />They were nice and were great quality, but they weren‚Äôt the ones for me.<br /><br />Giving them a 3 stars cause they‚Äôre nice, but they only good for small-headed people.<br /><br />If they make bigger ones, I will definitely get another pair."
3.0,Love it but they didn‚Äôt send me the shirt that pictured
3.0,It simply too short
3.0,I love it but it has a small hole in the front.
3.0,Cute but long on me
3.0,These are super short! They are so soft and comfy and would make the greatest chill pants but the length just does not work for me (I am 5‚Äô5). Also the thigh had something embroidered on it ‚ÄúD studio‚Äù which I didn‚Äôt notice in the picture. Also the color is bids and would look perfect with a white tee.
3.0,"I wish this would have fit better, because I loved the gold color, and light weight thin velour, it's not heavy at all. However the top was like a crop top, not a good look for me, runs very small and short unfortunately for me."
3.0,"It just looks different from the cute picture.  It is not too sheer, which is a good thing.  For me, it is the length of the blouse.  I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù and this blouse is just too long for my taste.  The length somehow looks like a design mistake.  Overall, it is not horrible but I think I am going to spend my money on something else."
3.0,"Gorgeous dress, got rave reviews at the wedding, but my toddler kept pulling off the pearls all night. She's smart enough to not eat them when she's told not to, but she definitely tried. But after one wearing the dress is a bit ruined because she pulled off the pearls. Would've been nice if they could be worn again."
3.0,"okay product if you like wearing flat shoes, I put extra padding inside so I could wear them longer."
3.0,not readly
3.0,As sexy as the dress fit it was a bright purple leaning towards more pink/purple. I wasn‚Äôt that big of a fan because I was expecting a darker purple
3.0,Love the shape- however it was a bit small around the nose other than that I was pleased with my order
3.0,Overall I am happy with this bag as it is a good size and holds all of my soccer referee gear for game days. I am concerned with the durability as I have had the bag for a couple of months and the seam by one of the side straps and one of the bottom corners of the main compartment has separated and needed to be repaired. I sewed it with extra strong thread and it seems to be holding up but I would not have expected to need to repair it so soon after purchase.
3.0,I order a large. It bearly fits. Most of the large flannel shirts I have are a bit too big for me. Not a happy as I could be with this purchase.
3.0,Loved how they slip on like socks. Dislike that they dont give much support. After an hour or two of walking through the water park both my kids complained that their feet hurt. Also they do absorb a good amount of water but they do dry quickly. For the price very effective
3.0,Got these for my sisters special needs class and they came to late to use foe her Christmas party so don‚Äôt know how well the work. Maybe she will be able to use them in the future
3.0,It tends to want to ride up on my daughter. I wish there were snap buttons by the diaper area too. It is a pretty material though I will say. Sparkly and dazzling!
3.0,"My daughter wanted some wheeled shoes and thought these looked fun with the lights. However, I think the lights frustrate her more than anything! One of the shoes seems to have a short, or super sensitive button, as it will turn on by itself and stay on all the time. The lights on the other one work fine. Another complaint is that the front wheels don't retract - so they are either in or you have to take them out completely. She's getting the hang of using them with only the back wheels, though. She enjoys wearing them, but has limited places to actually use them as she can't wear them to school and our house is mostly carpeted unless she just scoots around in circles in our kitchen. Overall they're decent shoes, but I'm not sure if she would purchase these next time if she were looking for wheeled shoes again."
3.0,Okay so these are a thicker material that the speckled ones . They are not as thin. The contour is a little better but I liked the other ones better material wise
3.0,"When I first put these on, my ears hurt because they were so tight. I had to spend several minutes bending these all sorts of way to finally get them to be comfortable.  They are marketed as unisex but it would have to be a man with a pretty small head to find them comfortable.<br /><br />My main reason for buying them is because they are advertised as foldable. If you have a wide pocket, they can flatten enough to fit in there; they don't get real flat."
3.0,"very pretty, but runs very small"
3.0,I like it but what I paid is what I would get for it also had a little turn color on both item I got so is not worth returning the item because of the turn color it had.
3.0,Socks are cute but they run small.
3.0,These leggings don't stay up. They are slippery and just slide down. Coverage is fine
3.0,Very soft material. Not made for someone with a longer torso also a little wider than I expected.
3.0,"This dress was so pretty, but unfortunately is not made for someone who is not very petite. If you have anything bigger than B cups, this dress will be problematic. The top is very small."
3.0,"Worth the buy for the price, but somewhat of a cheap material."
3.0,"These are a cool novelty and are cheap enough that I bought a bunch for a 4th of July team photo with my company. They're good enough to wear for a bit and, while you can't see well through them, you could easily wear them for an hour or so if you're committed.<br /><br />I take off one star because they're on the cheap side (though you can't expect much at this price). I take off another star (should take off 10 stars for this but I'm trying to be objective about the product itself) for where it's made. These are USA aviators.... made in China.... Do I really need to say more about why this is all wrong? For me at least it totally killed wearing these to know they were made in China."
3.0,"Not as I expected actually. The leather is good,but not the shape."
3.0,A bit on the small side and low quality material. Not constructed as well as Rusty or Billabong but that's expected for the price.
3.0,"I'm not completely satisfied. It's not completely as described. So, it was somewhat ordered based on images. The ice pack placement is good, but they are in a crinkling plastic and it's annoying. Also, I thought that there'd be ice packs in the crown of the cap. there are not. So, the hole on top, that is meant for hair to be pulled through, I have to shove a soft ice pack in, and somehow manage to pull my hair through still. Also, with a full blown migraine and aura, it's pretty difficult to fight positioning, pulling hair through and add in that ice pack. So, all that to say the concept is great, but it has a few areas for improvement."
3.0,Buyer Beware when I received this product and I purchased several of these like three or four they all came broke the zipper wasn't worth a darn none of them would work. I would not purchase this again. This is definitely one of the worse purchases I have ever made. Several of these were bought as a gift I did not give them to the person. There is no reason to return because it would be too much trouble because they don't come from the US. It takes a little longer to receive this purchase due to the fact that they come from overseas.
3.0,I really like the top .I would buy more if the top came in more then one color.
3.0,"This is not quality adidas, I'm disappointed ...The material is thin"
3.0,"This hat, other than the black ribbon, does not look like the photo. It is round, not flat at the top. The brim is not as large as pictured. It arrives all rolled up and even after all this time, the folds are still obvious and are not coming out.<br />There are better hats for the same price."
3.0,My son is very thin but very tall so in some things he fits a large and some things a medium. This was way too wide for him. Returning it and trying a medium.
3.0,I like the product but wished i had ordered a larger size.  From the reviews I concluded that it is better to error on the smaller end and I wished i had ordered a size up.  The ring is also a bit wider than i expected.
3.0,"Too small in size,tight! I had to return."
3.0,There is no instructions that came with the watch.  I didn't know how to set the other two small timers.  The stems are hard to pull out.<br /><br />I would not recommend this watch to anyone.
3.0,The dress is very pretty and is identical to the descrption But it was small for anda me. De
3.0,"This dress was more pink than purple. I should‚Äôve bought an extra large, but instead of exchanging it, I‚Äôm returning it because I wanted it to be a true purple."
3.0,"I bought the blue jumpsuit but found it to be a different product than the orange one. While the color and material are great, it does not have pockets, it has a very different back and different buttons on the front. It's still cute but not what I was expecting."
3.0,The bridge on the nose is too small.  I didn't send it back though. These were for my husband who has a normal/average nose but the bridge was too small.
3.0,"La talla es la indicada est√° bien , los colores muy firmes , la tela de los pu√±os es muy sencilla esperaba mejor calidad de la tela"
3.0,these are made for much smaller noses than an adults nose. They fit my children well. We have not used the ear plugs. Good for the price.
3.0,"They are a lot smaller than I thought, but still beautiful! I will definately be wearing them to match certain outfits, but as a second set of earrings not the first."
3.0,"I ended up returning the item. It‚Äôs awesome as a costume I‚Äôd imaging but it just looks and FEELS so cheap on. Definitely not something I would wear on a regular basis as an actual outfit. Plus, the dress had lipstick on the color upon arrival. I did really like the bright blue color though. It was exactly the shade I wanted."
3.0,"I ordered rose gold and while the package says it‚Äôs rose gold it‚Äôs defintely yellow gold. That being said, it‚Äôs working fine to keep my hole open until I can get in to see my piercer."
3.0,Top is adjustable and fits on smallest setting. Quality leaves a lot to be desired. I don't expect these to last very long.
3.0,This blouse is a crop!!!!!!!!!! Had I known that I would've NOT ordered it!!!! It's really nice and daughter loved it. Maybe with a pair of high waist jeans and heels but that wasn't what I was going for. It's being returned.
3.0,"Nice flowy fabric, will nees ironing snap was sewn off center leaving gaping hole in front, having it altered. 5'5&#34; 165lbs 38c"
3.0,"I really loved the watch, classic watch face with a nice leather band.  Unfortunately, it died after less then a month of wearing it.  I thought it might be a fluke with mine, but my sister had already gotten the same watch and after talking with her, she told me hers died after two weeks of owning it.<br />Therefore, I thought I might post about it to let others know."
3.0,Good quality but will not fit over glasses.
3.0,"The color was true to picture and beautiful.It is a deep red. The fit was a bit big and more boxy looking in the back {no darts just hangs loose}. The picture gives the impression of draping in gathers from the upper waist area down to hem. But when put on, looks more boxy, minimal gathers.  Maybe the smaller sixes are truer to the posted picture , i don't know. Also the bottom of hem line, the picture shows at least 3 inches of see threw lace. Mine had maybe a 1/2 inch. So in order for mine to look like the picutre, i will have to put in darts, and hem up the inner top to show more lace. And take in the sides just a bit, to give more of an hourglass form. Now to find the time to do it......."
3.0,It will given as a gift
3.0,Glad I only needed it for one occasion. Fabric was a bit thin. Donated it after use; wasn't something practical for wear outside of the one special occasion.
3.0,"After reading your reviews which said it ran small I decided to go two sizes up, however that seem to be a bit too big however the sleeves were just the right  Length I only wish it fit correctly."
3.0,Not for lower body days
3.0,I ordered an XL. it was to small. i gave it to my daughter-in-law who wears smalls. just sayin.
3.0,"Shoe looks great, will be sturdy for a busy toddler. But definitely should not have bought 2 sizes up."
3.0,"Definitely needs to be steamed and pills after washing, but a flattering shirt."
3.0,These are definitely comfy and absolutely keep your tootsie‚Äôs warm‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶don‚Äôt get the red ones unless you‚Äôre into looking like Ronald McDonald‚Ä¶lol Seriously!!! ü§£
3.0,The product looks different from actual.
3.0,"I love this bag. It is the perfect size, not too big and not too little. It's roomy and has plenty of room for my goodies. However, it has an awful smell on the inside. I mean, AWFUL! I'm hoping it airs out soon, so I can use this bag!"
3.0,"a lot of items for price, but with medical asks it dose not allow to be attached in any manner that still allows mask to  not have big gaps."
3.0,"Bottoms were tiny, too fit great. It is a snug fit though. Cute top!"
3.0,Son buenos pero vienen m√°s peque√±o de lo normal.
3.0,Thin fabric. Rips easily
3.0,"I only purchased this because I don't have Prime and needed to spend a couple more dollars to get free shipping. That being said, I wasn't really expecting too much. It is cute and my style, but it broke at the jump ring the first time I tried taking it off. I have a bunch of jewelry making supplies handy, so I replaced the jump rings with the ""key chain"" style ones like in the attached picture. Now it hasn't broke, but I will update if it does. It can be a little difficult to tighten with one hand while it's on your wrist. I admit, I have to use my teeth, but my wrists are small and I need to tighten it all the way.<br /><br />All in all, I don't think it was a bad purchase since it was only $3 and I know how to fix jewelry. However if you're looking for a higher quality item or a gift, I would purchase something else."
3.0,It‚Äôs too pixelated but my 5 year old loves it regardless.
3.0,"Came quickly- runs small both around and cups. Does not separate bust- smooshed together. Not very supportive material, and hard to put on. but for the price, and that it comes quickly, it might work well for you"
3.0,Very little agate and very big hole!
3.0,One of the earrings was missing!
3.0,"Useless for regular/average ladies bracelets, which is what I wanted it for. Nice for large bracelets, but I don't make them. Also, the measurements are odd, I'll try to get a pic and update this post later today. Think I'm going to return it."
3.0,Boot paint is extremely poorly done. Completely off center. The boots appear scuffed and slightly used.
3.0,Nice watch but not the same picture
3.0,I really like the style of this purse. I bought it for a PGA tournament. It only lasted the first day.. by the second day the cross body strap broke off from the clear portion. Good for short term use but had hoped to keep it and reuse at my next event.
3.0,I didn‚Äôt like the size it was xxx and I‚Äôm a xx and it didn‚Äôt fit me at all
3.0,Was too thick for my liking.
3.0,"The shoes are exactly as I expected; however, I am doubtful about their authenticity since I purchased the same pair a couple years ago in Nordstrom rack and the insole is very different."
3.0,They are adorable. But difficult to put in and stay in. The end is blunt and not pointed which made it difficult to put in easily.
3.0,"I got the coral and grey ombre tank. The colors were lovely and I really wanted to love it, but it was WAY too big and had an awkward fit. I ordered an XL, but would probably need a Medium for a decent fit, but even then the armpit holes were kinda droopy and the rest of it was pretty boxy looking on me. I don't see a way for this to look flattering on a curvy figure unless maybe you twisted up part of it at the bottom to reign it in a bit.<br /><br />For size reference, I'm 5'4, 36DD and around 190lbs at the time of purchase. Definitely size down!"
3.0,"I can't say how these hold up, but so soft and cute. With boots you need to size up for socks. My toddler wears an 8 in toms without socks. I got the 9 in this boot. It's basically the equivalent to her toms 8. I'm going to order a 10 so she can wear socks with them."
3.0,The product appeared to be well made.  I ordered a smaller size like was recommended by other reviews.  I returned due to being entirely too large.
3.0,"Love the print and size of this cap! But the pleats were wayyy offf. Had to see them down. But after doing that, this cap is awesome!"
3.0,"Good earrings but the backs are not as tight as they should be. They occasionally slip when taking off shirts, so you have to be careful. Good shine tho."
3.0,They‚Äôre a really fun color and sit so light in the face. I‚Äôm returning mine because they are so transparent. I like mirrored lenses because I like the opacity. Here you can totally see my eyes right through the glasses. Back to the drawing board for some fun shades this summer.
3.0,Hubby got this for me for Christmas. I love how this watch love and the fact that it fits perfectly but the clasp does not stay closed which is super disappointing.
3.0,"If you do not have sensitive skin that breaks out when in contact with nickel and other metals, this band might work for you.<br /><br />I cannot wear products that contain nickel. This band caused my wrist to break out. The metal fasteners that got in contact with my wrist caused me to have a breakout and rendered my band unwearable. I have been wearing my fitness tracker without any breakouts for 3+ months, so I know the breakout was caused by this band. I wish I could have a refund, but I would rather someone else be spared the money and trouble of ordering if they know they have sensitive skin.<br /><br />I am off to find the original band makers.<br />Happy Shopping!"
3.0,The design is great. The fit for adults is definitely tight because of the interwoven patterns. Feels like they were designed for people with smaller calves.
3.0,"Cute dress. There is a wrinkle sewed into the waistline of the dress on the front. Probably should have returned it, but I wanted it for an event and didn't have time to reorder. Not too noticeable, but it's there."
3.0,"The second I took these out of the packaging, they disintegrated. I had to hunt down all the little pieces and reassemble the earrings with pliers myself. They are beautiful, however, just a lot of work."
3.0,Stretches out really fast
3.0,The material is extremely thin but I should be able to match it up with something to pull off an outfit.
3.0,Would have been great top but it‚Äôs too small and felt tight fitting. Sadly had to return.
3.0,"Buena calidad ,<br />Pero son peque√±os"
3.0,"This fit well. Handled the elements in Chicago's windy rainy weekend we went to the Bears game. However, the Zipper would jam a lot. It also has Velcro flaps that were super annoying to cover the zipper line. Pockets were large but placed weird."
3.0,"but it is tie , still good to wear with out socks , i don't like shoes without socks !"
3.0,"Buena relaci√≥n, precio/calidad!"
3.0,Looks nice but has a plastic smell.
3.0,Pants were as expected- except for the waistband.  It‚Äôs a fake drawstring which sits weird with how baggy the pants are.  Sadly it was a deal breaker and I returned. Other than the waistband-they were cute.
3.0,I wanted to love this but ended up returning it bc it was so large on me.
3.0,I got it right before the date. The quality not as I expected it to be. I'm a size Large so I order a size Large but was to smallüò´did not fit.
3.0,Great quality. It runs extremely small. I usually wear a small sports bra but this one is very tight.
3.0,"The color was to have been white, and it appears a vivid white in the picture, but it‚Äôs an off-white/cream color. The fabric is very thin. I had to steam it to get into a shape to be worn. I think once washed it will not hold a nice shape."
3.0,I go these PJs for Christmas last year. The top is quite small/tight and the pants are overly baggy. Strange combo. Nice materials.
3.0,Very see<br />Through
3.0,Es igual a la foto...queda linda
3.0,"Too small! This had the best reviews, not just on Amazon, but we returned these and went with sandals what can go into water instead."
3.0,I expected this dress to be a little bigger or true to size. It was a little too small in the bust area. Glad I have a sister to hand it over to.
3.0,"The band itself was the correct diameter, but the spring pins were simply not long enough and did not work. The fix was to remove the pins and insert the correct diameter. The rubber material made it easy to do."
3.0,We could not get the date function to work.  We returned this beautiful watch.
3.0,Love it but size runs a little large
3.0,"The batteries that were installed were useless. I almost sent it back. Luckily, I had a couple of watch batteries in the house and swapped them out. It is definitely much brighter. I am hoping to have good results with the light from this point on."
3.0,"didn't notice it was silver plated at time of purchase, too shinny."
3.0,They are adorable but the fit is way way too tight. I ordered up a size and it was still tight. Also material is cheap.
3.0,"These are for babies, not for small children."
3.0,ordered these by mistake and they are way too large andvlon
3.0,The purse is cute and simple -- exactly what i was looking for.  But it is very stiff and even when unzipped all the way (the zipper goes far down on each side) it is hard to open and keep open.  I tend to use drive through and listen to audio books on my phone and I can't easily put my wallet or phone back in my purse with one hand.
3.0,Like the same as the gray sweater does dont fit waste of money
3.0,Chanin to short.
3.0,They are cute. The graphics are not as they seem. They are more faded. The strings broke as I was putting around my 7 year old ears. It is mentioned that only 4 come in a pack but I got 5 so that was good since one broke.
3.0,Little right across the bust
3.0,Cute but the pearls are too big.
3.0,Shirt falls above waist. Returned item.
3.0,They go together really good
3.0,"I order my usually size and it was too small. Order the size up. Secondly, it is a wool cotton blend and feels like it too. Wash in the machine, then line dry. Do not place it in the dryer."
3.0,"Was hoping for a looser fit, this is more fitted. Thus the 3 stars. Would've been 5 stars if it was a bit looser. I got a size Medium. Usually mediums are a little more spacious, loose.<br />The material is thin, lightweight, not bulky, and is soft.<br />It's a good looking hoodie."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:4f554fb62eeeefb3d32ff47219b1372e]] I love the style, look, feel of the boot however didn‚Äôt get a chance to try them out since upon opening the package I noticed that they had been previously used. One had a scuffle mark on the inside left boot. The ball of the foot on both boots clearly indicated they had been worn. I‚Äôm a tad peeved but can‚Äôt deny it was a very solid pick if only they were brand new as promised. Have returned but not sure I want to order again just to be sent another pre-own pair..."
3.0,"So, let me be perfectly honest, these gauges look really good. However, they are smaller than expected. Typically the flares are sized up slightly larger than the center. I purchased the 0g(8mm) and the flares are 8mm. The center is much closer to a 2g, meaning they will probably fall out. I would recommend getting a size larger than you normally would to compensate. Unfortunately they don't offer these in a 00g so, I'm stuck with great looking gauges that don't want to stay in."
3.0,Like the look and weight. The clasp is a real bummer...will be list within two weeks. üòû
3.0,"This skirt is not true to size. The length is short and the waist is most likely too small for a toddler. DO NOT BUY.<br /><br />*The company contacted me after the poor review of their product. They reimbursed me in full and apologized for the inconvenience. Because of their cooperation, I am going to bump them up to 3 stars."
3.0,The top was cute but way to small.
3.0,"Fit is perfect, but the color is off compared to the picture. It looks more of a deep purple than the a true mocha brown. Disappointing but still better than nothing."
3.0,Not bad.  Better for winter riding in Texas.
3.0,Good but not great. They both fit very well but the smaller ones stone is not seated properly. Guess 9.99 what should I expect. You  would think they would be inspected before shipping.
3.0,"I had to wash this as soon as I took it out of the package, the fabric dye smell was very strong. It fits well for the width, but as far as the length on the longest strap placement it is barely tall enough for me at 5ft 6inches. I was worried ordering large would have it be too wide for me, which would not be flattering at all.  They are very comfy though, and I wear them around the house quite a bit."
3.0,Very nice and shipping takes to 7 days and only problem i had is one of the hearts chipped.
3.0,It's kinda missing the triangle design that's the entire reason I bought it. Also the packaging was open when I got it. I guess everything else was there so it's kinda ok?
3.0,"The extra pair of gold earrings are very pretty, but impossible for me to wear.  The piece going through the ear was so big that it actually hurt to put them on.  Can't wear them.  Am still deciding if I like the large part of the earring in the back, but these are very pretty earrings."
3.0,I was super excited about this and it was way to small. I‚Äôm a 36c and I ordered the large. I could barely squeeze myself into this and then when I got it on I was smashed in and over flowing from all sides and it was cutting my back fat circulation off. The quality is really good but the sizing is was off.
3.0,The bras fit however next time I order I will go up a size. Ordered 2x but they are a little snug.
3.0,"a lot bigger than a real gucci belt, looks real from a far but the belt is alot thicker and logo is really big."
3.0,"This is the cutest bathing suit, but it tore Very easily."
3.0,"For claiming to be silk this feels and looks a lot like polyester. The caps make up for the unimpressive durags. The tail is shorter than I expected. However, for the price, you get more than what you would at other places for sure."
3.0,"While this is really cute, the strap is awful, it looks and feels like a phone charging cable, it‚Äôs not comfortable. I like everything else so I‚Äôm just going to replace the strap with a better one. Great for the price. Get what you pay for üòÜ"
3.0,It stretches and fits...however...it doesn't bend to match your waist and  is stiff at each side
3.0,Very attractive. Case is great!  Can't beat the glasses for the price!
3.0,Too big in the chest
3.0,The face area is beautiful.  The ear loops hurt after a couple hours of wearing it.
3.0,Just okay band with poor quality finish on buckle. Chrome looking finish is peeling off after just a few months.
3.0,"I‚Äôm usually a medium, but I always size up for comfort clothes. The top for fine but the pants were a little tight for what I was wanting."
3.0,Flimsy. Too cheaply made. Not really good looking on.  I threw it away.
3.0,"Love the style of this for my large Garmin smartwatch. But though this is obviously made for women, it's HUGE. I'm an adult, and I've got it on the last hole. There are 8. If it stretches at all, it won't be snug enough for the heart rate monitor to work. And of course it's not great having almost 3"" of extra band sticking out.<br /><br />Solutions: Make this one a bit smaller or make 2 sizes."
3.0,Not sure what I expected. It is fine.
3.0,"Sizing for this brand very inconsistent. I wear 6.5, and in a different styled purchased recently that was fine. This shoe is smaller, and pinched at the toe. Extremely unwearable."
3.0,"I like the wallet, but I wish it was a little wider."
3.0,I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear and the arms were still way too tight.  I guess if you want to buy this go two sizes bigger than normal.
3.0,Pretty & comfortable. fit well
3.0,"We got a size medium, but it fits more of a small in the arms and shoulder area.  I was not able to even get my arm in it, so I would order up.<br />The design is a little bohemian."
3.0,"These are very cute earrings, they would be a favorite pair but they constantly slip out and almost fall off.  I‚Äôm always afraid I‚Äôm going to lose one."
3.0,Masks seemed a little small. Only certain ones would fit my face around my eyes. The ribbon on the masks were coming off and I had to glue the one I wanted to use.
3.0,band is tearing just days after getting it
3.0,[[VIDEOID:222c9d4047f508049e8059aaf552c63c]] So comfortable..literally feels like you have nothing on. True to size. I have loved them until now I started wearing my ring daily bc I started going back to the gym and just not seeing that it's eating up my finger. It's more itchy than regular so I took it off and when I looked I realized my finger is raw all around almost. Super itchy. So I guess these rings don't work for me.
3.0,Good workmanship but not well engineered. Hard to buckle and unbuckle time consuming
3.0,Kind of thin... fits smaller than says I think.
3.0,"Little big, crappy material but still fun"
3.0,These are great but one of my clickers has a malfunctioning clasp and it does not close.<br />Other than that everything was good.
3.0,"Very cute, but material has no stretch. Hard to get over my daughter‚Äôs head. Elastic on arms is tight. I ordered up, to a 3T, expecting it to be roomy. She usually wears 24 month, or 2T, she‚Äôs 33 inches and 28 lbs. I was overall very disappointed with the material, and fit of the neck/sleeves."
3.0,"too big, cannot make bracelet smaller"
3.0,"I like the product but had to return it, as I ordered the wrong size."
3.0,"The color and Terry cloth were great. However, a large in this brand was more like a medium so you might bear that in mind."
3.0,"The mom bracelet came apart the second day. My daughter wears hers everyday to school and it is still in great shape after a month.<br />If one had to unravel, I'm glad it was the mother one because my daughter would have been so sad if hers broke.  The beads have fallen off of hers, but otherwise it is still tied and stays on her wrist."
3.0,The bottom fits good my problem is the top is to small I wear a 44dd ordered a 5x and the has no support. The only reason I didn‚Äôt send it back was because of the bottom being so freaking cute
3.0,"Nice, but too small"
3.0,"If you're looking for an inexpensive pair of sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays than you can't go wrong with this item. The only issue for me personally was that the glasses were too large for my face. Other than this one issue I would have kept the glasses and worn them along with my other sunglasses. I should also mention that this style is not necessarily the best one for me as I have a longer, narrower face. For most people, however, they would probably work out well as they are on the smaller end of the aviator scale. The colors are exactly as pictured and were really very cool."
3.0,"These are okay bracelets, they need to be burnt on the ends in order for them to stay on. Several of them have started to fray and have lost their bright colors after getting wet and been in the sun. But my kids like them so that's all that matters."
3.0,They were small and expected to be more gold
3.0,HOWEVER THEW ADJUSTING CLASPS ARE A LITTLE HARD TO GET THEM TO SLIDE TO ADJUST
3.0,The end clasps are squared off. When its on and your moving your wrist around....they are sharp and irritates your skin.
3.0,THESE JACKET RUN SMALL BUT OK FOR ME
3.0,"For some reasons, when I first opened it and took the cords out, the lobster clasps were just falling like it's raining cats and dogs up in here. It was such a bother to have to go and find out which ones the fallen lobster clasps came from and reattached it. Then just when you thought you finished, another falls and you have to repeat the process all over again. -sigh- I hope this doesn't happen when I make little gifts for my friends and hear they complaining about losing my handmade charms."
3.0,This product fits but it's meant for girls that have little boobies lol little to none honestly and I'm a 40 C cup and it just covers my nipples LOL
3.0,I like but I think it‚Äôs to big and the price is a little to high
3.0,It‚Äôs was really cute but thin
3.0,"I own another version of this hat and I like that one very much. The logo on my other hat is white. I thought this was the same hat when I ordered it, but this one's logo is definitely silver. Unfortunately, I think the silver is ugly and won't wear it. Also, for those who care, my other hat has a gold sticker which is really cool but this one has a silver sticker."
3.0,These are cute. We haven‚Äôt worn them in the water yet so I am hoping they last. I ordered a size and a half up based on other reviews and I‚Äôm so happy I did. These for perfect. So my recommendation is order 1-5-2 sizes up if you order your true size they will likely be too small.
3.0,Not last long
3.0,"First let‚Äôs start with the positive‚Ä¶<br />The shirt is made of a stretchy slinky material and is comfortable on the body and opaque.<br />It also can be worn reversibly (front to back.)<br />The length is good for leggings, covering front and back. And the slit up the sides is flattering and cute!<br />Negatives:<br />It does run small. I‚Äôm usually a medium and went with a large which fit well.<br />The shoulder ‚Äústrap‚Äù area is too thick. It‚Äôs almost like they designed it to be a tee shirt but forgot the sleeves. (This would be hidden with a cardigan over top.)<br />The armholes are a bit too big and show my bra a bit."
3.0,"If you are big chested, this is not the shirt style for you. I am and it was suffocating. I sent it back and ordered the next size up and it was still super tight in the chest and it wrinkles big time. Im scared to death to wash and dry it so I just returned it."
3.0,I ordered this recently as I have been trying to incorporate more warm clothes that I can layer. For ref: I am 5ft 4 280 lbs 44 DDD and typically wear a 2X or 3X in clothes I ordered a size XXL in this which I am assuming translates to 2X its basically been a size I have luck with almost 80-85% of the time given the stretch and fabric of the material which I have been paying closer attention to. As for fit this has stretch everywhere which isn't a bad thing but the stretch is one where it's a baggy fit not a comformed fits the body nicely fit more of a frumpy fit which to me is a little disappointing since I like my clothes to be more fitted not tight or snug but form fitting with a little room so it doesn't bring attention to my stomach but shows off my better assits if you know what I mean. This for me was just not that I will try again to see but upon trying on I was sorely met with that and I had been having pretty good luck with shirts too.
3.0,Intermedio
3.0,"They don't like to keep up with tracking so I had no idea where it was when it was. And when I received them they looked very cheap, and dull, much smaller than I thought they would be. 2 or 3 of my gems were missing. But all in all for the low price for all 10, the deal is very good compared to places like walmart, who charged $12-20 for 1-5 in set, and are uglier. I'm about 75% happy with the product but I won't return it."
3.0,This product is super cute. But I only give it 3 stars because the material is very thin and had wholes within a few months.
3.0,"I am wearing 38B or even C and ordered M. M should be very, very small for my size.<br /><br />The band is size M. Sadly, the cups are huge and offer no support at all. I would think that this bra could make a thin woman with DD very happy.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's not suitable for cups A-C.<br /><br />It's a shame because otherwise, the bras make a fabulous impression. Sadly, I have to return them. The band would be too small in size S, while the cups would potentially still not have a snug fit."
3.0,"Was cute, but the post was a bit too long and the gems didn't fit my ear curvature right."
3.0,"Humm , the color is not the same"
3.0,Love the style but it was too tight around the hip area.
3.0,I‚Äôm very satisfied with this item. Their just right for a cool day.
3.0,"I usually go up a size when buying long sleeve shirts to accommodate my larger arms, but it didn't work well because the shirt has poofy shoulders that are exaggerated if you buy a size too big. The shirt was very long so it's best when tucked in. I didn't have enough time to return to get a smaller size so I threw on a sweater. All in all it was a nice shirt, got me the job I interviewed for."
3.0,"It‚Äôs a beatiful dress, pattern and fit, but it is see through, the fabric is so thin your underwear shows. I have to wear a slip underneath for it to kinda work."
3.0,"I got this bra in the same size I normally wear and it fits but my breasts are hanging out over the cups. The front closure is all twisted and stretched out like it is barely staying closed. Its a pretty bra and it's comfortable in the back and shoulders, just too small for me."
3.0,Well made T - Shirt that would equal a Medium size.  I will have to give it to someone else.
3.0,"Both the jersey and the shorts have a tight rubbery substance that feels like a rubber band against your arms and legs.  Other kits that I have purchased didn't have it and I don't particularly like it. However, it may not bother some.  Just not for me.  Other than that, the product looks like it is good quality.  I decided to return mine and try another product."
3.0,Much smaller than I thought and of the two pair one pair had missing eye stones. Ran out of time to return. Oh well. Got what i paid for I guess. Nothing a glue gun cant fix!
3.0,"These gloves are advertised as one size fits all, they do not...<br />I am an average sized man and these gloves fit so tight that they almost cut off the circulation in my hands..<br />One size does not fit all."
3.0,Fit ok but the color wasn't quite what I expected. Easy to pack and bring so I kept!
3.0,"Looks pretty on screen , but still not ugly in person. Unless ur mom's from the British-india's time, don't buy her this, otherwise she'll just pretend to like it."
3.0,I liked for the price. It gives you great cleavage... but made my boobs look pointy when I wore cotton material tops. Looks great with shear...  i posted picture with me in a sheer hot pink dress
3.0,Doesn't look as stylish as expected.
3.0,"I bought the Large size for my 36+ inch waist and the elastic waist on these shorts stretches out to at least 40.  The  included belt is necessary because the elastic is too lose but with the belt on the fabric bunches up under the belt and it looks like a diaper.  On the other hand, the dark green with the grey trim and grey belt looks really nice.  That same color in the Medium size is not available so no shorts for me.  The other green color, the ""B"" color, is nice too but that color costs almost ten dollars more.  The search for shorts continues."
3.0,I didn‚Äôt wear it for a workout it was way to large for me! I‚Äôm sure someone will get good use out of them. I will be donating them
3.0,It was much bigger than I expected. It felt like a men's jacket.
3.0,"They are really big and fall down my leg if I do not have boots on. They look great with boots but once I take the boots off they fall down,"
3.0,It is a little itchy.  i dont think i could wear it for very long.
3.0,It is very cute but wished it was longer. It fit very snuggly. You may want to size up.
3.0,"Fits awkwardly on my wrist in a way that's uncomfortable and is tight, but slides around at the same time.<br />The functions are great though!"
3.0,Not quite what I was looking for. This is more of a T-shirt material and I was looking for spandex type mayerial
3.0,"This product is just okay. After soaking overnight, it wasn‚Äôt clean enough so I spent almost an hour vigorously scrubbing before I gave up and said it is what it is. Here are the before and after pics. I think I can get the same results with laundry detergent though‚Ä¶"
3.0,To small should of went with a bigger size
3.0,The comfort in these mask aren‚Äôt bad but spend your money on better masks! The white madk was shipped dirty and the black one was missing the stones.
3.0,"Its silky however it stays on your head, an ok head bonnet"
3.0,broke after a year
3.0,The bracelet is decent in finish and feels great on the wrist but the clasp has very sharp edges and is cheap feeling.
3.0,"While I love the weight and the bead colors, the bands at the ends of each cord tend to stretch and release the arms of my glasses (both readers and sunglasses) after a short time. Now I use them to keep knitting needles together as a set while not being used. Very disappointing."
3.0,Beautiful but it runs small I ordered an XL and it fit like a small
3.0,"I got this a lot sooner than expected so I forgot what I ordered!  When I saw I ordered an XL I thought, hmmmm, I must have gone by ‚Äúrecommended for you.‚Äù Typically I wear a L sometimes a M. Slipped it on, way too big, but fell in love with a cute, flirty nighty!  Not a dress....bummer!  Now, to be truthful, I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù & 155. Had I ordered a Medium & put a pair of white leggings underneath - maybe I could‚Äôve pulled off an outfit...but it really does look & feel like a nightgown...BUT I LOVE IT!!!  Totally keeping it just for that, too.  Just wish I would‚Äôve gotten it in a large since that‚Äôs the case.  I like room - but not that much.  Do love the pockets.  Comfy.  I know my hubby will like it, too."
3.0,"These are exactly what you'd expect, cheap wire frame readers. (and I mean cheaply made, cheap feel, all of that) I was going to give them 2 star because 2 out of 3 pair gave me a headache but after some minor (and very gentle) adjustment by bending the frames and the nose pieces, I found I could use all 3 pairs. They would be 4 star if I did not have to do that.<br />After using these I will also say that their comfort is limited and so they will be throw downs for me, backup pairs. I cannot give up my pricier, more comfortable, sets that are in the $8-10 ea. price range that I can wear comfortably for long periods of time. But those pairs have broken on me so I put a pair of these in the garage, an extra pair at work, and one in the desk drawer by my computer.<br />They are what they are, low cost (low comfort) and somewhat fragile readers. No springs in the bows and be gentle if they need adjustment."
3.0,Comfy shoe but they quality is okay.
3.0,These look cheap. The edge on one side is totally flat instead of rounded. I did use some of them.
3.0,Band stretched out pretty quick.  Within a month and I only wore it part time.  And it seemed to loosen up easily.
3.0,I love the CAROLINA logo. The mask itself won‚Äôt stay up. I am average in size and the mask will not stay up on my face.
3.0,The only reason I‚Äôm not giving it five stars is because it is not the ribbed sweater material I thought it would be it is more of a stretchy elastic cotton maybe polyester material I‚Äôm not sure. The dress fits nice though I‚Äôm  5 foot five weight 150 pounds measurements are 36C 30 inch waist 42 inch hips .
3.0,The sleeves are too small for the size of the jacket.  Love the color and style.  I have it to my mother.  It fit her better than me.
3.0,"Overall these Overalls are super cute, great color with nice stretch. They just run way smaller than expected causing the buttons to pull at the hips.  So if you have wide hips &#34;Don't even bother!&#34;"
3.0,Fit was fine. Just a little shorter than I expected
3.0,"The first wear was awesome. I love the shirt. The problem is that when I took it from the wash, it had what looked like grease spots on it but there was no oil or grease in the laundry. I will still wear it with an infinity scarf to cover the spots"
3.0,Was not as good of material as indicated. Wife was not impressed.
3.0,The shoe was cute however glitter got everywhere and the bow came off later that night. Meh....
3.0,"The dress fit great! The length was a little short for a 5‚Äô9, 145 lb girl. I received lots of compliments but the one thing I hated was the red bled on to the white during shipment. Didn‚Äôt notice til I got to work but my white area on dress was now pink. I can never wear this dress again because that‚Äôs not coming out."
3.0,Shirt tail too long
3.0,I‚Äôve purchased a few tennis skirts this Summer and this one fit tighter. Just wanted to give other buyers a heads up.
3.0,Based on previous comments I purchased an extra large....I am 5&#34;1 and 129lbs...this size is a little song on the arms but free sized elsewhere. Very soft and pretty.
3.0,"It is bulky, but protective."
3.0,I like the design but the hated the material.... It's a see through material and black undergarment has to worn.
3.0,Makes it softer against my head but the sleeves themselves are not soft.
3.0,"The dress was incredibly short. Like, nearly shirt length. Now, I'm a tall girl, 6', so take that how you will and I can wear it with leggings. However, what urks me is that the waist line is perfectly fit, but the chest is about three sizes too big! I just fixed it myself with some pins and plan on sewing it. Returning it is far too much effort, but I swear it was made for someone far bustier than the size chart suggested...."
3.0,"This romper is super cute and very well made, but it was way too big for my daughter. I got the size 18-24 months but this would fit her when she's 3 at least. She still hasn't been able to use it after 8 months of being purchased."
3.0,Smaller than expected But very nice
3.0,I am usually a 10/12 in dresses and a large is way too tight for me. Should have ordered an XL or even a XXL.<br /><br />For the fit - the shoulders do not fit as pictured and are a bit awkward.<br /><br />Length is perfect and isn't see thru in the navy color. Pay attention to size and this dress will be very flattering on most body types.
3.0,Denim 2 different colors....not like picture
3.0,"For people with small heads, so I returned it"
3.0,"Don‚Äôt buy it‚Äôs cheap, and it broke to fast"
3.0,"Weird design, the hanging component on the inside doesn't allow you to hang entire bag in closet. Also, hanging component is very little so you can pack very few items. One of the zipper's broke on first Zip."
3.0,"This dress was purchased with the intent to wear it to a family get together.  However, I don‚Äôt believe I will be able to.  I finally received the product after almost two weeks and was sadly disappointed when I took it out of the package.  There was no belt for one and for two I ordered larger than I usually wear to guarantee fit and that didn‚Äôt even help.  I love the colors on this dress I thought it was beautiful but now it will be a beautiful piece to sit in my closet.  The dress did not fit very well and there was a small tear under the arm of the dress.  The dress is very light and airy which is fantastic but at a price.  The dress makes your undergarments very visible.  I guess if you had a slip it would be great.  I‚Äôm not sure what bra you would wear with that seeing as having large breasts makes wearing a strapless bra a feat.  The dress is beautiful and pretty, hopefully I can wear it sometime.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.  This review contains opinions that are mine and mine alone."
3.0,"Not very comfortable and not well made.  I know, I know... what do I expect from something that cost under $6. A tad more than what I got."
3.0,Received in timely fashion.  The dress is too small to be marked XXL.  I've purchase the exact same dress in red size xxl.  I purchased the green hoping for same fit.  Had to return it.  Scared to re-order the green - it might come back two sizes smaller and marked xxl.  Are they cut from the same pattern?  How in the world do you get a different fit by changing the color?  Darn it!  Because of that - 3 stars.
3.0,"The clasp is so tiny I couldn't open it. As I was trying to open it, the necklace started falling apart. I was able to add another clasp and fix it but I wouldn't recommend it. It is cute though and wearable after changing out the clasp."
3.0,It is larger than i thought. Nice quality
3.0,Thank God I sew for a living or  I would of been PISSED.<br /><br />Not exactly sure who considers these pants to be &#34;slim&#34; but they're massive. So oversized it was almost comical. The legs are so wide I'm not really sure who these were made for.<br /><br />Frankly I'm too lazy to return them and it will take me 30 mins to fix the issue. Otherwise... I'd be PISSED.
3.0,The fit was good but they have an extra set of belt loops unlike the listed item. The extra set of belt loops looks unusual. Returned.
3.0,Cute but is changing color so disappointed
3.0,There is no way your breast remains covered. I will have to use double side clothing tape.
3.0,It‚Äôs very dull looking. Was expecting to see more color.
3.0,Nipples are too low & make you look like you sag :( wish the nipples were placed higher.
3.0,I think this it was too small because the once that dont have elastic all around don't fitt very great if you weight 180 but other then that bery beutiful skirt!!
3.0,I thought it would be a bit larger.  Looks less expensive than I had thought.
3.0,Pretty color top
3.0,Dress size fits smaller than size quoted eg if you a size aust 18 choose size 22
3.0,They have a smell to the masks.
3.0,Order 2 sizes up if you want a loose fit. I ordered 1 size up and it was still tight.
3.0,"Fits well, comfortable, works fine for water aerobics in pool. Sole material is very soft; got holes in them immediately just from walking around pool. Will look for something else."
3.0,"I was a little disappointed with the chain‚Äî I think it looks cheap next to the pendant. But the pendant itself is pretty. I don‚Äôt know that I would use the colorful balls in it, but I wore it without one on a different chain I had and was happy with it."
3.0,This bra is wireless and comfortable.  The lymphatic part a far cry from true. The fact that they are  insinuating that this bra corrects and reshapes the Breast on a permanent basis üôÑ üòÇ is a fantasy.  So don't  be fool. It's  a wireless bra. Nothing  more.
3.0,"First, the beautiful rose gold shiny color that is on them when you get them is beautiful. Unfortunately after 1 wash, it fades to a matte grey, which is disappointing. Second this is not a high compression legging, and the waist band is not sewn securely with the strip of elastic inside the pant, so it rolls when active."
3.0,Still cute but not as long as it looks in the photo. It is a standard t shirt length.
3.0,The color came off within Days.
3.0,"Fits great, super stretchy material. Just wish the pants were longer. I have long legs and these went about 3 inches above my ankles O_o - don't recommend if you're tall."
3.0,Ordered the taupe and it‚Äôs definitely cream color.  Not taupe at all. The lettering doesn‚Äôt show up very good.
3.0,"This skirt is beautiful and classy, but the zipper is faulty and gets stuck easily, very difficult to zip up or down. Unfortunately I had to return this."
3.0,Very delicate and chintzy for what I paid. I could've gotten similar ones for half the price that would've worked just as well as this one.
3.0,i was expecting a little more support but it still cute on im a 36/C for reference<br />more cropped then seems in pics too
3.0,Take note this is much thinner than the actual band for the Hauwei watch.by about 2 mm.<br />might not notice at first but over time or when you see the original band you will notice.<br />the clasp is pretty good and the quality is pretty good. it fits the Hauwei but not the way all other branded ones do.
3.0,Looked great but too long in the mid section
3.0,I just don't like all the manufacturer info stamped on one side.
3.0,"The material is not very soft, and actually is quiet noisy. Feels like it wont make it through many washes. I liked the overall silhouette, as i was specifically looking for a mid calf length overall skirt, but I do agree with the other reveiwer that the bib seems very large."
3.0,Or supportive as expected and thin
3.0,"These are cute shoes, but halfway into the school year, they‚Äôre absolutely shredded. They don‚Äôt hold up nearly as well as other Sperrys we have purchased. Disappointing."
3.0,Broke as soon as I opened them
3.0,I didn‚Äôt hate it. The colors were vivid and it was comfortable. The material was very easy to tear and felt cheap though compared to other similar priced items. It also came with several long threads I had to cut. Definitely a single wear.
3.0,Por a utility matetilook like paper
3.0,"Love the colors, the material was ok.  It runs a bit large and is a little boxy"
3.0,Loops were too small to fit the suit's latch
3.0,I like the dress it's nice like the color
3.0,I would size down. It was a little boxy.
3.0,The saree did not have blouse as it was mentioned.
3.0,I had to buy 2 sets because 1 earring would not stay latched. I love the beauty of them.
3.0,"I like the belt, but it has an odor.  I like it with my maxi dresses and tunic shirts too."
3.0,"This is a pretty shoe, stylish and simple, which I really appreciate about Franco Sarto.  However, I no longer can size these correctly; I don't know what has changed over the years but it seems like they must be made in a different place and run much smaller than the stated size.  I bought these in a 10 and even as I removed from box I could see they were for a much smaller foot, and I bought another pair (diff style) in an 11 to compare and it wouldn't go on fully either.  Sarto needs to review their sizing and at least, offer two more sizes up if they can no longer fit normal size 10 or 11 feet.  Returning, very disappointed, because this was a style I would have worn a lot."
3.0,"Very Cute. I love the low cut dress. Material a little clingy. Would be nice if it had a liner, but for the price a girl can't complain. Cute hat and belt to go with it. overall, i am very hahppy with the outfit"
3.0,So very small... nice design
3.0,So i ordered these shoes and received them very quickly which was great.  I normally wear a size 8 in every shoe.  So after reading the reviews on this show I ordered the 8.5/9.  When i put them on they are so big everywhere else except the toe area.  I want to return them for the smaller size but I‚Äôm afraid it would be too tight.  My heel falls right out of the shoe when I walk.  I was really looking forward to these shoes as I work 12 hours a day on my feet in a hospital and I currently suffer from severe plantar fasciitis pain.  Anyone have any ideas?
3.0,It is very wide. My foot swims in it a bit.
3.0,I bought these to wear around the house so I don't mind the cheaper price but they are very thin!  Just OK.
3.0,"The color is faded not as vibrant as you would expect for a brand new item. The fit is not for average USA sized women. My sister is a medium and small boned and slim the sweater purchased was a large and it appeared tight. It is not at all cozy or fluffy. Pretty standard in size and thinner than it appears. I would not purchase this item again. Was disappointed in it. However, my sister being herself simply loved it because it was a gift. So I did not return"
3.0,"Cheap quality,  cute for young girl but not the best quality."
3.0,"Got the plum color which I absolutely love. Features are as explained. It's larger than I expected but apart from that, no complaints."
3.0,Had a small hole when taken out of package but also fit tighter then anticipated.
3.0,"They are pretty, but a lot smaller than I like."
3.0,"They're cute, but it is a bit of a strange fit. The jeans are loose in the waist and tighter in the thigh area, not exactly the loose boyfriend jean look I was going for, but I've been looking for a affordable ripped jeans look like this for awhile so I'll keep them. When I put my belt on tighten up the waist they are much cuter. I listened to the size up reviews, glad I did. I'm 5""5 120lbs usually a size 0/2. I went with a size 5, though they loose in waist like I said. They would of been way TOO tight in the thigh area if I got my regular size."
3.0,love the watch but the adjuster arm pops out of place when in my pocket on occasion stopping the watch.  Going to contact the company about a replacement.
3.0,i have hairs on the wrist and it pulls them because of the design otherwise its ok watch
3.0,Info written is not enclosed and can rub off.
3.0,I do not like the quality of this dress.  I also do not like the fit.  I had to purchase a 2X and I wear a size 14.
3.0,It came in handy when it was super cold out
3.0,"first time out of the drier, these were too short."
3.0,"36dd. I REALLLY wanted to love it. However, instant I tried to tie the halter around my neck, I hear the dreaded sound of something snapping. A few seams on the STRING had snapped. It's salvageable. However. The fit is not it (for me). Typically I don't mind nipples popping out since it's fixed with pasties. You can see nipple from the side if you don't double tape this down. All this together is just irritating. If you have double sided tape and don't mind the seams on the strings being a lil weak, it's not terrible."
3.0,Scratched up like crazy after a while. Quality isn't worth the price.
3.0,"I ordered an XL, based on their chart and they sent me a 3X. I washed and dried them to shrink a bit and it sort of worked. Shorts look great! I love that black and white.<br />I did not want to return them because I wasn‚Äôt sure what size I‚Äôd get back.<br />I guess with this company, they don‚Äôt care what they send you.<br />I won‚Äôt ever order from them anymore."
3.0,"So I am a small female & this mask was way too big for my face. Definitely a shame as I am a big Sailor Moon fan, the design was also in a spot where you can‚Äôt see it when the mask is on."
3.0,some pieces were sewed upside down and the shirt fabric is a weird material but its pretty good
3.0,"I really liked these, but they are crooked on me, and because they‚Äôre made of a flexible material, you literally can‚Äôt adjust them. I tried to bend them in numerous places and they just bounced back to the way thru were before."
3.0,"The specifications on this was that is was 1.2 inches x 1.3 inches.  This is 2 inches tall and 1 1/4 inches wide.  It is huge and I will probably never wear it except for maybe halloween.  Disappointed to say the least.  It is a nice piece, just not the size I wanted."
3.0,"They‚Äôre pretty decent earrings, no irritations at all. The only thing is they are kind of bulky and thicker than I thought. You can tell from the color and weight that it‚Äôs really cheap but the good thing is that the clasp is really secure. It‚Äôs been over two years and the color became dull, almost silver so if you mind that then I don‚Äôt recommend."
3.0,"I wasn't expecting a product this nice for the price paid.  The tie clips are heavy and appear to be high quality.  My husband was very pleased. These look nice and sleek and I will appreciate the ties not being picked by a teethed clip. Edit: Removed two stars to update review. The problem wasn‚Äôt discovered for a couple weeks, when he found that the back part of the bar isn‚Äôt long enough to reach his shirt placket to clip the tie into place without skewing the tie sideways. Perhaps if one uses very skinny ties the item can be used properly.  Now I must order another type that actually has a clip mechanism like his old one."
3.0,The lense is quite good but the plastic  frame feels so cheap
3.0,"After studying thus maxi dress for months, once the price became more reasonable, I purchased it.  Lands End once had a well-deserved reputation for quality.<br /><br />The print was a little less soft sea glass mosaic and a little more bad neon 60' s decor than depicted.  That may be my eyesight' s fault. However, the pulled threads, uneven not- quite- empire waistline and the distressing spread-gap of the bodice when one changes position makes me regret my purchase.<br /><br />On the plus side, with a strategic safety pin and the constant readjusting of the waist seams, it dies fit flatteringly, falls nicely to the ankle without being too long, and is not too voluminous while still allowing one to walk freely."
3.0,Love the fit but the elastic in the waist twists up and curls!!
3.0,"I purchased these on the recommendation of a technical website - and it is good quality but it is small.  Which is weird since the website review said they were suitable for big faces, but perhaps not for big noses!"
3.0,"good size for my taste (large) nice stone, bright silver"
3.0,When I opened the package and examined the Celtic Cross and noticed the design was only on one side. I did like that it was thicker and larger than the one I purchased at a Renaissance Faire about 10 years ago. The Celtic Cross I purchased at the Faire was pewter also but with a cut out style and a dual sided design but thin. If this cross from Dan Jewelers was dual sided I would have given it a higher rating. I'll still keep it but I am not satisfied with it!
3.0,Great quality but wrong size. I ordered an XS and got an XL.
3.0,"Good fabric, not see through when wet. The cut is not perfect, specially around the chest area, it‚Äôs a little crooked."
3.0,Gift for a teenager and he will probably loose it or destroy it but for $15 who cares.
3.0,Low quality. Ordered an XXL normally wear a medium still pretty tight
3.0,"I would like to give this wallet a 3.75 rating, not quite a 4.  I like the look of the wallet, however there are a few drawbacks:  the pockets that hold the credit cards are a  bit small/ tight making it difficult to insert/remove credit cards.  I am hoping that the pockets will stretch over time.  I transferred my things from a my old wallet, but could not fit all of the things (I could not zip the wallet completely).  I now have a separate coin purse to handle my coins.  I am assuming  the RFID blocking is working, but I have no way of testing that feature."
3.0,I bought these for my 7 year old granddaughter.  They are too big and heavy for her ears.  I will be wearing them..
3.0,"Because of the way tgexaleeves are designed, this dress will be returned. If I hold my arm out you can see clear across my chest."
3.0,"Quality material, not cheap plastic.  But way too expensive for one frame, and it wasn't completely clear until it arrived that it was just the one frame.  Would not recommend for IL plates."
3.0,"While this shoe is beautiful and has drawn many compliments, it is extremely narrow across the widest part of my foot, to the point that it become excruciating to wear them for more than 30 minutes.  I wish I could find it in a Wide option; I would certainly purchase it.  I don't have exceptionally wide feet, either.  I've always worn an 8.5 or 9, depending on the shoe, and have never had to specially get &#34;wide&#34; shoes.  I was very surprised/disappointed at how narrow these were.  I didn't even notice how narrow they were until they were on my feet for about half an hour, and then I became aware of intense pain in my feet."
3.0,"Bought this as a maternity dress and it works well, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much It would shrink when I accidentally put it in the dryer."
3.0,"I love the earring. I have it in my tragus. It looks very pretty and is exactly what i thought it would look like.<br />However, it was very hard to get in because the post did not have a pointed tip. So it was very hard and painful. My ear was tender for a few days. It is fine now and i love it."
3.0,The credit card slots on the side are too small for actual credit cards.....
3.0,Too is not made for larger breasts..
3.0,Print was not visible
3.0,"Purchased this watch for my hubby.  We both are kinda on the fence about it because the face is so  BRIGHT, BRIGHT GREEN one would think it luminous and would light up at night and be good for camping (for example), but oddly in the dark the face shows only dim luminescence.  Go figure.  So, I‚Äôd say for an everyday, going to work watch it‚Äôs probably too weirdly luminescent."
3.0,It is cut to look like the picture the mouth is way far down more around my neck.
3.0,"Straps came apart and felt circles off day 1.  Fixed it all, but c'mon.  1 DAY."
3.0,it kind of roll under
3.0,This skirt is soft and comfortable. The down-side is that it's very static-y and tends to cling to itself.
3.0,WAIST FIT PERFECTLY HOWEVER BUTTOCKS & THIGH AREAS ARE WAY TO BIG..
3.0,"I loved the colors and features, however, they are way too small/short to be useful."
3.0,The material is not as expected. Ordered 2XL which fit well but material too silky
3.0,"Frustrated. They are cute but there are odd numbers of multiple colors, and I‚Äôm missing a lot of colors. Tons of browns and beige, but only one hot pink, one blue, one purple..... no greens at all. Just annoying that I got the most off the colors I did not want"
3.0,"The large fit here isn‚Äôt in width but in length. They‚Äôre too long. The length causes the leg to roll up and bunch where there should be a smooth seamless non-line. I have to wear these with a loose skirt or loose jeans, which is a shame because otherwise they feel good. I know it wouldn‚Äôt work to go down a size because of the way the crotch fits. It‚Äôs just right. Going down a size may slice me in half, and we wouldn‚Äôt want that."
3.0,the more weight i lose the  better it fits
3.0,Good dress and material. But I‚Äôm a tall girl at 6‚Äô1‚Äù 160 lbs....and the measurements would be for a smaller stature woman.  The shoulder straps are in a really odd spot
3.0,"The color here is so great, I just wish the fit was a little tighter in the waist.  I ordered my normal size, medium, and the straps are kind of loose.  The sleeves are right on the edge of being too tight, so I know I couldn't wear a small."
3.0,"Over price here, it's sale on Nike website $20."
3.0,"The neck is WAY too big - and I‚Äôm not positive, but I think the buttons should be on the opposite side. When you roll the neck over, buy-buy buttons. Obviously you can contort so it looks somewhat normal, but please stop making cowl neck sweaters! How about a standard fit 4-5‚Äù tall mock fitted turtle neck. It‚Äôs way more comfortable, flattening AND warm."
3.0,"The opals looked fine, but the gold-plated stud looked very cheap.  I wore them once, and my earlobes didn‚Äôt like them, which made me wonder if they really were gold-plated.  I can wear gold only - everything else infects my earlobes, so these have been put aside.  I wish the settings looked like quality, as the opals look good."
3.0,The leggings were more of a capri length -- did not come close to the ankles; also the ONE (1) pocket that it had was on the waist for extremely small and not very practical -- it was more of a stressed pattern -- not as black or gray background.  The design was cute and they are very comfortable to wear and they do not shrink
3.0,I thought these were supposed to be military laces. Not the case. They‚Äôre similar much much thinner and less ‚Äúrugged.‚Äù
3.0,I'm giving it away to my niece. Won't work for me due to sizing.
3.0,"Odd sizing. The sleeves were very loose like a sweat shirt. The neck connects to the shoulders a little low. This skirt was very nice and charming. If it were just the skirt, I may have kept it. The wait was very flattering."
3.0,"Very cute but very small. Shirt was really short more like a bra and the shorts were very thin material that showed my butt cheeks. If anything I would give it 3 stars, I only made use of the shirt with high waisted jeans, definitely would buy this a size up."
3.0,"Fits great around the ribcage. However, cup size is huge. I'm a size C and it fits more like a large D cup. My breast sinks to the bottom and looks like I'm playing around with my mommy's clothes when wearing it."
3.0,It is seems not night vision. I am looking for more yelllow lens as I used to have one in years ago. Can you send me right one or few that I might will try. Ok?
3.0,"So disappointed. I bought the dalmatian print in medium (I'm a size 8 medium) and it was a little big, but that wasn't my problem...it's NOT a dress!!! Description says it is a dress! It also isn't white and black dalmatian print! It's cream and black! Ew.<br /><br />It's a wrap skirt, although nicely lined, it comes with a separate tank top and doesn't have a split in the front like pics show. There is no spit at all...it looked frumpy! Returning!"
3.0,Bought for my mother and she liked it  BUT:<br /><br />A bit wide (not a big issue)<br />Rather transparent so need to wear something under<br />had a zipper front top instead of buttons ... not her preference<br /><br />On a brighter side it was very comfortable and color looks great.
3.0,It was what I expected from review. I'd never wear this alone. The underarm holes are extremely large and show your bra. But good for under a cutecardigan.
3.0,I ordered mine size medium. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 134 pounds. When I opened my package it looked like at least XL. It‚Äôs very wide. I used belt that came with it and it looked ok. Just a little loose. Waist is a little too high for my taste. I would suggest buying a size smaller. I will probably keep it. It‚Äôs a little too loose but good for casual outings with friends .
3.0,My daughter loves the Wild Kratts so she was happy but it definitely was too big- but she will grow into it
3.0,I'll give it 3 stars because the fabric was nice.  It was way too short when I put it on (I'm 5'6).  It barely covered my stomach.  I really like the pattern and fabric but it did not fit well at all.
3.0,Pendant is beautiful but that chain is junk. Plan on getting a new chain if you purchase this.
3.0,Love love love this dress but the second time I went to wear it I noticed a rip in the seam right in the front of the dress. I'm passed the return window so I can't replace it :(
3.0,"Looks cute but you can definitely tell it's an inexpensive top. The material feels cheap and I'm a little worried the sleeves will tear off at some point this summer. As for fit, I got the M as I'm a size 6 normally, and it's a little boxy. It's mostly comfy, but I could see the sleeves squeezing the arms of somebody who's larger. I have leaner arms and I still had red marks from the elastic after I took the top off, though it didn't really bother me a ton while wearing it. All in all, given the price point, I could have forgiven the material issues and given it 4-5 stars had the fit not been so boxy"
3.0,"There's a difference between ""slim"" fit and ""runs small"". Flattering cut, but size up."
3.0,"Gloves are good quality, but arrived with a hole.  I submitted a return and was promptly refunded.  I'm going to re-order and hope to give this five stars."
3.0,"Update: Seller replaced. I gave my friend the new one, will check back with them in a few days.<br /><br />Disappointed in this locket. Gave as a gift, and was told the first time they wore it, the locket fell off the chain and got lost. Seemed good quality, but not attached well apparently. Wish I could get replaced."
3.0,This mask is probably ok if you do not have asthma or Lung issues. This mask really clings to your face which is extremely uncomfortable. I find myself pulling at it the entire time I have it on. It‚Äôs made well but it‚Äôs not something I can easily tolerate.
3.0,its wide and short - a lot of stretch very roomy lays nice but very short
3.0,I picked a XL and I‚Äôm a medium sized and it‚Äôs still to small
3.0,"Its see through & polyester, but its a little more fitted than some of these & a better cut for a curvy body."
3.0,"Not what I expected. First off, it's rather thin and feels slippery. The white background is not entirely white, it has tiny grey dots/smudges, and the sweater overall looks unkempt, old. The bottom piece and cuffs are tight, but stretchy, might be a good thing for some. All in all, I would say that it's less of a sweater and more of a long sleeve shirt. Returning."
3.0,"theThis top is made of a soft, stretchy material. It is quite thin. and slightly transparent.The top is true to size.  The v neck plunges quite low. I found the neck piece constricting and unflattering. A v neck is universally flattering because it tends to slenderize and elongate. The horizontal choker of fabric makes a harsh, thick, horizontal line. It makes no sense given the bare, summery style. No arm, plunging neckline and then a stupid wrap of fabric around the neck. Seems decently made and the fabric is nice. Easy care, machine wash."
3.0,"The sizing is very wonky on this. Fits 2-3 sizes too small. Nice material, soft and thick, just way too small."
3.0,Once end pieces (aglets) are attached you can not back laces out of holes unless you remove end pieces first. So make sure you have footwear laced the way you want them before attaching end pieces.
3.0,"This card holder is very small and good enough to hold about 10 business cards comfortably and one ID in front of that or one business card in front.  This is stitched well and genuine leather. Mine arrived with two glue or some other stains on it that I was able to mostly wipe off. The front slot has a hole (not a pull tab) that allows one to push the contents up from the bottom.<br /><br />I do not recommend this as a wallet or to hold bills as it is way too small. I do feel the current price of $23.99 is $6 to $9 too much for this since its carrying capacity is limited. Other than this, it is well made and is perfect for business cards."
3.0,It is hard to put on your wrist
3.0,Meh. Cute but cheaply made. Don't expect something to last more than a few months of moderate use.
3.0,The watch is fine but the night light only lights up a corner of the watch. The night light is an important feature for me and it is unusable.
3.0,"I like the material, but can‚Äôt wear it at all. Ordered 2 different dresses based on size chart, thought it fits US standard size, but too small."
3.0,Shape is not flattering at all. Material is a little thick and runs large
3.0,The graphics on this shirt are great. But the cotton material it‚Äôs made of is horrible. Super rough.
3.0,Color was not same as picture. They run large.
3.0,"I usually wear 6.5 but saw other review and ordered half size up which fit just fine.  While the design is very nice, but the Made in China quality with hard leather made my heel get blisters and I will have to put in cushioning pads."
3.0,The glasses overall are nice and very lightweight. My only concern is that they fall off my face. One pair is not as loose as the other but I am having a problem with keeping them on.
3.0,"maybe it's just my petite body, but waist line was not low on me, but at regular waist line."
3.0,"The Color i ordered is more of faded orange/rust than ‚Äúbrick red‚Äù, definitely different than the one pictured.<br />Top seems a little baggier, and fabric is stiff and rough, but all in all for the price it‚Äôs ok."
3.0,"Item arrive fast package seems perfect but one earing and bracelet  had 2 loose diamonds and found 5 diamonds total in bag that they came in, other wise i wore the necklace which was perfect condition"
3.0,"This is the Konfidant, not the Kontra Air."
3.0,I like the packaging. Bracelet is nice.
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but ridiculous small. I always use XL from other vendors and in Amazon I ordered XXL and it didn't fit me, not even close."
3.0,Its far to large to fit in trouser pocket. This is a womens purse.
3.0,"Tight around the hips, otherwise a pretty dress."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it makes me look like a tent. I‚Äôm a size 6, 146lbs for reference. I had to return it. Had I gotten a size down it may have looked better. It‚Äôs very full and flowy. The fabric is good quality and thick/soft. But it fits large to me."
3.0,"I thought this bag was going to be great. It is well made and sturdy. The pockets are great, especially the hidden back pocket. The size was also perfect for me. Unfortunately, the water bottle pockets are way too small. They don't even fit a 16oz bottle. They should've been stretchable mesh. Also, the straps ended up being a pain. I would do the adjustment to shorten the bag, but then that would slide out and they would get uneven. The webbing was also uncomfortable on my bare shoulders when I was hiking. I decided I need more padding on the straps, so I will go with a bag with those big soft rope-type straps instead."
3.0,Comes with ties off. They are long and an awkward addition to the apron base. Only kept it due to wanting a tooth theme for future dentist
3.0,A bit smaller than expected but love it non the less. thank you.
3.0,fits great its just really sheer so wear something under
3.0,"Unfortunately, its damaged. Because it's smocked, it has five pulls, a couple of them very long. Obviously someone returned it and the warehouse put it back without checking it."
3.0,"It‚Äôs a cute outfit, but it runs big. Purchased a 10, and she won‚Äôt be able to wear this until next year, she wears a 8/10!street size"
3.0,"I normally wear a size 12-14, so you would think a X Large would be good, nope. I have a pretty normal chest 38 D, but this dress is so tight on the chest so order at least 2 times what you would normally wear. It is a very cute dress and made out of very nice fabric and flows very nice. I am returning mine and ordering a larger size."
3.0,This dress fit but wasn't as flattering as I hoped. I'm a tad over 5'4 and weigh 125. ordered a small
3.0,Spectacular my necklace but I came without some very sed stones
3.0,buttons popped off after 2 wears
3.0,"I got an XL and while the bottom half fit, it was no where near long enough for my torso."
3.0,I loved these but ended up giving them to a friend with short hair because when I try to tuck my hair behind my ear.. they catch and the back pops right off and they pull out without you noticing. Three times I found one of them in my hair or on the floor... So I gave them away rather than lose them.
3.0,"Got these sunglasses for grandchidren's (ages 7 and 9) baseball.  They don't have enough rubber or whatever on the sides to help them &#34;stick&#34; to the baseball hats. Other than that, they are fine."
3.0,The actual pink color is way lighter than the photo. Returned.
3.0,This nightgown was smaller than the size and measurements indicated.  I've returned it to you.
3.0,"Love the earrings, but they were too heavy for my ears so I returned them."
3.0,"SKIRT IS LOVELY, AS IS ALL YOUR CLOTHING,<br />BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE SKIRT<br />BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY WRINKLES.<br />I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED MERCHANDISE<br />FROM CHICWE, THAT WAS WRINKLED.<br />I HAVE NEVER GIVEN ANY OF YOUR<br />*** STARS, BUT ALL THE WRINKLES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING"
3.0,"Red color is not red. The picture shows maroon, but they are really very pink. Still an okay purchase, nice and long socks"
3.0,"I like the style of the skirt, the only issue think would be is that the waist of it is a little bit tight. You can sit fine in it, it just may be a little uncomfortable after a while."
3.0,"Love it, however it is small, the measurements are correct however one of the photos they have posted with the ‚Äòman‚Äô wearing it must be a child or a very petite man.  This holds my phone and keys, and a small wallet, the pockets are small, so you can‚Äôt really store lots of things as you have to empty it to get anything out of the bottom."
3.0,They are short ankle socks
3.0,The scoop neck is a little low cut and it got a hole it in after one wash/dry :(
3.0,I ordered this dress in blue and sadly it was not the same color as the listing. It fit perfectly and would have been a keeper for sure had it been the color I thought I was going to receive.
3.0,Fits well but I still manage to get sunburned underneath so doesn't do its job 100%.
3.0,Nice but cant sleep in them lol-Alexis
3.0,5'6&#34; 125lbs and fit small
3.0,They are more purplish than the grey that I wanted but not worth sending back.<br /><br />They are also on the small side(almost for kids.) luckily I have small hands and can make them work.
3.0,They said size 42 and I bought them and they were smaller than size 42.
3.0,"The prints started peeling off.  Disappointed.  It looks like it was ironed on, I thought it was embroidered or painted on."
3.0,Bought a medium. Turned out not squat proof for me. Have to to wear beige/nude like underwear so my undies don‚Äôt show.
3.0,"I was disappointed with the Y Stripped Black shirt, it looked more like a man's shirt.  Returning to try another color."
3.0,Tighter than expected!
3.0,While this is a cool shirt - it was tight and not what is usually expected for an extra large shirt.  I am afraid after washing it will be even smaller.  I will make do as long as I can.
3.0,It's really thin and kind of small on my shoulder area... I also ordered a larger size than usual. I don't think it's worth it and I will likely be returning it.
3.0,Very stiff even after washing multiple times but still cute I made it work
3.0,It is very thin and light weight which is nice but may be too thin to be a germ preventer. I bought for my 8 year old and she finds it comfortable and doesn‚Äôt complain so much about it. Fits well on her but still leaves room to grow and stretch so can be used for bigger kids
3.0,"I liked this dress, I would have kept it if it wasn't for a layer of fabric in the chest area that made it look awkward."
3.0,"These PJs were a Christmas gift for my husband. The pants fit fine and my husband likes them. However, the shirt is too small. I would recommend buying them separately."
3.0,Update- I contacted the seller and they refunded me. Thank you for excellent customer service!<br />Love having bifocal sunglasses so I don't have to switch between my readers and sunglasses but the bifocal area is lower and crooked on the left side which makes it hard to focus unless I tip the glasses to the left and then I just look goofy!!! Wish I had noticed that before the return window closed.
3.0,"The shirt itself is very pretty but it runs extremely small.  I normally wear a 1XL/2XL, and I was looking for something oversized and comfy so I purchased this as a 4XL.  The shirt is so small that I can't even fit it on.<br /><br />Before I purchased it I did check the sizing information and pursuant to what is listed the 4XL should've been fine.  Clearly it wasn't, and that's a same because otherwise it is a very nice shirt."
3.0,Love the dress but runs very large. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 125 pounds and I was swimming in the smallest size. Otherwise would have loved the dress
3.0,these might fit small necks perfectly. I'm using each one on the last piece of the chain so sometimes it swings around on my neck and the chain shows.
3.0,"Wish it had actual numerical sizes instead of just small, medium, large, etc. The medium is actually too big for my head, small wasn't available. So, I hope it shrinks, shrinks, shrinks, when I wash it in HOT water and dry it at high heat temperature."
3.0,This item runs rather large. It has great access for nursing and is very comfortable. I found it to be just what i needed coming home from the hospital but once I lost weight forget it.<br />Note that when you wash it the lace does come apart.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this shirt. It looks adorable and the material is soft and slinky.<br />I ordered my usual size (M) and it was too tight around my shoulder blades. I returned it for a large and it was too loose around my torso/waist.<br />Overall, great quality but not for me."
3.0,"It was nice quality and design, but I expected higher quality."
3.0,"good, warm, easy in and out."
3.0,I searched about this I have a small nose and have a earing in it right now waiting for these to get here long wait but I'm hearing its worth it and not worth it but we will have to wait and see
3.0,"I purchased this for my niece, the bracelet is very nice, but it does look a little cheap. The leather braided band had more of a sheen than I expected, and my stones were a little loose, so I'm not sure how long it will last. The magnetic closure is awesome, and I love the color and style."
3.0,"Didn‚Äôt like the fit, returned"
3.0,"Super cute dress but too large. I was bummed because I was happy with the color, design and fabric. I ordered an XS (size 0-2) and it hung on me. Large in the armpit area and too long. Had to return. Very happy with the return process on this item and the quickness of getting my refund. Thanks, Amazon!"
3.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; and this dress only came to my calf. I had to return it because it looked like it shrunk in the wash. The colors are pretty true to the picture ( not vibrant and almost a gray tone  to them) and is a loose fitting dress as described, but if you want a maxi dress, it will only work if you're about 5'2&#34;."
3.0,"Not quite a perfect match,but close enough in color. My original band broke where it connects to the face and I had to get a new one. This one isn't bad, but it keeps opening when I do certain things while my original band always stayed closed. When I put my arm under my pillow or pull up my jeans, it will open. That ismy biggest complaint. I'm just afraid it will open and I will lose my watch one day."
3.0,"This is a gorgeous bag, but it was actually much more gold than it was champagne, which is the color I needed."
3.0,They look cool and fit over my glasses well.  There is a seem at the bridge of my nose that could be a little more comfortable.
3.0,Cute but completely see through.
3.0,"These sack are really cute, but not really comfortable. They also don't stay up very well. The cotton is not soft and the sock stretches out with wear. After a few washes they are actually a little better. Not great, but good enough to keep."
3.0,"Cute and comfy, but material is on the thin side. Would have been a 5 if the material was a better quality. Reminds me of a beach coverup. Definitely not a night out dress"
3.0,Super cute earring design but the small earcuffs look like stainless steel while the crawler hooks look more  like sterling silver hence you cant pair them together. Total bummer for me.
3.0,Too short barley covers my behind. And smells horrible.
3.0,"Super long. I had to cut off 12 inches and rehem. It was big enough around, but the bodice needed to be longer to cover my curves. Instead, the skirt starts too high."
3.0,"Bought these as warmup pants because I needed something to scootch on and off over a swimsuit quickly (before COVID closed my gym again). They'll work for now, and they were cheap, but they feel pretty cheap too - I would not buy these to wear as regular clothing, and they aren't soft enough to recommend as sleepwear. Overall, the knit material feels coarsely woven and overprocessed, and the cut rides low - even though I sized up as others suggested it is a bit snug on my hips and the back gives me borderline plumbers butt (fortunately not so much my tshirt or sweatshirt won't cover it, but definitely getting some late 90s flashback vibes (think: early Brittney Spears era). Otherwise, they aren't totally hideous but I don't think the tapering in the calf is dramatic enough to call these joggers... I'd would call them sweatpants. They're fine for what I need them for, but I'd have gone down a star if I'd had to pay more than $15 for these."
3.0,"Cute - he loved the print - but I'd call these small - they fit my 2.5-year-old quite well, my newly 5-year-old so-so (elastic a bit snug), and my newly 7-year-old not so much. My oldest is in the 50th percentile in all growth categories (height, weight, head) and there just wasn't enough elastic there for him. Even though though the mask covers his mouth, it's pretty tight on his face, meaning that it moves off his nose when he talks and is uncomfortable on his ears. They actually pull his ears forward. I bought three at a time for him since there was a shipping cost, and now I'm wishing I hadn't!"
3.0,Pouch sticks out a lot. Makes your manhood look excited.
3.0,Needs something at bottom to help hold together like a snap or more Velcro
3.0,"I ordered my usual size, medium, and it was too small. Rather than having to make a return, I gave it to my daughter. The colors were pretty."
3.0,Good socks.  These socks feel good after wearing them.  The only issue I have is that they are a little big for me.  It you be nice if they came in different sizes.
3.0,very cheaply made but okay for price
3.0,"This was my 3rd one so I obviously like them. However, this one was sent defective. It was put together wrong and will always be twisted. I am sending it back and hopefully they will be sending me a new one. Pretty watch band otherwise. Oh I had ordered this one because my 2nd one all of the sudden stretched out and would fall off. I think my 1st tarnished and I love how they look new!"
3.0,"the fit or the cut? I'm not sure of how to describe but it was little different than I imagined. the fabric seems cheap. I actually bought the GRACEKARIN one from amazon also just to compare since they both had a same picture but different price. basically you get what you paid for. considering about the urgency of myself needing black pants for an event, I owe amazon prime for their fast service.<br />oh and if you are curious, I kept the other one and gave this JAYHOUSE one to my mom since we both attended the same event, we both needed black pants"
3.0,Love it will buy another
3.0,"Fits, but is quite short. I usually wear an xl in amreican sizes. However, the quality is not good I have this in mint and in black and the stiching has had to be fixed on both of them. Very cute though and I wear them often, with shorts under."
3.0,It looks sorta like the picture. It‚Äôs metallic. There‚Äôs no stone or anything. It‚Äôs cheap material. Probably will only get one wear
3.0,"It does the job but because of its &#34;one size fits all&#34; size, it is just a large piece of unmoldable plastic that won't air against your arm"
3.0,These were weirdly made. Not for me.
3.0,Way too big.  Small is like a large.
3.0,Washed one time and shrunk.  Ok to wear but not the fit and finish I expected.  Too Short now.
3.0,"Cat lovers. Ordered small.<br />Shorts are perfect. Shirt is to short, runs small."
3.0,Even the sm/med is to big for my head
3.0,"Loved the costume but forgot the belt. Thin enough I'm not sweating, but still doesn't fall apart when used."
3.0,I gave them as a gift
3.0,"It was a pretty dress, it just didn't look right on me. Made me look a little frumpy. Would look great on tall and skinny. That is not me."
3.0,"The arms ripped open when I tried it on.  I didn‚Äôt realize that the sleeves would be so narrow.  It is decent quality, however, just has some tears in the arms now."
3.0,Too big around the shoulders.  I couldn't hold the top up.  But a very cute suit otherwise.
3.0,"Tiene bastante espacio,muy c√≥modo"
3.0,"I love the size of the glasses and how thin they are inside the case. I put them on the back of my phone and never have to dig for my glasses in my purse. I would have given it a 5, but the nose grip is plastic and painful. They need to be rubber or something other than plastic grips."
3.0,"Colors are great, but the sizing is quite off. I guess better bigger than smaller. At least he can grow into it, pending he‚Äôs still into the flash in a year or two ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3.0,I have order Medium Size. It fit to small
3.0,After only 1 hour of regular use the toe hook part came off. I had to sew them back on. She wasn't doing anything crazy or extreme with them either. Pretty ridiculous.  But that so far is my only complaint.
3.0,"its a little tricky to put on and doesn't sit on top of my ear like pictured, more like the body stays behind my ear and the face, tail, and leg grips the front."
3.0,I actually returned the jacket. It wasnt as warm as I needed. I loved the color and it fit perfectly. Its warm enough for a cool winter day...35¬∞ or so. I needed it for 15¬∞ to 30...
3.0,They met my son expectation
3.0,"Okay hat, but too small for my husband. The hat does not have any &#34;give,&#34; so it cannot stretch a little bigger, and it will not stay on top of a head that is too big."
3.0,One size fits all but not too generous for the full-size figure.
3.0,They worked well but the UV coating isn't very durable.  Scratches easily.
3.0,"Not a huge fan of these shorts.  There is no front pockets, and the rear pocket is a zipper close and is just odd to use.  The underwear is uncomfortable and made me feel like I had a loaded diaper on.  I don't ride bikes so maybe these work well for that activity.  The shorts did fit well as did the underwear.  THey washed fine and no issues with shrinkage.  Maybe these would work better for bikers but they just didn't work for me."
3.0,To hard to get on and off
3.0,These are OK but I was expecting something a little more &#34;dressier&#34; than they are. Backs are loose so you may have to buy extra.
3.0,"I gave this item three stars because it is lightweight and it did the job of carrying my passport, cash and emergency credit card, but IT IS NOT WATER RESISTANT!!!!  Thankfully, I had the foresight to place most of the inner contents in plastic snack bags and lock my passport away once I no longer needed it.  I also placed my cell phone in a separately purchased waterproof case.  Otherwise, I would have had a disaster on my hands.<br /><br />The cash that I folded and placed in one of the zipped pockets was soaked after minimal water exposure.  It served it's purpose, but I would have liked slots for credit cards.  I also worried about how much RFID protection I had after the water incident.  If I had to do it again, I would pay more for a better product."
3.0,They don't seem to be polarized during sunshineweather
3.0,I loved these pants when I got them.  They fit well and looked great for work.  But one trip through the wash cycle and these look like they belong to my size 4 daughter.
3.0,Very pretty but way too small for my head
3.0,"The headbands are all different sizes. Some fit my daughter and others fit her tight that I can't put on her because they leave a mark. They are cute but if they made them a reasonable size, they would be awesome"
3.0,Oddly sized. Somehow manages to be too big and too small at the same time. Love the print though
3.0,"It's a decent watch. I like the white face, but the hands are pretty thin and sometimes difficult to see against the bright white. The leather is a little cheap, but not uncomfortable. Keeps time well, but the knob feels very cheap and I am concerned about the longevity after a couple time zone changes or a couple daylight savings time adjustments."
3.0,The looks and image are great but the mask is not doubled and has no liner. Durability may be a factor.I would not buy again.
3.0,Muy bonito pero la talla es m√°s peque√±a de lo esperaba
3.0,"I loved the color and material but the pants are really, really short. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 118lbs - the length would of barely looked normal in a flat shoe (I wouldn‚Äôt wear this style with a flat shoe) and the waist was very tight."
3.0,"I would order a size larger than your normal size.  It is a very thin fabric, but came exactly as it looks in the photo.  If you're curvy probably don't bother."
3.0,I love these. They are beautiful. The only reason I gave it a 3/5 is because I was missing one. I have a 1/2a pair of starry night plugs.
3.0,"It's pretty cheap looking but ok, I will wear it with casual summer clothing."
3.0,"I have medium to wide-ish feet.  These sandals are cute, but are very wide.  They do not fit my feet snuggly, and feel like they could fall off."
3.0,Very cute. Disappointed it was way too big for a child and not adjustable!
3.0,"These shoes are so attractive, however they are extremely narrow.  I wear a size 8-8 1/2, got these in an 8 1/2 are they're still very tight and narrow for my foot.  If you choose to buy these, I strongly suggest opting for a wide or a larger size."
3.0,"Pants could not even reach my waistline! Had to cut pants apart and sew into different pants to fit , pants had no stretch !"
3.0,If you lose or damage your sunglasses as much as I do then these are perfect. Somewhat cheap looking and came bent.
3.0,It‚Äôs actually a nice hoodie but does run very small
3.0,"Dress fits as expected, but material is a bit cheap. Then again, what would you expect for the price?"
3.0,This arrived super quick! Quality is ok and fit is a bit small. It‚Äôll work on those lounging around the house and I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs around days. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,Shirt fit way smaller than shorts did. I am a genuine athletic fit and this was real uneven in terms of fitment compared from shirt and shorts to the point I thought it was 2 sizes difference
3.0,The smallest size was big for my wife so we had to return it. She‚Äôs 5‚Äô tall and about 110lbs.
3.0,I dont like the fabric
3.0,color and fitting of the dress is great however the knot is totally useless (its not like shown in pictures)
3.0,It is not Ekouaer. Heavier material that expected. Cute though.
3.0,"I ordered up for the baggy fit of the model and because my top is bigger than my bottom. Unfortunately, in this case, it meant my bottom was swimming and my top was a tad tight. Not the look of the model. Additionally, the grey strip across the chest is higher than my chest and makes them look saggy.<br />Despite all this, I plan to keep this as a lounge around the house outfit because the fabric is so soft and lightweight. Will be great this winter when I'm stuck inside."
3.0,The quality of this wallet is great it's just too damn big. Wouldn't recommend if normal size wallets is what you're used to.
3.0,Seams come apart with first wearing. Poor craftsmanship.
3.0,I liked them but two of the 3 masks straps broke within an hour or so of wearing them.
3.0,"The material of the dress constantly rides up. Wore it to work with a blazer and it would start at my knees and by the time I went up the hallway, the dress was up my thighs. Great, vibrant colors though. I'll just have to wear it as a top."
3.0,I love the detail in this ring. It is rather bulky. I also doubt the validity of it being sterling silver. It turned my finger green within an hour. Normal sterling silver never does that.  It is a beautiful ring tho.
3.0,I don‚Äôt like how the image shows a belt but there‚Äôs no belt just a shirt and pants and two shoulder pieces
3.0,There is less space than I expected. Very stylish and everything else seems nice but unfortunately does not hold a lot of clothes.
3.0,They are cute. Nothing special. They could have a clearer picture. They are sort of hard to see detail.
3.0,"These pants are cut extremely short.  I ordered extra large, and the leg length falls several inches above my ankle.  I use them around the house.  I'd never wear them in public.  Very disappointed."
3.0,"I like the charm, but the wires are too long for that size of charm."
3.0,"Look so pretty. Dropped one on the floor once a few hours after I wore them for the first time and one of the little pink squares fell off, but I accidentally ordered two and when I requested a return I was advised it wasn't worth the shipping cost, so I have a spare."
3.0,Very tiny. Hard to put back on the earrings.
3.0,"Love love this sun dress ,pretty color gold,hope to purchase more colors in that style. Can also wear with a jacket or sweater, seasonal"
3.0,"Please be aware that these shoe sizes run small when compared to U.S. sizes.  My daughter comfortably wears a size 2 U.S. Girls.  I ordered a size 2 and they were at least 2 - 3 sizes too small.  It's nice that the return is troublesome free.  I will give a size 4 or 5 a try because the shoe is just darling.  Looks exactly as pictured and appears to be of a decent quality.  Overall, I am going to give it 3 stars since the sizing is off by a lot...but, if I were to submit a review separately for the look of the shoe, I would rate it 5 stars.  If I were to rate the quality separately, I would also rate it a 4."
3.0,Cute top but def loose fit on top gave me a side boob action. I got a small and I‚Äôm a 34. Think an extra small would‚Äôve it just perfect
3.0,Mas grande de lo que en realidad pense
3.0,seems that the power is off I have other 2.5 these are not as strong ?
3.0,I used this product for hiking and I would not recommend it. However this product is good for if you are going for a run. I took them with me when I went hiking and they did not hold up.
3.0,Really sheer. I was expecting the material to be of better quality. Still very pretty on.
3.0,"I am 170, 5'4 , and I wear medium/large. Jeans size 8-10.  I bought a large and it does not EVEN WRAP. NOT EVEN HALF WAY. beautiful dress but does not fit.  I would have to order an XXL or something."
3.0,Very pretty. A bit heavy but doable .<br />Received lots of compliments.
3.0,My daughter wanted these 5‚Äô4 155lbs she‚Äôs a medium/large in everything else and according to the size chart should have been a large but these were huge! Will try a small
3.0,This studs are a cute little touch for anyone with an ear piercing. Now they aren't real and aren't the best quality but if you don't mind wearing fake jewelry then this is great! Like I said they are cute and add a nice little blingy touch!
3.0,There‚Äôs such a thing as too cheap. This barebones watch is too minimal and the functionality suffers:<br />G shock / Indiglo loyalists will find the built in light useless.<br />Buttons are poorly assigned.
3.0,Love the top but disappointed as xlarge is way too big and its not ordered any smaller.
3.0,I love the sweater but it's about 2 sizes smaller so order big!
3.0,"Kind of deceiving on the pink lense pair, picture shows pink transparent lense, but when the pair arrived the lense is a mirror finish with a very slight pink tint."
3.0,"I purchased two pair, this one however, is a little short did not reach my knees. I am 5'7&#34; and the other pair fit perfectly."
3.0,The black one didn't have a hinge. Went to open it to put it in & the whole piece came out. There's no way with how small it is for me to put it in & wedge the piece back together. The gold & silver both work fine.
3.0,"The dye job is bad. I order the red one, the dress is very pretty. However, the liner is botch with larger red dye spots and is made thin."
3.0,"Very comfy, but I had to sew an extra button in at the top. Way too low cut- much lower than what the photo shows!"
3.0,"Alright i got this mask about a week before i was supposed to get it so that's good but it came in a paper like packaging, not in a box. I was a bit surprised when i opened it cause i wasnt expecting it to be the mask but let me get back on track. The mask came in all deformed on the right side of it, im sure it wasn't shipped like that so im not complaining about the company but i was hoping it would be the same as pictured. Moving on one thing that was the company's fault was left over elevated circles inside the mask, i had to use my pocket knife to get rid of them, its really nothing but still. I am overall glad i ordered the mask but irritated it came in the shape it did with the circles. Could have been better but could have gone worse"
3.0,Cute and feel nice but way too big for almost 5 year old‚Äôs feet (we ordered size 4-6 years old). The socks were just a tiny bit small for my adult size 7 feet
3.0,"Kinda cheaply, very thin."
3.0,"I like it ,very nice"
3.0,Size runs very small ordered a medium should have gotten a XL.
3.0,"Beautiful color... definitely got what I paid for, but they still serve their purpose well."
3.0,"Wonderful suit, but as others have stated, it is odd fitting. I ordered the size 10, which is about on par for what I wear. The bottom fit well but the top was huge for my size 36B chest. The elastic didn‚Äôt even expand :-(. I‚Äôm gonna try a smaller size and see what happens because it is such a cute suit!"
3.0,Not as blousy a fit as I expected.  These companies really need to put a proper size on their models so you can see true fit.
3.0,"Sleeves aren't form fitting, more loose<br /><br />Color is lighter brown than pictured<br /><br />Overall decent product though"
3.0,They fog! Hurt after an hour on my head.
3.0,"Fits amazing at the hips.. absolutely no room for boobs. Seriously...no room. Other than that, it's stretchy and a good fit. Order a size or two up"
3.0,I ordered a size larger but it was still to small.
3.0,I thought the bead size was larger. 8 inches is big for a small wrist. May be returning it.
3.0,"Tight fit, otherwise cute"
3.0,A husky cut pant. Would fit shorter and average/husky kids. Mine is very thin and tall (3ft 25lbs) made for an odd fit. The fabric was also thicker then I was expecting. I will be returning.
3.0,Very beautiful but is not a very strong chain. Caught on my hair and broke two links 2 days after receiving it. Very disappointed.
3.0,Cute shoes but were big. I normally wear a size 8 or 8.5. Ordered white patent in size 8 but returned them because they were too big even with inserts.
3.0,meh!
3.0,"I ordered this dress in the olive and red color. The sizing is right, but the material is thin and cheap. I was kind of disappointed. Since it is thin material, it clings to the wrong places on my body. Might be good to layer with a cardigan though."
3.0,Meh- They won't last long. Hoping they will surprise me and hold together for my whole trip. If they do hold I will come back with an update.
3.0,Smaller than expected. Cute. Keeping to wear at home. To short and low cut for public.
3.0,"these things only worked for one wearing...and when i used them on curved earring posts, they split in half ..."
3.0,Size up at least one size. I‚Äôm a 36D and the large was much too tightüòî
3.0,Would recommend cuz badass overall
3.0,"I wish the shoulder straps were actually adjustable - I don't really think 2 lengths counts. If they were truly adjustable this would be a 5 star product, but to have to choose between arm strangulation and the early 2000's butt-length fashion isn't really for me."
3.0,They weren‚Äôt as baggy as i would have liked i followed the sizing guide and ordered a size up.
3.0,Smaller than expected. Doesn't fit around his wrist.
3.0,Top was too large and stretched out
3.0,I thought it would be heavier than it is.  After wearing the necklace I was satisfied.
3.0,Colors nice but size is too small.
3.0,Ball measured 3mm; not 5mm as stated. Will be keeping because they have nice clasps!
3.0,"A little big if you have thin/small feet, but very pretty"
3.0,Very nice watch but difficult to program
3.0,I love the shape of this dress and the way it falls. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9.5‚Äù and 270lbs and it‚Äôs the perfect length for me but the thinness of the material makes it unwearable because you can see every detail when I start moving in the dress. Underwear lines and cottage cheese. If they had just added a slip under it or made the material a little less thin then this would have been a 10/10 for me but I can‚Äôt justify paying $30 for this thin material when I can go to Nordstrom Rack and find higher quality for a similar price. I don‚Äôt mind paying more money for quality but this isn‚Äôt quality so I will unfortunately have to return
3.0,"Bottoms look weird on, not very flattering.  I still wear the top but with different bottoms."
3.0,I love it but it‚Äôs not long like the photo so lost stars for that for sure I wanted a long robe.
3.0,For some reason this particular color fits tighter and shorter then the other colors of this same brand. Other than that it was good quality.
3.0,Not enough support for people on the smaller size. The only choice to purchase is S/M or L/XL.
3.0,I like the color and the boot is leather
3.0,"The toes dig into you when you do certain poses, and it can be quite uncomfortable. The grips are nice, they give you added support even if you aren't using a yoga mat."
3.0,"This bra runs small, I was busting out the top."
3.0,They fit a child‚Äôs hand up to about six or seven.  They were pretty
3.0,"I have a 29 in underbust, a 27.5 in waist, and 35 in hips. According to the chart, this should have fit perfectly. When I say I was 'sausaged' into this to try it on is an understatement. I have worn legitimate waist training corsets for years for costume, re-enactment, and waist training purpose. I know what I'm doing and sadly the laces in the back were almost as open as they could go. I give this 3 stars for the quality and craftsmanship only. But I would say the size chart is incredibly off. Disappointed I can't wear it. I don't even know what size would fit if the 28-29 inch waist wouldn't fit in someone with a 27.5 inch waist by a LONG SHOT. Will be returning ASAP."
3.0,Cheap material but cute. Very staticky
3.0,It's a good fabric and looks cute. I am a tad under 5'8 and this does not cover my butt. I  keeping it as a tunic shirt.
3.0,Loved them especially for the price. Unfortunately the larger earrings came broken. I realized it too late when I had already warn the other pair and threw out the packaging.
3.0,The size of the band. The face was beautiful but had no screen
3.0,The touchscreen finger tips don‚Äôt work very well.
3.0,"This set of crystals is ok, but they are not as pretty as in their pictures. Especially the amethyst cluster is not as good.<br /><br />Note: the pendants do not cord with chains or cord, you have to provide those yourself."
3.0,This didn‚Äôt flatter me. The material didn‚Äôt hide imperfections and it wasn‚Äôt the vintage look I was going for.
3.0,"This covers imperfections nicely, but if you haves a long torso it will be a little short on you. I have a very hard time finding things to fit my torso and this is no exception."
3.0,I bought 2 different colors both in medium but only one fit. The smaller one felt like an extra small and I am unable to wear them. Thank God I only spent $5 each. Wouldnt recommend.
3.0,It was like what I expected. It‚Äôs not shiny gold like the picture. It‚Äôs dull. But heart is pretty and it can a little cheaper for the looks.
3.0,It‚Äôs a lot larger than expected & chain has broken 3 times already :/
3.0,slip it comes with is a joke. too short. otherwise nice dress. don't buy if you have any kind of tummy. must be thin. tummy will fit just not flattering
3.0,The push button to open the latch rattles A LOT. It‚Äôs pretty annoying to me and makes me think this isn‚Äôt built so well. It looks nice but I wouldn‚Äôt buy one of the same again.
3.0,Muy escotado
3.0,"I really like these Rings. The three different colors are really nice. I was afraid it wouldn't fit cause I didn't know my ring size. Turned out I got just a size above what u need, but that isn't an issue cause it fits on my other finger. I am giving it three stars because it irritates my skin. After a week I had a big rash with peeling skin. I see others have had the same experience. Other than that it's a great ring."
3.0,"It's such a cute dress, but definitely runs small. I was considering getting a bigger size but I didnt like how far the lace goes down the back, too revealing for someone as big as me. I would say this runs 1 size smaller than what you normally are"
3.0,To large everywhere else but the hips were relatively tight
3.0,Very pretty. Bought the larger size. Too small for my D cup.
3.0,"Very, very odd fit. My 5 year old is a 4-5t and pretty lean. I ordered the 5t and they are crazy long, like 4 inches too long. Yet the waist is small to where it leaves a little mark around his waist after wearing all day. I know they are compression but the elastic waistband at the top is too tight. Not sure what shape child this could actually fit properly...."
3.0,"Over the last few years I have purchased several Skechers pairs of shoes and flip-flops for both myself and family without complaint.  They have all been very comfortable and and would give all of them 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the Skechers Sargo - Wolters I recently purchased were very uncomfortable.  The Foot Bed is fine, however the top strap has nylon stitching in it that absolutely rubbed my skin raw to the point of being too painful to wear."
3.0,Was best fit I ever had but then week three while swimming nose part broke and that was it.  Not sure why but was upset cause they were best pair I had to date and I followed all care direction
3.0,"Very thin material, and runs smaller. Over all still a great shirt for the price I paid."
3.0,"The straps are not adjustable. The material in between the buttons do not meet so you can see stomach skin. I could also see into the gap where my boob was. The lacey part on the top also sticks out under the armpits. This a super cute shirt out of the box. But it fits weird. I would say it's pretty true to size though. (I'm 5'5"" and 108 pounds and I ordered a small). I am going to return this shirt."
3.0,The character fell off 1 before it was even worn the others came off after a few times of wearing.
3.0,"Cute top and nice fabric but short waisted. I'm 5'5"" 150 lbs 36DD and the large fit okay but have to return because it's shorter than preferred."
3.0,Looks expensive. My only criticism is it is not luminous enough to read in the dark as advertised. This was one of my reasons for selecting this particular brand.
3.0,"I like the hoodie. I'm a size 4 or small, after reading the size chart I decided on a size medium. The hoodie fits a bit snug on the hips, but otherwise it's cute. I recommend getting a size large if you are a curvy person that can wear a size 4-6. Leave the small to the those that are usually a size 2 and have smaller hips."
3.0,Pills in wash. Very little shrinkage
3.0,Bottoms are good....top not for big chested woman.
3.0,"Love the style, very good looking, quality seems fine, nicely packaged. However, this compression level is too much for me.  I need the lower compressi9n level."
3.0,"Good material, not sheer, just wish it had a little more compression in the mid drift."
3.0,It‚Äôs cute but the beads fell off and the yarn bunches up too much even though I only use it as a purse charm
3.0,"Though this is an awesome fashion design, the knotting and twine comes undone within hours of wear."
3.0,This is a cute dress but it's a little big.....wish I would have ordered a medium
3.0,"Just got these in the mail yesterday for my baby girl, who is expected to be here in March. I thought they looked adorable and I wanted to get something girly for her since were gonna wait to pierce her ears. When I got them they were all smooshed in a bag together. I don't know how well it will actually hold on her head when she is finally born and can wear them. I will try to ush them up or I may possiable have to return them."
3.0,"Eh, I turned it into a vest lol"
3.0,A little too big but he won't wear them until July. Probably will fit better by then.
3.0,Would be nice if the piece you push to attach the band wouldn't pop off as you are trying to attach it. Happened 2 times already.
3.0,The posts on the earrings were changing color and made the ears itchy.
3.0,They look great but we're too big.
3.0,"This really is a great blazer. I wear a 40R (US size), and I ordered the Asia Medium+ version, and it fits like a glove. The fabric is very soft, but that is a styling decision, and it works well. The jacket is very trendy, with a slim fit that is not too tight. Why the 3 stars? The problem is that the jacket arrived smelling of a woman's perfume, and I am allergic to such scents. But the fit was so good, I decided to wash it, thus experimenting with the claim that it is hand washable in cold water. It indeed is hand washable, and no dye came out, and it looks the same. The perfume smell is diminished, but not gone entirely. I will try to wear it, and perhaps wash it again. It is not like perfume was sprayed on the jacket. It is more like a woman hugged someone who had the jacket on, and the woman was wearing perfume. Or perhaps the person who packaged it wore perfume. The concentration of perfume is on the upper right shoulder, which is sort of where a woman's head goes when giving a casual hug. I really do not know how the perfume got there. But again, the styling, material, and overall appearance is very great and trendy. I am assuming that my particular jacket is the odd one regarding the perfume, and other jackets will not have the same problem. Also, I REALLY like the H2H company and clothing, and all other stuff I have gotten from them would be five stars. Again, I am hoping the perfume thing is just a fluke with this one jacket."
3.0,"These were not what I expected. I bought them to wear to work. They look like linen pants in the photos. When they showed up, they were a nylon/polyester blend and felt like pj pants or lounge pants."
3.0,Was super excited for these. They looked super nice out of the package and were really comfy. Did some jumping jacks though and my boobs went flying. Probably good for yoga but not cardio
