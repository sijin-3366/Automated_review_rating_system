rating,review
4.0,"Good room in pockets for keys, wallet & such. Little tight in the legs but should loosen up a bit with a few wears & washings."
4.0,"Not as large or sturdy as they appear, but,for the price, they’ll suffice ~"
4.0,The husband liked this shirt. Be careful for shrinking in the wash.
4.0,"I do not normally give ratings, but this watch, is amazing for the price, keeps time well, have had no issues with anything. It has an elegant look to it."
4.0,"Kinda ugly, but good for biking/ running."
4.0,Gave this to my sister as a gift.  She loves how they fit just right.
4.0,Gift for my friend's teen age daughter she loved it.
4.0,I have a short torso and my bum starts pretty high and it didn't budge out . :)
4.0,Comfortable. I am an American woman. 5'3&#34;. 135lbs. The XXL fit well. The text is incomprehensible.  Whatever.
4.0,"Little too thin, but my fault for not reading the detention . it would've been helpful if the picture has some next to it so it can be compred. Overall not bad for the money."
4.0,like!!!!
4.0,Very pretty dress. Would have given it 5 stars but it was too small and has absolutely no stretch to it. I'm just too thick for it and that's not the dresses fault lol
4.0,Super cute!! Perfect for Flower Girl
4.0,Tight around hips. Otherwise the fit is good.
4.0,"Like it as is and hoping it will wash well.  Love this shirt, highly recommend."
4.0,Smaller then I thought. Needs a much bigger chain.
4.0,It is a nice piece of jewelry that will never tarnish or fade! I’ll have this for many years and it’s not even gold or silver... plain old stainless steel. Nobody knows any different!
4.0,Very comfortable.  Sizing was perfect.
4.0,"Item is extremely cute, im giving it a 4 because its not as thick as i thought it would be. I wear a sz L and ordered a 3xl, it fits like a large."
4.0,Gorgeous dress. Good material.
4.0,"They are functional and look good.  Don't handle them too roughly, though.  Enjoy,  as I do!"
4.0,Band is comfortable. Does stretch with wear but adjustable.
4.0,"Asian Fit. Well made. Cute. This fits a 120lb 5' child as a 2x. It's still long in sleeve but this is not largely swimming on her. It's comfortably sized on her. (If it's important, we don't do tight clothing so baggy or loose is normal.) Definitely not for anyone beyond 5'6&#34; or 150 lbs. or it will be snug and tight. &#60;Something to consider. Wearing this in a coastal community. She said she's warmly bundled on these rainy, cold days."
4.0,"Belt fit, but I had hoped it might be a shade longer than needed.  Even us octagenarians are still ""growing"" boys."
4.0,This has worked well for my husband who has an arm injury.  It's soft fabric and has held up well through many washings.  It's easy to put on and take off with all the snaps.
4.0,These were for myself. I would have liked it better if they came with a case that would protect them.
4.0,"Like the color, Seem to fit well over my glasses"
4.0,"Nice, thin wallet. I do wish the outer pocket was a little more tight as i can stuff a few cards in and now they just kinda fall out if its pointed down.<br />Smells nice<br />cards in the 3 little slots are really stuck in there. i mean you could shower it with lube and they probably wouldnt come out."
4.0,"Fit true to size. Super cute, some of the stitching was coming undone, other than that was happy"
4.0,I thought it would fit a little loose but it was form fitting so order up if you want it to look like the picture. However it is a very cute and well made shirt!
4.0,"These are surprisingly light, but show on the ear!  These are rose gold over silver and well made..no burrs on any edges.  Fairly long but not to an extreme at all"
4.0,I like these even though I did not receive exactly what is pictured.  They look cute on and they all fit fine except for one of them is fairly tight on my neck....which is a normal size neck lol.
4.0,"Love them, wish the lenses were a little darker but they are ok."
4.0,"This bag just the right size to carry around more than just your daily thing,.....very happy with the purchase,hope it lasts more than one season"
4.0,It was a little smaller than expected but it actually Fits a lot better very warm
4.0,"Order either true to size or 1 size smaller. Fits loose, but it's super cute with a belt around the waist. I love how low cut the arm holes are. It looks great with a lacey bralet"
4.0,"It’s cute, a bit big but mostly my fault because I was afraid it would be to small so sized up. The fabric feels good but it has wrinkles that didn’t wash out, and I am not a fan of having to iron."
4.0,"This is a really nice looking belt, but it runs really small. I ordered a 38, which should have fit my husband. I reordered in a 42. I hope that isn't too big, but I was afraid a 40 still wouldn't be big enough based on what the 38 was like."
4.0,These are great for keeping little hands warm and are very easy to put on!
4.0,Looks good..the only thing is the links connecting the leaf to the chain feels a little flimsy but love overrall
4.0,my 6 year old loves it.
4.0,"This fits well and it really pretty! It would work well, for most body types, with the chest being the exception. It isn't for small chests. The color is really pretty, and the length is great."
4.0,Good quality.  Easy to attach to my Fitbit. It's a little stiff but that will change with time I'm sure. Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,Beautiful dress this dress runs long  I really enjoyed that because I’m 5’11”.
4.0,"I read a lot more negative than positive but for $10 why not take a shot in the dark?<br />I'm 5'9, 130 lbs and very disproportionate. I read about sizing problems, cheap material and just all around bad product.<br />Psh. I must say the material is softer than most bathing suits I've owned before, I ordered a size up (medium) despite the fact I'm still in junior xtra smalls. Great decision. This bathing suit is so comfortable, I've been wearing it around the house for a few hours now. The medium is only a smidge small. I have a rather decent sized butt and plump boobs (more cushion on the sides if you get me) I do wish the coverage was a bit better as I had to tuck the ladies back in but all around, I do not regret my decision. My only real complaint is the padding. It's the equivalent to paper. Won't cover &#34;cold times&#34; and for claiming to be a push up it was very disappointing. Also, do have patience for the waist strap, it gets really weird and a disclaimer, the only reason my boobs look that good is because I myself put extra padding in mainly for support"
4.0,"Bigger than i expected, the dots are painted on kinda eh and the side of one of the mushrooms has a weird edge on it. Still like it."
4.0,"I loved this dress! The lace is silky soft, the color, beautiful. The first one I got was too small; No problem exchanging it - the company was very good about it. Unfortunately, the next one zipped up, but the top was much too big! I'm just not a slim pencil shape, more like a juicy apple. The four stars is because, sadly, I had to return it, otherwise, it would definitely be 5."
4.0,"Like most Shimano shoes I have tried, this runs a size small, I uaually wear 10.5E and needed size 46. The front of my feet do not feel too tight despite my wide feet, which is a problem when wearing other brands. My other pair is the Shimano SH-XC31, which is stiffer, but the soles are too hard and do not grip as well as this pair when walking offroad. Being less stiff does make pedaling less efficient. I do walk my bike quite a bit offroad, and these shoes are fairly comfortable for doing so."
4.0,Its comfy
4.0,I love the color and comfort of this<br />This product. But unfortunately it now snags on my clothes and messes them up.
4.0,The charm came in beautifully. It is a little lighter in weight then I was expecting.  But the charm is dazzeling none the less.
4.0,More of a bright coral than a subtle blush color but still very flattering!
4.0,"looks great. not as nice as the original, but works."
4.0,Great umbrella bit base could be heavier so it doesn’t blow away
4.0,"Not as blue as shown, more of a blue-gray but looks ok with denim which was what I was looking for.  Socks themselves are very soft and comfy."
4.0,"The Belt is a little long, but other than that, the dress fits amazingly. I'm 5'6&#34;, ordered a small, it comes just down to my knees. :) Definitely looking into ordering another color."
4.0,"Decent quality for what you pay for. It is light weight and flowy, very feminine and flattering."
4.0,The dress is very cool but the size is not for me I wear a XL and this is too short and too close fitting for me
4.0,Great wrist wallet!  It is a great length and thin so it is easy to throw in bookbag or carry in hand.  The only bad thing for me is it is so thin when I add my money and cards my lip gloss won't fit to zip up.  So of course no phone can fit.  But as far as cards and money and a light weight wrist purse this is a really nice option.
4.0,Durable and has a great looking blue paint job.  The only thing is that the paint started peeling off the second I took it out of the box.  But its a shoe horn right? No big deal.
4.0,Hangs too low in front even when balance of sizing is correct
4.0,"Looks great, just a little tight in the chest area."
4.0,I'm a little busty so the waistline is a little higher than expected.  I think I can make it work but I'm still deciding if I'll keep it.
4.0,"This is a very cute suit. The material is very silky and stretchy. The chest pads come out easily if you don't want them in.<br /><br />I was not sure if this was made in China or not so I wasn't sure what size to get. When clothing is made in China people say to get a size bigger so I did just in case. I am a medium and I ordered a large. It fits fine. It ships from America quickly, but the tag says China.<br /><br />I have not worn it swimming yet, but I am worried that the top part might come up over my head. I purchased this because I liked that the bottom was not attached, but I assumed it would be more secure around the chest area. I did order a size larger than usual, but even if I didn't I'm sure I'd have the same worry because of how the suit is made. That is my only complaint. Maybe it will work out fine."
4.0,I have somewhat thicker calves.
4.0,The back is very loose fitting and drapes down my back but it is gorgeous!
4.0,Thought this would be flat  but is a loop. Quailty made...will try to make it work
4.0,"These are nice top and fit as i was expecting the only reason i give 4 stars is because there were 2 isuess, one is the black one was way too big the tag shows is small but it is like a large or extra large so not problem to me because i can give it to my niece she is big. Second, the colors are not like the picture only the black one and kaki but the red one is more like a wine color and blue one it is navy blue so dont expect the colors as they showing it. By the way they're nice blouses for a casual outfit, comfortable, and stretchy"
4.0,"I like this, the fabric is nice enough, very comfortable. I was expecting something more silky and this has that quality but is heavier than I was hoping for so it doesn't move as nicely as real silk or satin would. Otherwise it works for most of what I wanted it for."
4.0,The beads are a true blue color without brown tones.  I purchased to wear as a bracelet but it would also be a nice necklace.  The stones are nice with no beads that I can see.  The price is reasonable for the quality.  It is difficult to find jewelry in the true blue tones like this so this is a win.
4.0,I love the cut.  I wear this with printed leggings and jeggings.  Easy care and great comfort.  Material is thin.  I have to wear a cami under for modesty.
4.0,A little long for my taste. So I gave it to my mom.
4.0,I am a bustier woman so shirts can fit me weird. This shirt fits very well and is flattering. I deducted 1 star because it is rather see through. I will just layer a white tank underneath.
4.0,"Such a beautiful dress! Great for home, office or events. The lace is delicate and dress is elegant. Definitely runs bigger and I’d recommend wearing dark garments under as it’s a bit transparent. But even with that it’s gorgeous on. The XS is more like a size S or even a M, but still beautiful."
4.0,"Great as a carryon, doesn’t hold a lot. Good for your meds and small size electronics."
4.0,Fits as a six as described in comments. I am between a five and three so if u run with them on they will fall off
4.0,"they looked good . but my grandbaby is too light to make them work right  hopefully they wear in and work better for her, she has to stomp hard to get them to work . so time will tell"
4.0,"I like it. It’s different but not in an obvious way. People comment on how pretty and stylish it is, then look closer and are intrigued buy how it works. Good price for a casual, everyday watch. Nice addition to the collection."
4.0,"Nice colors, they hold the mi band secure."
4.0,This product is beautiful for it’s price but every time I put them on the glasses shift to my left side a bit and I can’t adjust them
4.0,"They are ok.  just fit a little differently than my shorts that I have been wearing.  If I lost some weight, I'm sure that would change the feel of the fit. They are well made. No complaints on workmanship."
4.0,"Had to adjust the opening with jewelry pliers, but once I did they did not fall out. The metal appears to be coated, as the process of adjusting marred the coating a bit. Also one of the rings came missing a stone. Overall a good value for the price, the stones are actually sparkly and don’t look cheap, and they are comfortable to wear once you finagle the closure to the point that works for you. I could not adjust these by hand as the metal is not very pliable, hence using pliers."
4.0,Seemed like they had already been worn.  No tags and had some pilling.  But very comfy!
4.0,"I buy direct from China so I knew what expect.  They are cute shoes, but won’t hold up to toddler wear and tear if worn daily.  They run a little big, but nothing a thicker sock can’t fix."
4.0,color is only one-sided but it fits well on adult and the fabric flows well
4.0,Purse is what I expected and arrived on time!
4.0,"I do not normally wear dresses, but I purchased this for my Louise Belcher (from Bob's Burgers) costume for Halloween. It fit well, the fabric is soft, it was not too baggy or tight, and not too pricey. I ordered an XL: I am 5'7&#34; and about 170 lbs. The dress was shipped quickly and was as described when I opened it. No complaints and I would order this again in other colors."
4.0,"I LIKE THE COTTONY FEEL AND THE LOOK OF THE YOGA PANTS.  THEY HAVE A HIGHER WAIST WHICH I LIKE. I'VE WORN THEM TO YOGA TWICE BUT HAVEN'T WASHED THEM YET. THEY'RE VERY STRETCHY AND I'M NOT SURE IF THEY ARE GOING TO STRETCH OUT TOO MUCH. SINCE THEY ARE VERY REASONABLY PRICED AND SEEM TO BE WELL MADE,  I THINK THESE PANTS ARE A GOOD PURCHASE."
4.0,"This is a super cute top..however, BEWARE that it is totally see through! I am 5'3 and 125lbs and I ordered the small."
4.0,"The shorts are good. They serve their purpose-padded seat for bicycle riding. They are stretchy and on the thin side (not a heavy duty material) but priced accordingly.  I found the sizing and reviews confusing so I went with my instinct and am glad I ordered two sizes up. My son is an average sized 8 year old (almost 9 yrs. ) who wears size 8 or medium. I bought the size XL and they fit snugly. Good enough to still be comfortable but any smaller and they would not fit around his average sized waist. The online description says the XL is size 8-10 (I disagree-they are more like a sz. 6/7 or 7/8). The actual tag on the shorts just says "" Kids XL"" without a corresponding size number. My son likes them and wears them gladly. They are a good buy as long as you order 1-2 sizes bigger (my son usually wears medium, we ordered extra large)."
4.0,"Good price, good fit, but it’s a little thin and was “pilly” on the fabric surface after the first wash.  Still, I like it and wear it anyway."
4.0,comfortable for wife to lounge in
4.0,Super cute! And it came early! The bra fits good the underwear is a little small but I can still wear them. Over all super happy. Definitely go up a size or two
4.0,"Loved the fit and shape. The tint of the glasses were really over powering and made everything really orange-y, sepia colored. Would have like a more natural look lens."
4.0,Thought it was 100% cotton like it looked on line but its not so its sorta misleading but I'll put it to use for me.
4.0,The red was so tight but the black fit perfectly.
4.0,"Nice piece for the price. Only downs is that I the advert says 10bar water resist, and I got 30m water resist."
4.0,"I love the qaulity, the feel, and the look of these large-size ladie's hosiery dress socks.  I recommend making them a little longer, so when they stretch wider, they do not become too short. Oh and how about a tan color too?"
4.0,I need to wear a tank top under it because I don't like to show my bra in public. It's very comfortable. I ordered a larger size because of reviews and I am glad I did. My husband said it is beautiful on me.
4.0,Good quality and having two colors is nice. Well made.
4.0,"This was perfect for my costume. It’s soft velour on 1 side and the hood totally covers your head. There are 2 ribbons, sewn on, that tie in front. The stitching looks super cheap all around but it’s not that big a deal since this is only worn once a year."
4.0,LOVE have received lots of compliments
4.0,Fits great. A little shorter than I thought but overall great
4.0,These fit really well.  They are not too thin and not too thick.  Just thick enough so they are not see through.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"I've had it with cheap safety glasses with tons of distortion in the lenses.  Regardless of your hobby or work, treat yourself to a pair of decent glasses.  If you commonly wear muffs for hearing protection, these have thin metal bows to fit without breaking the seal.  Without muffs the glasses aren't as secure as I'd like so I took a star off."
4.0,"Nice and warm, but fits a little snug."
4.0,"This bathing suit is cute and flattering. However, the top does expose more than I was wanting it to. So bigger chested women, size up."
4.0,I like it. Not as lightweight as I expected. More for actually keeping warm rather than stylish. Nice though.
4.0,My granddaughter absolutely loves this shoe just wish it would have come in whole size instead of size and a half just a little big !!
4.0,"great material, took advice from other buyers and bought up a size.  didn't need to.  fun shirt, wish the &#34;sparkle&#34; actually sparkled."
4.0,"I like this product. The lanyard is longer than the ones I've purchased in the past, which makes it easier to leave on my neck while unlocking my doors. It seems well constructed. I'll have to wait and see how well it weathers in order to know whether I'd purchase it again or not."
4.0,Like it but don't love it. There is something about the feel of the exterior fabric that is irritating. Guess that is just an old person thing...
4.0,It’s a pretty watch just there’s no way to make it tighter so it’s to big for my mom’s wrist
4.0,hoodie looks perfect and super cute but pants look kinds weird like the way they fit
4.0,"This dress is just beautiful. It will be perfect for warm days. I ordered L because most of these dresses run 2 sizes smaller. Usually I wear small or medium.This is a little more loose than the others I ordered, but the tie  belt will take care of that."
4.0,"After reading reviews, I went with an XL. I have never been an XL; normally, I'm an S. But this seems to run in girls' sizing, because the XL was right. If it shrinks a little after washing, it will be spot-on perfect in sizing. Now, it's just a little boxy, but there's no way an L would have fit. It smells a little funky, but otherwise it's really darling. I'm looking forward to wearing it."
4.0,"I was expecting a faux leather (pleather...plastic/leather, lol) wallet, but was pleased to find that it’s actually canvas. It’s a bit small but for $10.99 it’s pretty great!!"
4.0,Beautiful suit but just a little tight. 5'5 149lbs ordered a medium which would usually fit great. But should have gotten a large
4.0,"Small and dainty, my one problem is that it's hard to reopen, but you get used to it. It's very snug, but I like that look. There's no space from bottom of nose to piecing"
4.0,They are very pretty but they came to me broken and I can't fix them what can we do about this???
4.0,"2nd order, like very much"
4.0,I haven't used these yet but getting ready to go photograph the Big Horn Sheep in Rut in Wyoming this weekend.  The temperature is expected to be before 32 during the day so I am going to put these gloves to the test. They fit nicely and appear to be well made.
4.0,"Nice quality, a little small but that might have been my fault. I kept them because I like them"
4.0,Product changed color in 3 days :(
4.0,"Love the material , although I think the color is a bit off... in person the color is more of a<br />Light pink verses a peachy color.. overall cute little set."
4.0,Very tight fitting but I guess that's the way they should fit.  Beautiful white color.
4.0,"Great for quick wear but don't have your kids walking around for extended periods in them. Our son LOVES his shark sandals and wanted to wear them grocery shopping, bad idea...he got horrible blisters on the inside of his feet at the arches and it took them about 2 weeks to heal. He was probably walking in them for around 30 mins. With that being said he still loves them 😂. Now we let him wear them to go outside to check the mailbox or feed the ducks (we live on a small pond with mallard ducks)"
4.0,The straps stretched out easy but its the perfect little wallet
4.0,They will roll down if not held up with either a garter or with double-stick tape inside.
4.0,Really nice watch for the price u r paying for.
4.0,My niece loves it! Perfect fit and super cute. Would prefer all one color of pink instead of two.
4.0,"Fits true to size. I’m 5’3”, 130lbs. I ordered a small and the dress was touching the floor while barefoot. It would probably just barely skim it with flip flops on. The frabric is soft and sort of slinky. Perfect for spring and summer. My only complaint is that the blue pictured doesn’t quite match the blue I received. What I got was more of a bright sky blue than a periwinkle blue in the photo and I’m not crazy about the shade of blue :(<br />This dress would be perfect as a maternity dress as it allows for growing room in the belly area!"
4.0,"Very comfortable! Pants were a little smaller in the thigh area than expected, but PJ's were very comfortable otherwise. Color was as pictured."
4.0,My daughter is super happy !!!
4.0,Like the style and fit.  Just can be a little difficult getting the face to line up right to pop in
4.0,They are big enough to cover his beard
4.0,"I have a few pregnant friends who have expressed a need for in between clothing.  They are usually smaller than me so I can not give them mine, but they need in between clothing to wear until they begin to show some more.  Their older things don't fit, and they need something that is not falling down.  These are perfect for one of my friends.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />FABRIC<br />These are not cotton.  I got them because they said they were a cotton poly spandex blend.  These are all polyester with a little spandex.  That is frustrating.<br /><br />COLOR<br />I got the dark gray color.  It is a nice heather effect.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The style is adorable.  Really looks good on too.<br /><br />FIT<br />This is a size XL and I got it because a lot of the clothing on here runs smaller.  This will easily fit my friend at a size 12-14 with baby bump (she usually wears a 12) and it has room to stretch for most of the pregnancy.  The legs stretch nicely and are comfortable too.<br /><br />WAIST<br />One problem with some waists is that the pants are fine but the elastic is too firm or small.  This one is PERFECT.  It is firm but stretches without frustration easily.<br /><br />SOFTNESS<br />That is where these are a bit frustrating.  They are not nearly as soft as expected.  They are not bad, but not quite as soft.<br /><br />SHEER?<br />These are a thinner fabric than I usually like, but due to the ribbing effect, they are not quite as see through as others that are smooth knits.  Plan to wear something over these if you dont want to show every line and lump.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These are cute pants.  Even for maternity they work out well.  I am disappointed that these are not cotton, or quite as soft as expected, but they are still wearable and comfortable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  If the fabric had cotton in it and was a tiny bit thicker, they would be perfect."
4.0,"The size 0s flair too much but once they’re in, they don’t rotate much and they look good"
4.0,Looks cool. Snapback so you can adjust to your size. Quality hat.
4.0,It is a gift for an 11 year old. Hope she likes it.  It came on time and it is what I expected.
4.0,"I bought these for my stepdaughter, the large ones, and they are very cute...but also very HEAVY.  I wouldn't buy for fragile lobes!"
4.0,"Definitely a comfortable dress, especially for a pregnant person, but with bigger boobs and a heavier fabric, the v-neck is easily pulled lower than I feel like is shown."
4.0,"Overall the shirt is great. I had DBZ vinyls applied and wear it to yoga. Material is comfortable a cool. I probably could have gone with a smaller size, but it's comfortable. The only reason I'm docking a star is because in the first wash it picked up some link from another article of clothing and about 60% of it would NOT come out with a lint remover. It's like it got interwoven with the fabric."
4.0,A little smaller than I expected but will fit the bracelets I purchased.  These will make great Christmas gifts!
4.0,Me quedaron algo grande. Pero la tela y el grosor muy bueno
4.0,You need to wear dark underthings beneath it. A white bra would definitely show through. My daughter really likes it.
4.0,Little tight but really nice.
4.0,great shirt and thick material. A little to small and thick for me.
4.0,A little heavy in the neck line but will work fine for my needs...does cover quite well...good to have for so many outfits.
4.0,"These ankle boots fit me except for the ankles.  Therefore, the zippers are somewhat difficult to zip up on the outside of the ankles.  I like the boots very much.  I would recommend these for someone who likes a low heel with an outside zipper."
4.0,Very cute slides for the beach. They do run a tad small! Granddaughter loves them.
4.0,wish the color was more Pink.
4.0,Value for comfort
4.0,"Because I am only 5'3&#34; the waist on this apron is way too low for me.  However, the coverage of my whole leg is important, so I'm working around that."
4.0,"They are a little tighter than I expected them to be, maybe because of the lining. I'm hoping they will get &#34;broken in&#34; with more wear."
4.0,"These come down to a what you pay is what you get. Everything about these gloves is &#34;good enough&#34; for the cost. If you just need a pair of white gloves for a costume or to wear for one night, buy these; they'll work out great. If you need them to last longer than a few uses though, invest in a better pair."
4.0,"I do love this towel, but after only a few washes, one of the ears on the panda bear started ripping and I had to sew it back together."
4.0,"Everything was exactly as pictured. It fits well. It's not as flowy as I thought it would be, but the fabric seems to be decent quality.<br />The straps are adjustable. The belt comes is removable.<br />Overall great dress, worked amazing for our engagement photos!"
4.0,It is small and petite. I like it but I was hoping it was a little bit larger. If they would make a larger one I would buy that. I liked it very much.
4.0,"Adorable! But had to return because it's not a ""one size fits all"" sadly."
4.0,I'm planning a trip to Colorado and I think this will keep me comfortably warm.  Again it came very wrinkled though and not sure how to get them out.
4.0,super comfy<br />fit great<br />very cute (I think...).<br />not see through but soft!<br /><br />Wish it had pockets :(
4.0,"Great look,  style and fit. I only wish one were available in real waxed canvas, but this is a good light weight cap."
4.0,Set up super easy!  Super tight for 3- OK for 2
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b9860e5189a8aa5955251465b431b887]] This wallet does exactly what I need it to do.  It holds my iPhone 6 and other necessities. I like that the strap can be placed in two different positions so it can either be worn on my wrist or like a purse, on my shoulder."
4.0,I would recommend sizing up so the bottoms fit since the top is adjustable!
4.0,"These are perfect and sexy if you are very thin.  I am 5'5, 140 pounds and a little curvy.  The top of the pantyhose (where it's suppose to reach under my butt) barely reaches up to my thighs, however, they still look good when I put on a knee length dress."
4.0,fits just right the price was bad for it either.
4.0,Good quality. My daughter loved it
4.0,Very nice  Quite dainty.
4.0,"I decided to only get glasses this year, no contacts. So these goggles are needed while swimming if I want to see. They are great at that! I went for the weaker Rx between both eyes and it’s fine. I can read the clock from the far end of the pool. So far the anti-fog is doing ok. Every now and then it lets in a bit of water. I think the strap mechanisms could be designed better as it’s hard to tighten them with wet hands, but overall, definitely a good purchase."
4.0,"Like it but somewhat too big, I don’t know maybe I lost some weight"
4.0,"I basically love them. They’d rate 5 stars but for the fact that they shrink - not so much that they can’t be worn, but still......"
4.0,It can be a bit of hit of miss ordering clothes on the internet.  I was worried that the knit would be thick and clingy but  was pleasantly surprised the fabric was light and not clingy.  The cut across the stomach is a good one as it hides any lumps you may have.  Sleeves are not full length.  The stripes are fine and at  a distance it looks like bluey grey color. The color will lend itself to a variety of accessories.. I like the V neck. and that it has two darts at the back giving  you some shape. The only thing I didn't like was the longer section  that hangs down but I will investigate if that part can bean altered It will need a slip for it to fall smoothly over the body.  I do lament that manufactures do not line garments.
4.0,Material is a little thin so cannot use on really cold days.
4.0,"Great add to the costume, basically got what I paid for:  hard plastic with 2 part cane the right height, vibrant colors that take a beating"
4.0,Decent quality novelty item has lasted more then I expected<br />Seems the lettering is very durable
4.0,"I really like these slippers.  I wear them inside and outside.  Very comfortable.  Would have like more memory foam to last longer during the day, but it is sufficient."
4.0,"Very cute dress with pockets and empire hem (Blue 1 style)! Fabric was very soft. However, it was too small compared to the picture. I'm 5'7&#34; 173lbs (size 10-12) and the large was a little snug for my liking and it came almost to mid-thigh rather than the top of the knee. The skirt sides come up higher than expected, which makes the dress appear even shorter.  Sizing up would be advised.  I returned the item due to size."
4.0,This one is actually holding up better than a similar one bought from another seller.<br />I use it for hiking and it's fine for that.
4.0,"Ordered an M and an XL because I understood that these would shrink and knew ahead of time that I would be &#34;working&#34; on these to make them long enough to tuck your feet into.<br /><br />Washed both gowns in warm/cold and dried warm/hot to get the most shrinkage before giving either as a gift.<br />The length drew up 2-3 inches from the length out of the package.<br />IMO, no excessive (for 100% cotton flannel) shrinkage otherwise, but you want nightgowns to be &#34;roomy,&#34; so purchase accordingly.<br />I was skeptical about the eyelet being 100% cotton, but I think it may be. It looks good for it. I cannot speak for the thread that is a part of the eyelet, but it seems too shiny for cotton thread. The eyelet is nicer than expected.<br /><br />The medium gown's &#34;sweep&#34; (hemline) measures 54&#34; across (after laundering), and the XL is about three inches wider (about 57&#34;). Compare this with the sweep of your favorite gown. To small a sweep gives you a &#34;hobble&#34; gown and you can trip yourself up in it.<br /><br />The XL's laundered length is about an inch (yes, 1&#34; only) longer than the Medium's laundered length, which is 47&#34; from the nape of the neck to the hem at the back.<br /><br />I am pleased with the weight of these and the fabric so far.<br /><br />To create the length I need for these gifts, I am adding a ruffle in a solid flannel (prelaundered to shrink the fabric before cutting), using a 13&#34; ruffle on the M for a 5'8&#34; lady and a 9&#34; ruffle on the slightly longer XL for a 5'5&#34; lady.<br /><br />The ruffle will be hemmed in the fabric of the original gown.<br /><br />If you decide to go this far to make this gown work, you may want to see Mark Montano's &#34;Make your Mark&#34; sewing video &#34;How to add a ruffle hem&#34; for the principle of adding the ruffle and also have a look at &#34;3 ways to gather&#34; from Threads for the &#34;hard&#34; part. These are both on youtube. I prefer two gathering lines for prettier gathers, the second to sit virtually at the final seam line. For that method, the second video will be helpful."
4.0,"I really love this robe. It’s so pretty! It’s soft and comfortable as well. I have noticed some loose stitches that I will be trimming, but for the price it’s just what I was hoping for! I do wish I ordered one more size up, only because I like the extra room in my robes but it’s true to the size that I ordered so I’m so happy! I’ve always wanted a kimono style robe but they’re so expensive. I’m happy I got to find one that didn’t cost an arm, leg, and kidney lol"
4.0,"This was a decent purchase, I did not have any problems with it."
4.0,"I ordered a little larger (M) than I normally do (XS/S), as I was afraid it would be too tight and I was on an short timeline. I probably could have gone with the small but the medium was just fine with a wide belt around the middle. As other reviewers have noted, the stripes at the side seams don't always match up, but that really didn't bother me, personally. The fabric is solid and slightly shiny and has a good, heavy drape to it. I wore this with a petticoat and it flared out beautifully. I'm not sure I'd necessarily wear it without, given that, since I ordered up, it's a bit less snug than I'd like for that-- with the petticoat and the belt, though, it was extra comfortable. The petticoat did show a bit of the edging, but I wore a contrast color (red) with a matching hat/fascinator and it was perfect. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,I like them but would prefer the top band to be a bit wider.  Fits as expected.
4.0,"Got 1 as a gift and others for myself. Shiny and cute. Thanks, P......:)"
4.0,Such a gorgeous coat. I love it. The fur lines the entire length of the coat! I would say this fits on the small side. I'm petite. 5'4&#34; 120lbs. The small is snug on me.
4.0,"Sizing is huge, returning for a smaller size.  Shirt is great quality and will be very warm."
4.0,Under top with too big of necks
4.0,Love the fit and look. A tad loose in the calf area and long. Great wear with heels but not flats. Maybe will shrink with wash?
4.0,Unusual
4.0,I bought these for mountain biking and especially for the inserts for an Rx. But when I took them to my eye doctor she told me because of astigmatism the insert frames are too curved...just a fair warning. Since I’m getting contacts I will still use the sunglasses so it’s not a total waste. They are very comfortable to wear. I like that the temples are long so they hug your head better.
4.0,"Got these today, tried on, and I really like them. I and 5'3"" and 170 pounds and they fit perfect. The only issue is they are to be short and fit me full length but perfectly. No tight waist or anything. I will be wearing as normal pants. Enjoy!"
4.0,"Hooray! My new favorite shorts! I have trouble finding things that fit comfortably due to body pain, but these are perfect. I'm going to get a couple more pairs. If they were made in the USA from more earth-friendly materials, they'd get 5 stars."
4.0,"From far away it looks high end but up close there is no stitching on the bottom hem. Disappointed. However I have all of the sewing tools (hence my higher rating)  I need to make one myself, would have been nice if I didnt though"
4.0,"Frames are great, arrived quickly. Only problem is that I already have to take them in for repair. One of the nosepad screws popped out and the nosepad came off. I only wear these as a backup to my contacts, so they have not had much wear in a month's time."
4.0,"The fabric is soft and comfortable. I usually wear a small, but after reading reviews, I ordered a medium. It's too baggy. The shoulders are too big. The sleeves rolled up make it too bunched rather than the look in the pics. Overall, I wish I'd ordered a small but I'll keep the medium for a comfy day shirt."
4.0,CHAIN broke almost immediately I put the pendant on a leather cord and its beautiful!
4.0,"This runs a bit big so size down but super comfy! I bought it in black, navy and hunter green. Cute dress to glam up with a jacket and jewelry. I’ve also worn with denim jacket for running errands."
4.0,My husband bought it for himself and he really seems to like it.  He's looking forward to using it when the weather gets warmer
4.0,"The stars are cute and colorful. They are simple but watch out, the tips of the stars are pointy! I found out when I laid down with these on because I forgot I had them on."
4.0,"Another item I got for my hubby. The material is great quality and feels smooth against skin. There is Pro and Cons on his part. A little about him He always on his feet and working with his arms. His arms are big. So they sleeves fit the first part his arm but does not  go all the way up like they should. If top part was a little stretcher they be perfect. It help keep him cool where it did fit, and when he can it on it was comfortable and easy to take off and hand wash. He has told his friends about it.<br />I receive this an a discount price my honest opinion."
4.0,"Runs a little big, but that is fine for working out."
4.0,"These make great back up goggles. They don’t protect against fog completely, but they are good for about half a day of boarding if you don’t take them off or rest them on your hat (where they pick up moisture). I keep them in my backpack when snowboarding or snowmachining and use them if my Smiths get wet."
4.0,Shoes do run a bit snall.
4.0,Stone looks good. They are smaller then I expected.
4.0,"This is a really cute swimsuit. The material is made a little thin so I dont know how well it will hold up in a pool. Its definitely cute enough if you  need a swimsuit to lounge around in poolside, on the beach or on the lake. Fyi the bottoms do cut up high on the sides. *I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review"
4.0,And the shirt is pretty good quality definitely recommend sizing up
4.0,I bought these last year and they were a different material and different cut. These aren't as stretchy as id like. Takes some getting used to at first but they don't bother me anymore. Tighter fitting.
4.0,"A little roomy, but wife says very warm and she's happy with it."
4.0,"I really like mine overall.  I especially like it being slim, but yet has plenty of room in the pockets and slots. It is very comforting to know that my debit cards are secure. My only regret is that it doesn't have a picture holder, but I took mine out of my old wallet and slipped it in one of the larger pockets which works very well. The wallet is well made.  I would definitely buy it again.  Fortunately, I have NOT experienced the annoying crinkly sound or strong odor that was mentioned in other reviews."
4.0,"I love this top! It's pretty, feminine, and good quality. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it runs a little small I think. I ordered an xl (am normally a large) and it fits more like what I expected a medium would. In this case, it still works, it's just quite a bit less blousey on me than it is on the model. I ended up pairing it with a slightly voluminous maxi skirt (which I couldn't have done if it was as blousey as originally expected) and it's super cute. If you are between sizes, I would recommend going up, but I would for sure but this again."
4.0,Great repair for my scratched lenses.
4.0,"fits great, looks great, but the fabric is very delicate."
4.0,"Fits great adjustable straps all around pretty neat i will buy again always getting a new pair for next year. although the velcro wont last more 2 summer,only because the velcro wore thru but for 2 yrs thas pretty good. the rubber bottom made walking nice for shock on knees or feet and so comfortable .as we all swell up towards the end of the day these make it nice."
4.0,Shirt runs bigger
4.0,Runs just a little small (unless  she is lying to me about her size)  lol
4.0,This dress is as described (mostly).  The fit and size are pretty much true to size.  The only thing not mentioned in any review is that the material is more like what a fleece lined legging is like.  It is a soft and buttery shiny polyester with a fleece lining quality on the inside.  It is a very thick and warm dress that may be more suitable for colder climates or situations.  Definitely not a dress for summer heat.
4.0,"Beautiful, very warm. Unfortunately it's packed so tight in a package that it is extremely wrinkled. (In the picture  that is a dinner plate sitting on top of the package) and there isn't any cleaning instructions with it. My dry cleaner is not sure how to proceed due to having No Label. The hood is huge, Falls in my face, but it  folds back so you can  fix that problem ."
4.0,"I love the look on this watch,the problem was the day of the week dial didn't work,so I had to exchange it for an other one, everyone looks at it anywhere I go , I'm not into watches so I just wanted one nice one and this is it."
4.0,"It is just a little too short in the front to truly wear it for a dress. The bottom button is a little too high and would show off my undies. Thankfully I was planning on wearing it with leggings anyways so it won't matter too much. Just be aware that it would show things off if not careful, unlike what the picture shows. I also have a short torso so for long torsos that would be even more of a concern. It is comfortable."
4.0,"I’m going to call this a shawl. The only thing you need to be aware of is the length; it was longer than I expected, at 5’10” it came down to my knees both front and back. As long as you’re good with the length you will love this shawl. It’s soft and has a nice smooth feel. It requires hand washing, and I’d be very surprised if it didn’t. The beads don’t look tacky and give it a bit of personality. Overall it’s very nice."
4.0,I love the belt...I have seen these  belts around for a few years now. It's a great Idea & I will never go back to a conventional belt ever again. I have to say that I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the leather..but all in all it's a great belt!...Love it!......Thanks!
4.0,"The MoFiz Mens Short Sleeve Polo Sport Shirts Cotton Stretch Golf Shirt Athletic Casual Tee is made of 95% Cotton, which is soft, breathable and comfortable. The stand collar with reinforced bottom, three-button placket are all same as description. The size is true size, I am 5'9"" tall and 145 lb, the M size fits me well. The material is machine washable, easy to care. I like the pink color, I wore it for golf couple times, felt very well.<br /><br />The only problem is after two times washing, the logo on the front has came off, but left a black mark, affecting the appearance."
4.0,"I needed a full-coverage suit for pool workouts, but did not want to pay some of the high prices that I found on other websites.  In the past, I have swum competitively and was accustomed to paying upwards of $100/suit to find the quality and performance that I needed.  I was willing to give this one a try after reading the reviews but was not very hopeful since I am rather picky.  To my surprise, this suit is feels like a higher priced competitive suit in regard to fit, support, and material.  It gives a nice compression to the the thighs and allows for full freedom of movement in the upper body.  I am 5' 5'' and 185lbs and found the 3XL to be a good fit.<br /><br />Con:  I would have loved to find the same compression and support in the chest area of the suit.  This areas seems to be a bit undercut in the underarm and chest area.  It is modest and offers removable formed cups, but it is lacking the structure and compression found in the lower half of the suit.  This may work out fine for those wearing a S-L, but in the XL sizes, this kind of support is plus (corny pun intended).<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice practice suit or lap workout suit and don't want to break the bank, this one is a winner."
4.0,These were nice. But the frames were a bit too tight for my head.
4.0,Nice t-shirt but run a little large. I left it anyway because the shirt is very trendy and comfortable. Will look nice with jeans.
4.0,"It fits small. Order 2 sizes up.  I purchased a size 18 and it fits like a 14, which is what I wear."
4.0,"These are smaller when it comes to pocket, but these do the job and add points to your style"
4.0,Very cute and very nice. Good buy
4.0,"Perfect party dress for over 40 ladies. I am very pleased with the looks of this dress. Caution: runs small. I read the reviews and ordered an &#34;extra-large.&#34; I am 5'4&#34; and 142 lbs, dress barely fit across the chest. I have no idea how it will hold up and despise hand-washing, but really do not anticipate any difficulties with it."
4.0,"As other reviews mentioned it does have a smell when you first open it, but I like the styling and the fabric, and the price is great.  I just wish the company would offer more sizes.  I know it's Asian sizing, but some Americans are small too.  The L was definitely big on me (I'm  5'3&#34; currently 115lbs).  It arrived about a week earlier than promised which was great."
4.0,"Its a one size fits most and Im rather busty, so it wouldn't close completely. Its really pretty and my boyfriend didnt seem to mind lol."
4.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this, the price was so cheap.  But I am pleased to report this is a great looking classy watch.  The minimalist design, black face and gold watch band look very high end.  With the flywheel winding function (you can get mechanical as well as battery powered from the same company) I don't have to mess with it much.  It also will show the day of the week and a calendar setting that takes some fiddling to figure out.  But that's not why I got it.  I needed something sharp looking to wear on my wrist when I'm dressed up and going out.  This fits the bill nicely."
4.0,"These Indoor! Bootie's are Great for keepin your Feet Toasty!  However... Do Not go marching through Any Weeds or Outdoor debris as You Will most certainly find a lot of Hitch Hikers Riding into Your Home on these Fuzzy Bunnies!  I did have to do a minor Restitch on one of the Heal cordage that ties into the Side Strap Junction. The Heal piece is not the Best Design so you've gotta make sure to &#34;NOT PULL ON THE HEAL PIECE WHEN PUTTING ON!&#34; Instead...<br />Slide your foot in as far as possible holding onto the sole of the slipper, Then carefully slip the heal piece up around your Heal. ( It helps to open the cuff of the heal piece also!)  HAPPY FEET!"
4.0,"So far, so good. It’s actually decent in comfort , durability seems reliable. The watch band has metal components (Big Plus), doesn’t come off as cheap material, time will tell. Definitely better than the original band that came with Amazon watch"
4.0,Very nice dress..got lots of compliments
4.0,"Expands like crazy! Fits a ton of stuff, easy to wash, and can hold a pretty good amount of weight, love them!"
4.0,"Great color, great fit! It was exactly what I was expecting. I just wish it was a teeny bit longer... but it's otherwise perfect for what I was looking for."
4.0,"Very cute and sexy suit, well made with good material. Sad it didn't work out for me. I'm a petite small and it fit well, just didn't WOW me. But returns and refunds are excellent and quick!"
4.0,Pros:<br />Fits like a glove lol.<br />Can use my phone while wearing them.<br />Waterproof.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Zipper broke on the first use.<br />They did not keep my hands warm in below freezing conditions.
4.0,The dress looked better than expected for the price.  Good quality and pretty light pink color.  My only complaint is that it is somewhat scratchy on the inside of the dress.
4.0,"The jaw doesn't actually open. It's a fully closed mask except for eye holes. Closer examination of the product pictures show that. It's still a great mask and suited my needs just fine, but people expecting to move the jaw will be disappointed."
4.0,Good sturdy bag. The only complaint is that the adjustable straps don't hold tight. Have to keep adjusting
4.0,Tight in the arms a little.
4.0,"The fabric is fresh, the elastic is thick and it doesn’t cut your irrigation.  Are longer than the shown in the picture.  I would give five stars if the knee where shorter as shown in the picture."
4.0,Comfortable fabric and a good fit.
4.0,Arrived and fit just as expected! Very comfortable shoes! I am on feet all day for work and they still were comfy at the end of the day.
4.0,I should have purchased a medium size instead
4.0,This suit is cute but the fit is off for my body type. I’d probably go a size up next time to try and get a little more coverage.
4.0,"Perfect long sleeve shirt for running. Arm sleeves are 1/2 shorter than I’d like but I also push my sleeves up shortly after start. True to size. I ordered a small. 5’8”, 130lbs, bra size 34B."
4.0,The glasses were what we expected
4.0,I like the dress very much have received many compliments I would order a size larger than you need and the material is a bit thinner than I expected but overall for the price it is a very nice dress
4.0,"Nice hat with the brand's name, REBEL printed on the bill. Its a a chambray denim that is very appealing, but the fabric feels slightly feminine though advertised as a mens , even going so far as to say its for Dad. The hat has grommets for air circulation and an adjustible strap in back."
4.0,"Great, minimal looks. It held my laptop, notebooks, etc for a year, then one of the zipper tracks gave out and the zipper went out. Looks like the seams are going too. But while it lasted it was great. Just be prepped to buy another in a year."
4.0,wish they would do a better closing<br />liked the style
4.0,"Requires hand washing, but so cute it's worth it!"
4.0,"For well, stretch, easy to clean, comfortable, and warm. The grips are nice but make it very difficult to put shoes on."
4.0,"Looks high quality, substantial and manly. However it’s size is much larger than expected. This is not a bad thing."
4.0,My stepson loved it!
4.0,"This watch is so cute!  I didn't realize the watch itself is so small, but the numbers are bold so there is no problem seeing the time.  This watch was delivered VERY early, great service from the company!!"
4.0,The rope style chain is perfect for an active kid and it is exactly how it looks. Many compliments on this necklace we love it.
4.0,They're pretty earrings but they are huge.  I really expected them to be about half the size they are.
4.0,"I thought the glasses were going to have a white frost look on the bottom half, they do not. Guess it was the reflection in the photo. They also did NOT come in a nice sturdy case, I was looking forward to that. It did NOT come with the tester card to check for polarization. It did come with a pouch, the wipe, tool to fix it & something that looks like a a finger loop that u can stick on the back of your phone. So far they seem good, not too dark in my personal opinion like some other reviews said."
4.0,Very cute but too tight on my size 12 butt.
4.0,"I bought an xl and am currently pregnant. I’m very happy with the size and bit of stretch that the material has. I love that the dress has pockets. The material itself does feel a bit cheap, maybe slightly overpriced for a $20 dress. The pattern is not exactly the same as shown on Amazon, but it’s similar.  Overall, it’s a cute fit for a reasonable price."
4.0,I typically wear small gloves and the Small/Medium is too large-- there was an inch extra space in front of each finger. Quality and warmth seemed decent though.
4.0,As with most new shoes it'll take a bit to break in. The somewhat small is because the cross strap is a little tight. Hopefully it'll stretch with wear.
4.0,"My measurements are as follows:  210 pounds, 5'7"" tall, 44"" waist, and 44DD bra size.  The olive and plum colors are beautiful.  The side splits are modest and tasteful, and the pockets are well placed.  The dress is quite loose fitting, however, almost mumu-ish, and I should've ordered the XL instead of the XXL.  I love the style, though, and its floor-length design is perfect for my tall frame."
4.0,I'm usually a medium. I ordered a medium and it fits great. This is a cute dress/ bathing suit cover up.
4.0,Definitely a really nice jersey. I am however bothered by the fact that the yellow on the jesery does not match the embroidery. Not a deal breaker IMO but more of an OCD thing.
4.0,Looks good especially for the price.
4.0,I love how each pair of underwear came packaged separately. The material felt soft and extremely comfortable. It was very easy to move about wearing this material. I didn’t notice any sweat markings after workout. My only dislike is that there is no hole to use the restroom.
4.0,Bag holds a ton!
4.0,Its a bit bigger but comfy shoes
4.0,"Thus far, I think it is great.  Looks great, especially for the price.  I am hoping the color doesn't fade. The ad said it's titanium and won't.  If that is the case, this is a GREAT deal.  I needed a gold bracelet for my gold jewelry and this is a great addition.  I like that the bangles are interlocked, gives it a very nice look.  So far, very impressed."
4.0,"I'm using my red one as a cross body purse as there are times I just don't want to drag a big purse around. When I want to go back to a big one, I could just tuck this inside the big one. The red is perfect with jeans. It appears to be real leather exterior and the lining fabric is better than most. But it smelled horrible! I don't know if the included lavender sachet is meant to cover up the smell? I think it made the smell worse as the sachet pretty much smelled like the purse by this point. I aired it out 2 days, sprayed it with 2X strong Febreeze; it still has an odor, its just a fraction more manageable now. With that smell I'll be assured never to lose my purse, just follow the smell!"
4.0,"A wee bit itchy, but very flattering to a curvier figure."
4.0,"I purchased this for a trip to NYC, and it served its purpose fairly well. It's a very light scarf, but there's plenty of width for doubling it up. I found that it was warm enough for the 15-30 degree temperatures I wore it in, but I would have wanted something heavier if it were colder or I would be out for longer periods of time.<br /><br />Looks-wise, it is attractive, but won't fool anyone into thinking it's a premium product. It looks a little fancy for street clothes; it's better suited for a button-down or sweater than it is for a sweatshirt. The craftsmanship seems to be acceptable, especially for the price.<br /><br />If you're looking for ski-wear, I'd look for something heavier, but if you're looking for a light-weight scarf for an evening out, it should fit the bill."
4.0,Ordered for my size and was bit loose on many spots. Was a heavy duty material.
4.0,"i wear a 43 belt and this was rated as a 43-44. It's exactly what I needed/wanted but, it doesn't fit, too big. It's probably a 44-45."
4.0,nice item for the money!! Quick delivery!! Would like to see more cockatiel themed items.
4.0,"Everything id GREAT except drawstrings. They cannot within washer and dryer, maybe if you hand wash it can a great buy."
4.0,Was a good gift.
4.0,"Not that well made, However look expensive if you do not look at them closely !"
4.0,"Great product, nice design and feel. The tank does run 1 size small (if you wear a large i would go with XL)! But overall I doubt you would be disappointed."
4.0,"I love the look, the style, the flow, but it definitely runs small. I also thought this was fading into black, but it is white and blue."
4.0,Runs a bit larger if you're slim fit
4.0,"Got the job done, but it felt somewhat small. I wonder if this is just b/c of my ginormous head. I had to reposition my bun a bit to get it to work, but I couldn't get the total coverage I wanted. It came with a hair net and I think that really elevated the usability and quality of this project :)"
4.0,Nice shirt to wear with jeans.
4.0,The socks are super cute!! Only complaint is that one pair came and the middle was too tight and you can’t really wear them comfortably.
4.0,I got this wanting a big shirt and it fits just like I hoped/expected. Love the graphic and the color probably will order more.
4.0,"Fabric thinner than expected but not in a bad way, just more of a spring item."
4.0,"It is much smaller than I expected, but it is sterling silver and very pretty.  I purchased this for my 16 yr old granddaughter who loved it.  However she says she has to tighten it to get it to stay on her ear and it pinches.  But she says she likes it so much that she doesn't mind the minimal pain. She got a pair of studs to go with it which was nice."
4.0,Material is very soft and it is comfortable but runs small
4.0,"Hermoso! A excepción de la tapa, no es como muestra en la lo que ofrecen, al colocarlo el arete no queda seguro"
4.0,"This shirt fit a bit on the large size, but it is so comfortable and great looking that the difference is minimal."
4.0,"It's light, and the chain is nice, love the way it feels, if you have the right finger size, you could wear it as a ring. The writing is a little hard to see, but overall it gets a good review."
4.0,"this cap is a bit smaller than my other caps,"
4.0,Runs small.  Love the shirt
4.0,These are precious but VERY LARGE. My little one will have to wait a whole before wearing.
4.0,"Very classy and very flattering. Its smaller than I would prefer so I ended up giving this to my mother who it looked fabulous on. Its a very vintage 80s mom look that has come back in fad. Actually, my mom owned outfits like this in the 80s and she looks the same as she did back then... It looked great and she loved it. I washed it in warm and dried on medium without shrinking or problems. As it is one piece, its a quick way to look chic when you are on the go... perfect for work or a day out at the market."
4.0,"very nice, a great deal! looks as I expected."
4.0,I thought they were going to fit too tight around my calf but the fit is perfect. They are roomy enough for me to wiggle my toes. Love them
4.0,"Decent quality for the price. The heel backs are a bit rigid and can be uncomfortable without thick socks, but adhesive cushions will likely help. Besides that issue, I can wear them all day with no problems."
4.0,I like the look but not so much the fabric.
4.0,These little slippers were adorable :)  They also kept my baby girl's feet quite warm while she toddled around.
4.0,I went to two local jewelers trying to find a new wrist band. One didn't have the right size and both were slightly double the price I paid on Amazon. The band is almost the exact same as the original. I'm very pleased.
4.0,These are well made boxer shorts with cute print on them. Sons likes them but has said they are a bit scratchy at times. They are not super soft ( can tell just by feeling the material) and that may bother some.
4.0,This case is HUGE! I am looking for a water proof case for a while and finally chose this one. I am right because it is high quantity and fit my iPhone very well.
4.0,"Very cute! Took awhile to get here but worth the wait, it does twist together so if you buy it make sure you have a place to hang it up, other than that it's perfect! (:"
4.0,Very good basic socks. I wish they had slightly more padding.
4.0,"It is very pretty and the chain and metal portion of the pendant are heavier gauge than expected, which was a pleasant surprise."
4.0,"I'm 5'7 140 pounds and ordered large. Good fit. Not super tight but form fitting and really cute with my harley combat boots. They are heavier than leggings like a stretchy pant type material. Super comfy.<br /><br />Pros: Two large front pockets are functional. Easy to side Iphone in.<br />Has a unique look that I like and know noone else will have a pair, almost futuristic.<br /><br />Cons: Button would not fit in button hole. I had to take scissors and cut it to fit.<br />I will have to sew the bottom of the zipper, no sewing there is not secure. Will take me 5 minutes top.<br /><br />Overall a good buy if you like this style of clothes even if you have to make a few adjustments here or there or along the way."
4.0,"The dress looks great and is flattering. There is clear plastic elastic sewn into the waist of the dress that is very annoying. I am going to hand sew a strip of fabric over it so I can wear it without going nuts. The elastic is probably needed because the fabric is so soft and thin, but it would be better if it was fabric elastic."
4.0,Looked great with a evening dress . Love them .
4.0,really liked this and helped with not getting sun burn
4.0,My father loves these shoes!
4.0,"These earrings come in a cute little black box, and each pair is in its own little baggie. I bought these earrings because I used to have plugs, and regular earrings just won't stay in my slightly larger holes (people with regular holes can wear these no problem). Initially I thought they were too heavy, as I could slightly feel them in my ears as I walked around, but after the first day I couldn't notice them anymore. I only have one complaint, which is some of them screw off from the post, and some of them screw off from the galaxy earring part, so you have to put them in differently depending on the earring."
4.0,"These slipper socks are super comfy and very cute. I feel like they run small, size 10 is usually a little big on me so I ordered the 10-11 size and these fit but wouldn't be very comfortable on a larger foot. I'm a little nervous to see if they still fit after the take a trip through the washer and dryer."
4.0,Great bag 💼! Perfect for a carry on. Received right on time.
4.0,Fits perfectly. However the material of the cheetah pattern looks kinda cheap @ first glance.
4.0,We ordered these dresses in several sizes for flower girls. They looked spectacular and photographed beautifully. Be careful with the tulle. It tore on one of the dresses pretty quickly.
4.0,The material is thin but was good. Wore it to a Christmas pub crawl and got a lot of compliments on it! Length was a little past knees.
4.0,"These are a great color and equal in quality to similar leggings I've purchased so I ordered the size I wear in those. Sometimes I'm not totally sure how much credence to give reviews about fit because I never know what people were expecting. As a size 6 or 8, muscular 137 lbs 5'4&#34; the medium was far too small. I would guess the large would be too small as well. The seller made it right but be forewarned."
4.0,my purchase was way too small.  I have an older one of these and ordered the same size.  This one was a size or two too small.
4.0,"This dress is light weight material, and the design is nice. The quality of the fabric is not great, and it runs big in size. It doesn’t quite look as pictured on the model, but it fits comfortably."
4.0,I love almost everything about this mask. It’s nice and thick. The drawstring is amazing to help keep the darn thing up. The one drawback is that it is way too long and bunches up at the shoulders.
4.0,"These Merino Wool socks have more stretch than my previous socks from my other manufacturer, therefore not nearly as tight. Not sure how I feel about it yet and will know more as time goes on. They definitely are not as tight at the top and that's a pretty good thing. I have not washed any yet and will determine then how well they stay up. If I am walking around the house with no shoes they do tend to slide around on my feet somewhat because of the looser fit.<br /><br />Every company on Amazon wants a review before you really have time to test and I may report back at a later date. At this point they seem decent and the price is pretty good compared to some other brands.<br /><br />4 stars for now and may upgrade later once I've worn them a while."
4.0,The pendant was a lot bigger than I expected. It was the size of a dollar coin may be slightly bigger. The chain dangles pretty low to the upper belly button. It's nice to go with chic casual clothes. Its not heavy but the pendant is made with a plastic feel.
4.0,Material different but got a lot of compliments on it.<br />A little baggy in the crotch but overall I worked with it!
4.0,Great for the &#34;masked ball&#34; my husband's employer hosted.  Held up through the evening--that's all I expected for the price.
4.0,"Good quality and nice pattern.  Pants were a bit long for my husband, but the top fits well."
4.0,I ordered this with the straps because I have a larger than normal under arm pockets of fat. Hopefully the straps help to minimize my under arm luggage.
4.0,I did order up just in case and it came as very large. Otherwise very comfy
4.0,Very nice top and it fits very nice.  I just wish the material had a little more substance to it.
4.0,I love this bag.  My only complaint is it is a lot smaller than what I thought. There is not a lot that fits inside but so far it is working for me.
4.0,"I love this necklace. The only two issues I have with it is; 1) The way they tied the knot makes the pentacle constantly flip over so the backside is showing. I had to untie the knot before it was fixed and now its fine. 2) This isn't really an issue with the necklace and perhaps I should have said that earlier however the title of the necklace is wrong. This is not a pentagram. Its a pentacle which is a five pointed star contained within a circle. Pentagrams and Pentacles are two different symbols though both are often used in magick. So really the knot was the only issue. The stone in the middle of the necklace is awesome because the way the light hits it, causes it to light up which draws your eyes to the blue stone and the necklace as a whole. The detailed artwork is great too. So this necklace in summary is well worth the money and I look forward to buying more from this retailer."
4.0,These boots came in and fit my daughter perfectly.  Their craftsmanship is superb.  If you are looking to have cosplay boots created I would suggest talking to this company.
4.0,The outfit was super cute.  All of patches were attached perfectly.  It was slightly large but she is only 3 wks. She weighed about 10 lbs at the time.  Delivery was fast as well.
4.0,Just like pictured. Nice design.
4.0,Dirt cheap but you view the world through a brown filter. I wear these when I'm not sure they're going to make it home. Stiff armseems too and don't hang flat from a collar or button. But what a price.
4.0,"I love these how they come on and off easily with velcro. The material is flimsy, but strong. It doesn’t feel like a leather, more of a thick layered cloth. None of that bothers me, but I don’t like that the holes are so open in the front that my toddlers big toe slides right through the front when he walks. They fit him well, true to size, otherwise."
4.0,My only complaint is that they are VERY slippery
4.0,"Four stars because this is a little bit large overall. I'm 5'2"" , 125 pounds and usually take a six or small. However, I have a C cup bust and any smaller than a medium and it wouldn't fit across that area. However, great color, hangs well and material very soft and comfy--and warm enough with tights underneath for fall days."
4.0,Lovely material and color but very snug. Order up a size
4.0,Nice lanyard but kind of stiff. The clips are a little stiff as well. But it does the job and keeps your mask around your neck for easy retrieval.
4.0,"This dress fitted well, I was not disappointed. Recommended."
4.0,"The arm around the top is tight,the rest of this top is big."
4.0,"This is a very nice piece of jewelry.  Quality is not bad, pretty to look at too.  Not that thick though."
4.0,The waste band is a little wierd for me
4.0,I have purchased 3 pairs of these over the past 6 months.  The first pair fits perfectly! The second pair was about an inch shorter and a little tighter.  The third pair is also shorter and tighter.  It is nearly impossible to find compression socks for extra wide calves.  It would be nice if the sizing for the same product could be consistent.  I love the first pair. They come up high enough and have just enough compression. If I knew they'd all fit like pair #1 I would order 10 more pairs!  Overall quality is great. I have washed them all several times.  No snags.
4.0,"Purchased a large, which should've been the right size but I feel like it was the size of a 2XL or 3XL... it was HUGE! The tag said large but I wasn't expecting how large it was. It was a great product, well made, just didn't fit."
4.0,I've seen a definite reduction in eye strain when working on the computer!
4.0,"Very well made dress which washed up nicely. The material was of a nice summer  weight.  The reason I gave it 4 star rating was that the color was not beige but buttery yellow,  Also it did not have pockets.  I am going to keep the dress."
4.0,"Very comfortable and cute, but order at least one size up. I wish I ordered two sizes up. I prefer my hoodies to be a bit more loose"
4.0,"A very decent and well made Polarized sunglasses for men.  Nothing spectacular, but fit and finish are good and it fits on my face very well."
4.0,Great product for the price.  Looks great and functions well!
4.0,I haven’t washed it yet. But I love the way it looks.
4.0,"These were a gift, they arrived on time, are exactly as pictured. When my granddaughter wore them- they did look larger on her ears than I expected but looked nice."
4.0,"The necklace is out of this world pretty! Earrings are also, but they are pretty heavy. So will probably do like another buyer and split them up into two different earrings, one post, one wire. Definitely worth the price."
4.0,got here a little later but its what i was what i expected :)
4.0,These fit me perfect.
4.0,"I love this oversized sweatshirts! Even though the tag says dry clean, I wash it gentle cycle/cold and hang dry. My vinyl is holding up just fine. I would buy more of these if they had additional sayings!! Only wish it had pockets ..."
4.0,Ok fits
4.0,"I liked these leggings a lot. They felt good, a little loose on the ankles, which was kinda weird but nice fit elsewhere. I wore them 4-5 times and they ripped right up the butt in the middle of kickboxing, leaving me standing there in all my glory. Disappointing. I would not purchase again as I can’t trust that I will not be standing in class baring my behind for all to see.<br /><br />*Update* - Seller sent me a new pair of leggings after I left my review. I haven't had a chance to test them out multiple times to make sure the same problem doesn't happen, but more stars for customer service and hoping these ones hold up!"
4.0,"This belt is a great belt for the price, I have a 40 inch waist and it has quite a bit of length to spare. I'm giving only 4 stars because the buckle was pretty lacking and had some sharp edges (as mentioned in other comments) but I have a few nice ones laying around since I have been using this kind of belt since I was a kid. Bottom line, nice long belt very cheap buckle but a great price!"
4.0,There is a lot of shrinkage definitely buy it too big....
4.0,Cute casual top for the money. It does not lay as nice as pictured but I got lots of compliments on it. Not sure how it’s going to wash though.
4.0,I got them for $7.99. They're kind of cheesy but I got what I paid for.
4.0,Thought it be little thicker material but still liked what I recived. Its almost like nylon flag material made into a apron. Was pleased though and price is right
4.0,nut holding switch came off... fairly easy to fix... not too noisy as others have posted
4.0,"I enjoy these as I like to be able to take them and throw them in the wash. I've been wearing mine for a couple of months now and don't have any wear and tear. I was skeptical of the price as I expected them to be flimsy, but once I broke them in (they were a bit stiff to start) they are very comfortable."
4.0,I have a pretty small face. adult glasses tend to engulf me. These look good.
4.0,"TOO small not a true size, returned it TOO small not a true size, returned it"
4.0,"Bought for grandchildren and they are hard to fit in some belt loops for 8yo jeans. Will work for older kids better, but smaller kids might not fit as easy. Once they are on, its great."
4.0,"The material is better than most costumes in my opinion. Fits great. Not thin, see through or flimsy."
4.0,"Pretty, flattering fit. Material is a little thin, but I layer it under a cardigan and it’s fine."
4.0,I want something dainty to wear everyday and thought this would be perfect. The earring is super cute and unique. However I have the hardest time wearing this earring. I had to bend the metal every time I wear it and I am worried that eventually cause it to break.
4.0,I like the socks very much however it seems to take an unusually long time to be delivered.
4.0,"I'm a 42D and bought the XL size based on a review from another reviewer who was bigger than me.  When I first opened the box, I was surprised because I didn't think my 13 year old grand-daughter would fit in it.  I kept an open mind and tried one on.  I didn't have to be a contortionist to get into it!  There was plenty of stretch and sure, it's a little snug, but my husband hasn't complained and I feel comfortable in them.  The colors haven't faded even after going in the pool.  Love the front adjusting straps too.  I would recommend these.  They're comfortable, colorful and if I did yoga (ha!) I'm sure they'd be good for that too."
4.0,"I love these and luckily I’m a small person so they fit well. I have a small head lol, but heads up they are tight on me."
4.0,Speedy shipping. Good quality. Cute shoes!!
4.0,"This shoe stretching spray seems to be working fine. The shoes I bought it to stretch were extremely tight. I used as directed for stretching while wearing and I see some improvement. Now I have them on the shoe stretchers and haven't checked yet. I've used other stretching aids, and this one is very easy to apply as it is a spray and easily saturates the inside of the shoe.<br />The only thing I'm not wild about is that one needs to wear socks when stretching. I'm assuming that Is to keep the product off the skin. So I'm thinking stockings wouldn't work because they wouldn't give a barrier. Adding socks to an already tight shoe is extremely uncomfortable. Then one must wear the shoe until dry. I needed to spray again to continue the stretch. By the time I was done my feet were killing me. So I then sprayed again and put them on the stretcher.<br />So far so good."
4.0,"I have a 36 inch waist and ordered a large pair. The elastic waist is tight.  They fit through the hips and leg fine.  The length is good too if you typically wear a 32-34 inseam.  If I ordered again, I would get the extra large so that the waist would not be so tight."
4.0,I’ve tried to get a dress like this for some time but they never fit the way I wanted…this one does!  Not form fitting so it doesn’t stick to my curves. I’ve gained a bit of weight and this covers it perfectly. I can wear a cami under it without looking bulky. The reason for the 4 stars is that it’s way too long. However my daughter suggested TYING IT ON THE SIDE AT THE BOTTOM….BINGO! It looks very trendy and brings the length up where I want it. I just ordered another one in a different color 😁
4.0,"I love the design, if it was in yellow gold, I would have gave five stars."
4.0,"Customer service and a quality made jacket is what these guys deliver. They double checked my measurements before shipping out. Replies to emails were in an hour or less. The jacket it self is a pretty cool style, lightweight. The leather and stitching are perfect.<br />I had issues with the jacket being a bit oversized. I emailed them and had a reply back in no time flat with a return address and a promise to fix it.  Like I said, they deliver customer service at its best."
4.0,A little loose but still overall great buy!!!
4.0,"I really only need glasses to read or see things within 20"". Consequently, most reading glasses require me to take them off every time I want to see something further away. The 1/2 lenses of these glasses allow me to read through the glasses yet easily see above them for distance viewing. So for me these are much more convenient. They are comfortable to wear and the glasses with the frames are lightweight."
4.0,"It was small for my baby, but it's really beautiful and nice quality cap!"
4.0,"Super cute dress, especially for the price! Has a zipper up the side and the material is quite stretchy, so it’s easy to get on and off. The straps are also adjustable which helps fit women with different chest sizes. For context, I am 5’9,140 lbs with a pear shape (very small chest) and this fit me great! It is short, but definitely not too short, and I’m a tall girl. Only complaint is that the shoulder ties got pretty beat up and ragged when I washed it (I did not put it through the dryer), so you may want to hand wash it."
4.0,"I have these on my issued eye pro.  They work well, but after being placed in and out of my OCP's one of them started pulling off.  I cleaned them and reinstalled with no issue."
4.0,Nice compact wallet hardly know it's there.  Takes alittle time to get use to.
4.0,"I like this bathing suit; it is unique.  I also like that the back is mesh on top.  It runs very big though.  I am usually a medium and purchased a small, which I feel is still too big.  But, the elastic is also not very stretchy.  That could be a plus for some people and to be honest I don't like super tight clothes, but I feel at times that the back it is not holding me in enough and feels as if it is falling down."
4.0,I've really enjoyed wearing these so far. They're very comfy and dressy or casual!
4.0,"Good,  cheap baby shoe. Works well for my one year old learning to walk and get his balance.  Won't last forever but all in all a good buy."
4.0,A little thick and bulky but many compliments
4.0,I bought this for my sister for Christmas. When it came in the mail it said “brother”. My brother is not sweet like that so I would never give this to him. But I did still give it to my sister which made it a joke also. We laughed a couple times over it and she uses it on her keychain everyday.
4.0,"They were nice, comfy look good"
4.0,They are beautiful earrings but the backs were too lose.  Put a different pair of backs on them do you don’t lose them!
4.0,"Nice, simple and elegant"
4.0,It's a very beautiful piece
4.0,Bought this for my Wife for summer wear with t-shrts and bikinis.  Really light and interesting.  Looks great on skin or lighter clothes.  Its not high fashion but you also don't freak out if you leave it at the beach or pool.
4.0,Material is thick.. Which is good so you can wear during winter months.. I'm 5'2 so you definitely will have to wear heels with this shirt.. But super cute..
4.0,Son bonitas!!! Un poco fragil!
4.0,"Pretty cool, unique sunglasses. Block sun well. For price a bit flimsy. But super cute."
4.0,I love my Twist-O-Flex watch band! I had one on my Timex watch for years. Having one on my Apple Watch has made it so much more enjoyable. Easy to put on and take off. Fits just right. I had to remove links in order to get the best fit and it would be great if you could include some instructions and/or YouTube links for how to perform this procedure.
4.0,Bought Xl returned for XXL .super cute. Definitely size up unless you want a more snug fit. I am ordering another color. Return process was so simple.
4.0,"This was kind of a blind buy because there were no reviews but I really thought this dress is cute so I went ahead and ordered. I am so glad I did, this dress is adorable. This dress is soft stretchy cotton with a with hint sheen to it and very well made. I'm querer tener sexo and 220 and a L fits me perfectly. Dress is slimming. It comes down past my ankles but can still be worn with flats. Can be dressed up or down. There was no shrinkage after washing."
4.0,"[[ASIN:B0183JVB8E Desen Unisex Adult Aviator Sunglasses (Black Gray)]]<br />Very Sharp---Come with a case & a cleaning cloth.  Look nice on.  However they are a bit flimsy, not very strong wearing.  Good for car glasses,not for any kind of sport or type of fast moving activity.  But nice glasses still the same."
4.0,Cute and fits well. Headband was a little tight but we really just needed the suit
4.0,"Excellent space and gives the impression of nice fabric, but the clip (or belt) looks bad quality. It looks and feels like is going to brake if you exert a high force on it. There aren't too much extraspaces but the main and the accesory space works good enough. I haven't try it on the rain, so I can't give an opinion on its waterproof ability. But I think this is a good deal for the price."
4.0,"Easy wear, beatiful but easy lost"
4.0,"I LOVE this dress! It’s true to size, I’m 5’3, between 140 - 145 (depending on the day) and 36B. As other reviewers have mentioned the boobs will be out with this dress so I either put a fitted tank top under it or you could pin it. It has pockets (YAY!) but the placement kind of sticks out on the hips a bit. Overall it’s one of my favorite date night dresses and I’m really happy with it!"
4.0,"Bought this to go with my daughter’s Artemis Huntress costume she will be wearing for her Greek Goddess birthday parade in December. It’s easily adjustable. Just be carful of the end gold leafs. They can bend easily and if too much pressure is applied, they will probably break off. Otherwise, looks beautiful with her costume. We also got the matching headband."
4.0,"Overall, great product. One frustration is the sizing guide is not accurate, as I went a couple sizes over my waist size when cutting but it barely fits now. It's my own fault for cutting too short without testing, but I would have figured giving myself 2 sizes over would have been sufficient. Other than that, the quality and functionality are great. It comes very nicely packaged with a leather key chain."
4.0,"Pants are cute, fit like leggings."
4.0,"This item is just as pictured. For me, they are slightly large for every day use however I wore them on 2 formal occasions and received a lot of compliment. For as large as they are; the earrings are very lightweight and do not pull the earlobes down"
4.0,"I wear size 14-16, and the XL fit perfectly, these dresses to run small. It can be worn with or without the bow. The only drawback is the shoulders are too puffy, they will need to be altered. Otherwise I am happy with the dress."
4.0,could be a tighter fit
4.0,"Bought this for my daughterecords. She needed a black dress a singing group she is in. It is simple yet elegant. She usually wears a large, but when it came it was  too snug. So she sent it back and ordered an XL. It fit."
4.0,this was so think nothing like I would expect for chiffon.  pretty color though.
4.0,Good price. Hard to find in stores. My husband is very happy!
4.0,Not bad for the price. I like that they came individually wrapped. I’m using for a teen’s birthday party ‘swag bag’. Size may be a bit tight for some adults though.
4.0,"Great bag, beautifully brilliant color. Holds everything and more. Bought to use for a normal purse as well as holding a new tablet. Holds everything great."
4.0,"Very pretty, but fits kind of weird!!"
4.0,Looks cute but don’t know how long will last.
4.0,"While the hat was great, the neck run really small, hard to get my head through it, and the lining didn’t remain hidden, as in the pictures"
4.0,"I bought these earrings for my daughter. She has one piercing in her ears and has REALLY wanted a double piercing, so these earrings seemed like the perfect solution for both of us- daughter that wants a double piercing and mom who says, no, one only.  The earrings are made of a thin silver material that is easily bent. The problem she ran into, was trying to figure out how to place the earring in one hole and wind the earrings around. At first it was an abysmal failure and we could not figure out how to make the earring look like a double piercing. Then we went back to the listing on Amazon that included pictures explaining how to use the earrings if you have piercing or if you have two piercings. Overall, I give this a 4 rating, as the wire is thin, a little thinner than I'd like and you have to go to the Amazon listing to figure out how to situate the earrings in your ears. However, they are quite pretty and now that we've figured out how to put them in, my daughter has received a lot of compliments when she wears them, and loves them."
4.0,"Small but very practical but wide enough to fit a cell phone and some small items., The surface. It's ""leather-like"" and has a shoulder strap also."
4.0,arrives deflated
4.0,It is lightweight fabric and perfect for warm weather. I up sized one size from what I usually buy and it is just perfect
4.0,Like it should very comfortable
4.0,"I have had this for a week, I think.  So far it is working out just great.  I just feel more secure with the watch clasp instead of the clip.  I wear mine all the time and it works out great."
4.0,So far seems to be very nice.
4.0,Perfect for what I needed. Had 1 small issues but FANTASTIC customer service took care of it right away! I would order from them again!!
4.0,"I was very happy with this shirt it's what I was hoping for style and comfort. I don't know what the point of the little crystal at the top center of the shirt is though. It almost looks like they put it there by mistake. Other then the crystal, I am very satisfied."
4.0,Got these to pair with a lace/faux leather dress for an outdoor concert. Looked. Fantastic. And amazing with a good pair of heels.
4.0,"1) This has a synthetic edge, which is commonly used when multiple layers are bonded together.<br />2) I highly doubt anyone selling the leather stock would make the mistake of stamping their product with a lower quality rating, especially when full grain leather is widely viewed to be the most premium<br /><br />when you cut off the excess* you will be able to dissect the throwaway part.  pulling the top away from the bottom will reveal the indsides.  I don't profess to be a leather expert and would appreciate feedback from anyone who (truly) is.  Skin, it's worth remembering, IS made up of layers, so I don't think the simple fact that this pulls apart is not necessarily proof at all that it's not full grain leather.  Anyone?<br /><br />* (if you need to do this to make your belt fit 'just right' (though be careful - if you cut off too much, then:<br />a) you won't have enough length for the ratchet to engage and<br />b) in my experience with other slide belts) , the area gripped by the teeth will get worn and will start slipping out of the buckle, and you should leave enough extra that you'll still have room to trim further when this happens)<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars nonetheless, as it seems to be otherwise well constructed and the price is quite reasonable.<br /><br />Other products tout full grain leather but are in the $100 range and would be interested to hear if any of you have found FG leather slide belts at a lower price."
4.0,"I like the dress, there’s no stretch to it. The material is soft, though. It is a little see through. I will need to order a slip to go underneath. Definitely needs a belt to give it some shape, otherwise it’s a little boxy."
4.0,"Lightweight. True to size. Only issue I had is the slip underneath is not the thickest - doesn't look totally see-through, but feels a bit opaque. Still love it, though!"
4.0,I like this bib but it is a little stiff.
4.0,Love the shoes!!!<br />I should have ordered my shoe size! This runs big. I suggest you get your real shoe size.<br />Im 7 but ordered 7 1/2😔
4.0,"I have super small wrists, so I wish the band could go a little smaller. However, I can still make it fit. Just looser than I typically wear my other watch bands. This band is super cute and great quality. I don’t regret purchasing!"
4.0,"It's good, but not enough on very cold days"
4.0,"Order a size up. My 9 year old is tall and skinny, and usually fits in small to medium, but not quite the right size here"
4.0,"This band is OK.  I would not say it is my favorite.  But the quality is decent, the color is nice and it seems OK."
4.0,"My daughter and her friends wanted to be cheifs players for halloween, so I went to amazon to see what some options where. After looking at many jerseys we decided this was the perfect one it arrived right on time about 4 days before halloween. It has some silicone like material for the number so hair got stuck easily, but it fit just right it was a little big but that’s the look they were going for. Overall i was not disappointed in this purchase. Definitely recommend."
4.0,"I have a lot of blouses in this type of fabric, which is easy to care for.  This olive color is nice for the fall.  I am 145#, 5'6"", size 8/10 and got a large.  The fit is very boxy. A smaller size may fit better, but the arms may be short.  If you are fuller on the top, this may fit you better.  I will probably put in in my rotation, but as a layering piece."
4.0,Not bad for the price! Go true to size.
4.0,I like it the sleeves are just a little tight around my arms
4.0,little short and stiff but pretty uch what I was looking for
4.0,"Great looking watch , well made . A bit large compared to most watches ."
4.0,"So I normally wear a medium and wearing this unfortunately my boobs don't stay in, the top kind of covers the nipples I've adjuster the straps and that helped slightly. I love the color I got and it feels flow. The thong fits as well and is made of stretchy material. I think this is great considering the price"
4.0,"I loved the style and material of the dress. The slip was too short, it barely covered the booty area. Besides that great dress."
4.0,love the bracelet!
4.0,This dress is so cute ! My height is 5'3 and weight is 195 ordered an XL . I wear a size 12 . Length is to my ankles perfect!<br />Only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because it's a little see through nothing that is 2 bad .
4.0,"Bolsa pequeña ideal para llevar un pequeño wallet,  un celular y las llaves . El material de tela es fuerte pero el sipper o corredera es un poco débil.  Por el precio, es aceptable."
4.0,"I probably could have gotten a smaller size - I ordered large and am 5'4 1/4&#34;, 135 lbs and 36C or CC.  I like that it goes under various workout tops and sun tops - doesn't provide much support, but it does what I expected it to."
4.0,"It took forever to receive my order. The hat is cheaply made and so big. I don't have problems with fit with other hats I've ordered. So I recommend you pay more and get a better quality because once again, you get what you pay for!"
4.0,"I was sort of put off by the left hand zipper but besides that I like this man's gown. I especially like the hood. I can let the dogs out at 20 degrees and even though it's light weight, I'm still warm."
4.0,"Be careful of leaving it in for several days it will turn colors, very pretty and sparkly though :)"
4.0,I think some things just dont fit some body types as well as they do others wasn't the right cut for me but okay garment
4.0,This is a beautiful bag. Well made it has a minimalist style. It is smaller than I anticipated. This is not a bad thing; it forces me to weed out unnecessary space hogs. It is comfortable to carry and versatile enough dor casual and more formal occasions.The red is pretty but a bit more reddish rust than a true red. I like it.
4.0,"This was a little too long for me, came to below my chest, but I easily adjusted it to sit at the collarbone. It's a bright gold, brass would've looked a little neater, but I had been eyeing a similar necklace on this site that was $45, so for the price, I'm happy. Neat addition to my jewelry box."
4.0,Does what it’s advertised to do. Keeps my stuff secured in my backpack.
4.0,"Other reviews are correct in describing. Soft material, not too thin, comfortable. I ordered an XL because my bust is 39CC and I like to have things loose around my stomach. I like the length, but some may find too long. The arms are just as big as pictured so for me I have to wear a cami or I wear with a sports bra cause I don't like my side boob or bra just hanging out. All in all cute shirt and a good price"
4.0,Great material. Looks nice. Runs maybe 1 size too small.
4.0,"The bra has something in the front that dips out.  I’m a 40 DD and although the suit is cute, i could get passed the piece in the front that stuck out."
4.0,"I like running shorts with pockets to carry tissue and occasionally keys. These have three pockets with zippers and an inside key holder. They are comfortable. I only gave 4 stars because the fabric is prone to static cling when I wear compression shorts under them. Otherwise, nice shorts for a very reasonable price.  This 70+ guy also likes the 7"" inseam."
4.0,"5&#34; 2 1/2<br />178 lbs.<br />34 D<br />32 waist<br />46 Hips<br />Keeping these measurements in mind the inseam is a bit too short. If you're over 5'' tall it's probably not for you. Other than that, it's an awesome outfit!"
4.0,"The seller, CLOLV Clothes & Shoes, sent me obviously used boots: filthy on bottoms, hair, crap etc., scuffed leather, marks on tight shoe & missing lace eyelet. Disappointing as the new ones are really nice. Keeping & will try to clean up as this seller, CLOLV, would charge me $20 to return. Amazon, Zappos direct have spoiled me. Will pay closer attention to who stuff is actually coming from. Oh well, no one died, just a pair of chucker boots, all scuffed up. 😳"
4.0,"I've been using the stretchy elastic bands for a while now but have run into the stretching out over time and weird rough spots so I thought I'd try this style<br />Love it! At first I was worried it wasn't going to fit right, I have a larger, for ladies sizing, 9"" wrist and it just made the fold over the plastic piece that connects to the Fitbit to reach the Velcro properly. Luckily, it stretched just a tiny bit, just perfect, and if it stretches more I have plenty of space to adjust it.<br />Keeping this is mind, those with very small wrists may have issues with stretching and running out of adjustment space.<br />My only complaint, and this is minor, is that the rainbow coloring is black with a tiny bit of muted colored sparkle. Meh, it works, but I like colorful items and this wasn't it.<br />I would definitely buy this again, just in a brighter color, but for those concerned that it's too bright - no worries. This could absolutely be worn with anything as it mainly looks like a black band."
4.0,"Too large, but I have a very small frame so maybe that’s why"
4.0,"Very cute! Got the cat as an actual sushi roll. The box was pretty beat up when I got it, but a funny gift none the less."
4.0,"Beautiful, substantial, and yet delicate."
4.0,For a 3x a little small in sleeves. Besides that great shirt
4.0,Fast shipping. I got a large and its a little big around my bust but I like it this way. Good run around shirt.
4.0,Came as a free give with my Akoya pearl earring purchase - so I can you say anything negative about that.
4.0,"I really like this dress, it’s not too short, fits just right, strings are little long though"
4.0,Beautiful costume well made. But it ran small. It fit my daughter but she won't be able to wear it in the fall for Halloween. She wore it to a royal ball at her school. Very nice and perfect lenght.
4.0,"the sleeves from the above the elbow is a little more form fitting, but the rest of it is baggy just how I like it, i'll defiantly be wearing this with some leggings this fall, because it reaches about mid thigh. I got a large, am 5 foot eight inches, just to give you an idea on how it fits."
4.0,These are great for the pilates studio and my slippery wood floors at home. They can slip off of I wear them in boots due to the soft roll tops but I still like the ones I have.
4.0,I recive the bag without the brand of Dior liters
4.0,Great size but the strap is way too long.  I had to make a hole.
4.0,"I ordered these thinking they would keep me nice and warm in the winter. They are nicely lined for sure. But my pair was just way too large, and I'm petite so they were also too long. I feel like they look more like tights versus leggings, with so much seam showing. Personally, these won't work for me."
4.0,good product..
4.0,Well. The fabric is soft and flowy rayon that feels perfect against my skin. The dress is comfortable. It is Not maxi long. I'll post a pic which I've never done but more and more I mistrust descriptions and very much rely on reviews. I am 5'9&#34; size 12. Also there's a seam in the front instead of the back which makes me uncomfortable because I keep thinking I'm wearing it backwards (but the tag is at my back).
4.0,Very nice  specimen of a rose but I believe it's way overpriced
4.0,My wife likes the bracelet.
4.0,"Not as wrinkle-free as I'd like, but with a bit of ironing it looks nice."
4.0,very roomy and made out of good materials good price too  the only thing that bugs me is thesnaps don't stay snapped well
4.0,Feminine and lovely leather! Many peeps stop me to admire and comment. A happy purchase. Left one star off only because there is no outer pocket for my cell phone or keys.  Kind of a kangaroo purse lover. Maybe maufacturer has an ear to the ground?  Will check back.
4.0,Nice ties for wedding
4.0,Really nice fabric really nice fit like the color
4.0,"I really liked this piece once I got it in my hand. Its large, maybe just a little too pointy"
4.0,"The ring size was off, but not worth returning for a different size. But it fit for a pinky ring. The ring has good weight on it, which is surprising considering the cost. It looks really good. I'm happy with the purchase. Like having lobster on a romen budget."
4.0,"Good looking at a very great price. Not as expensive looking in person, but the value is worth it, runs great."
4.0,"I measured 24&#34; inches around my forehead it fit tight not loose, I hoped it to be loose. But its good and comfortable."
4.0,Easy install and a great replacement for a poorly designed stock band.  The stock band kept falling off and this fixed the problem.  The design seems to have been airbrushed on but has held up to wear to far.
4.0,Thank U :-) תודה רבה
4.0,"Really soft and comfortable.  I wish they were a bit longer.  I ordered the heather brown color, it appears more of a maroon."
4.0,"I was super excited to get this swim suit, I'm a larger girl who loves her retro and most 2 pieces are for thinner girls now and days. I'll spare you the picture but here's what I have to say... IT FITS!!!! actually it's looser in the top and waist than I had planned for and a little tight in the thigh area. Other than that, great color, great, fit, great look. When i first opened the box it was placed in a plastic ziploc bag and was a bit damp from being on the UPS truck all day, it had a smell that I can only describe as vinegar that went away as soon as I washed the suit. I gave this 4 stars because I'm in the middle of a weight loss and if I go down a size (14 now) this suit won't fit like it says 3XL12-14.<br /><br />I recieved this product at a discounted price for my honest opinion."
4.0,Unfortunately I didn’t measure my leg length and they are about an inch too long. I am 5’5 and 195. I ordered a size 18. The fit is good in the hips and waist.  The flare on the legs is very dramatic. Overall I like the pants however I will have to hem them.
4.0,"very cute , fit well not tight at all"
4.0,Very short for an average men size wrist
4.0,Really cute shirt just way too big. I ordered a size small for my petite 9 year old. It’s about the size of a nightgown on her. It’s fine bc she loves it and I guess will grow into it.
4.0,"pros: solid, yet not too heavy frames, flexible temples, great lenses and optical clarity<br />cons: unfortunately, they were too wide for my face and i returned them"
4.0,"Very comfortable, easily broken in. Bought a second pair."
4.0,"I really liked the fit of this dress and it was comfortable, however too short for my liking. I will be returning. It is also a very heavy fabric and if you run warm you will be too toasty in this ensemble. Good quality though and fit as expected everywhere but length."
4.0,I was debating between retro russet and cognac. Glad I got the russet. It’s a little darker than the image shown but the color is fine. My wrist is 15cm and I have the strap on the last hole.  I’m not a fan of the end point of the strap almost touching the body of the Apple Watch.  Looks like I’m not wearing the correct size.  The material feels cheap but the variation in color makes it look like worn leather.  I’ll keep it and wear it in. Hopefully it will soften nicely
4.0,"pretty nice construction for the price. would have been nice for for warm weather, but it's too small. : ("
4.0,Really like the shoe wish they came in wider width
4.0,Cute and fits to a tee.
4.0,"This is a nice clean looking dress.  I thought it was red, white and blue.  But, it is black, red and white.  Still nice, but thought it was navy.  Flattering fit."
4.0,"These are very comfortable underwear. I don’t have any problems with them riding up when I move around. I do prefer cotton underwear, but I decided to keep them because they are so comfortable and fit so well. I’m 5’8, 130 lb and the small fit great."
4.0,"With the correct repair kit, this takes less than few mins to replace the strap and feels like a brand new one."
4.0,"The pajamas looked fantastic. Unfortunately, there were sharp points where the straps are sewn in the back. They were just a tiny bit smaller than the measurements on their chart. Also, they pick up every little bit of fuzz and pet hair."
4.0,"Have to put in the strings yourself, they're like shoe strings too, I was hoping they were like soft material, its kind of loose around my hip area but fits everywhere else, its cute tho definitely gonna wear it once we go out to a party for the holidays!"
4.0,"Was a cute dress but I am 5'6 and around 170lbs.  Bought this dress and thought it was cute.  I had the large home and it fit nice, material was nice etc. but for my height the side that goes up felt like I was exposing way to much flesh and if I sat down it went even higher.  I sent the dress back but if you like the really high cut on one side this might be the dress for you.  If that would have been 5 inches longer I would have kept it."
4.0,"My little opinion for the hand strap.....<br />the buckle is not tight ,,,and the  XA-PC1 Plate not fit Dovetail or ArcaSwiss tripod head,,,<br />only good for gun shot shoulder strap...<br /><br />but still the leather is well made,, and nice fell when you put on it,,,<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />Danny"
4.0,heavy  material but ok
4.0,"This is a beautiful slip on.  I get so many compliments on its beauty.  Not only is it pretty but well made, just runs a tad small."
4.0,It's a little more yellow than I wanted but the cut is nice and it seems like good quality. I got this for a costume but I'll probably end up wearing it.in regular life too.
4.0,Nice soft material. True to size. I wear a Medium and it fit perfect.  Packs well for travel.
4.0,"I wanted a &#34;Madonna/Gaultier-esque&#34; swimsuit and this is pretty close!  Thank you to all the ladies who wrote reviews you helped me get the correct fit.  It's a very chic suit for not a lot of coin.  I can hold my head up in St. Barts! ;) or Jupiter, FL. It's short waisted but so am I so we get along. I might push to the small side for extra VaVaVoom.  Why not!?"
4.0,It looks great. the smell was a little strong but only lasted a few days.
4.0,"Great feel, very comfy, sizes run big"
4.0,So cute! I originally ordered an xl based on reviews and the size chart but it was too big so I exchanged it for a large and it was perfect. Comes to just above the knee
4.0,"Its cute, but a little tight for my  daughter."
4.0,Bought this as part of a Coraline costume for 5 year old granddaughter.  Fit fine on her but would probably be a bit small for an adult.  Worked great for her costume and I cannot imagine anyone wearing it for anything else.  &#34;Hair&#34; was thin and you could see through to the base fabric when holding it but not when it was on her head.  Didn't tangle while being handled by a 5 year old and stayed on her head well.  Overall a good value for the price paid and she loved it.
4.0,Decent pair of sunglasses for the money. Lenses scratch fairly easily.
4.0,For my daughter very comfortable and the length is perfect for her tiny frame.
4.0,"Fit well, chiffon like fabric. I wear 40 DD and fit comfortably through chest."
4.0,"Doesn’t glow in the dark but otherwise, great!"
4.0,Very stylish shirt. Looks great with jeans!
4.0,"It is what it is, a pair of compressions. When I put them on they were a little big and didn’t feel as tight as I would like. I’m 5’10 and I bought a medium expecting it to add pressure. Don’t get me wrong, they feel nice and are comfortable. They’re mostly used for basketball and they cool me down and feel like a second skin. I would buy again."
4.0,Quality of glasses are great. Fit snugly on face. Great polarized vision.
4.0,My Kid looks cute in these.  Thank you.
4.0,"The belt quality is very good. It looks nice and fits a wide variety of sizes because you size the belt yourself...which is easy because it has size markings on the back to indicate where to cut. The buckle also looks really nice. I think it was rubbing on the box during shipping or something because it had some light scuffing on one portion of it...not a big deal. No one can see it because no one better be getting that close to my belt. The only downside to the belt is that the buckle itself is a little too thick. it kind of hangs out a little more than I would like, but I think that is a result of the ratchet style and the thickness of the actual belt. I wear polo shirts a lot which I keep loose to cover the top thickness of the buckle, so it works out okay. Suggestions for improvement would be to reduce the belt thickness so you can reduce the buckle thickness. If that was taken care of, the belt would be perfect."
4.0,This was bought to accompany a gift which will be given at Christmas
4.0,It’s not too attractive 🤪but will be so much better in the hot summer.  I’m really tired of poly bras that are like saunas.  Wish there were more all cotton bras on the market.  I will bought two more. Wish it was prettier though.
4.0,"The bag for the phone could be more bigger for 5.5p devices but, except that this belt is perferct"
4.0,"They bend a bit too much for my liking, but otherwise they're great. The lenses don't scratch easily, and they're super cute."
4.0,"Love the shoes, the shipping took WAY longer than expected"
4.0,"Pros: The Dress fit as expected, the color is nice and yes the material does stretch somewhat, but spandex it is not.<br /><br />Cons: The buttons on the back could have been better sown as they didn't close properly at first until I had them adjusted myself.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with my purchase and would buy another."
4.0,good value for a good product<br />Legs feel great
4.0,Hood is a weird style so when i turn right i have hood all in my face
4.0,Great feel and material. Could have done without the lace.
4.0,The shoe sixing is a little bit big ..I ordered and 8.5 but I should of gone with an 8 . I have large calves and the measurements that were given for this boot it would of been big but it is not ...its a tad tight around ...
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and 175 lbs. I take a large or extra-large. But this was a bit larger than expected, and because the fabric is a little stiff, like linen, it didn't drape well. So I sent it back and ordered a 16, which is a better fit, though still a bit large.<br /><br />This dress, or shift, is well-made. It washed well, and didn't bleed much. But I am not as likely to wear it as some other Zanzea styles, because the fabric is a bit stiff and dull. Less flowy and soft. For comparison, the &#34;Ladies Solid Round Neck Two-layer A-line Baggy Vintage Long Maxi Dress&#34;  drapes nicely, and the fabric feels almost like a slubbed raw silk. It has the same slight sheen, but is very soft and airy, and feels wonderful."
4.0,Good that for the price
4.0,"Beads are nice. the only problem are the pull strings, they become loose on their own and are rather thin."
4.0,"The earrings are great. I like them and they actually are pretty decent. Unfortunately, I do not know if they rust or not because I avoid water most of the time but so far they are not rusting or showing any signs. They fit well and are a good size and do not weigh the ear down. Only complaint is that I received this item about 2 and a half  weeks after ordering but the seller compensated me with some other goodies(which weren't really appealing to me but nonetheless I appreciate their compensation). Overall, the earrings are what you expect them to be.e"
4.0,"A very good belt,  fits a large man or woman well. The buckle is simple old style rustic and charming. The leather is fairly firm and can pinch a bit at times. This is more of a casual belt than a dress up belt"
4.0,Good quality shirt and really cute.  Only issue was that I ordered a Large but it fits like a small.  But still cute - just had to give it to someone else who wears a small.
4.0,this is really a very nice robe.  Comfortable and plush.  Does run large so the s/m fit me quite well.  Great for the price.
4.0,The shirt is fine. The price doesn’t match but it’s a good shirt just for a casual day or to wear around the house.
4.0,"Great Wallet. Actually smells good. (Like leather) My Galaxy S3 with a case on it, does NOT fit in the zipper portion. It's the reason I bought it. The snap on the side is a little hard to line up after filling it with cards. (Darn). Over all not bad. Very pretty and looks exactly like the picture."
4.0,"Cute dress, good price."
4.0,"So I work at a shoe store that sells the actual Jibbitz and there is a definitely quality gap here. However, I figured that would be the case when I ordered them and that's why I did this for my toddler as he wanted to be like brothers and sisters and at 4.99 a piece the actual jibbitz get expensive. Haha these served the purpose tho and he loves all the options with them. My teenager even grabbed a few despite them not being the actual jibbitz!"
4.0,"a little stretch, fabric feels a little heavy, but color is beautiful"
4.0,Excellent gift fit shoe
4.0,Good material & design. Fit is larger than standard size.
4.0,Nice material although runs small
4.0,Gorgeous earrings!  Got them as a gift from my husband and I LOVE them!  They have a little more weight to them than other earrings I own but not uncomfortable to wear for a few hours at a time.
4.0,This dress is worth the money..Like this dress...
4.0,Weird fit size up and if you have thighs and big butt it don’t fit right
4.0,"I really like the personalized wallet, the color is a litter different than I expected."
4.0,Beautiful watch. Nice finish and jeeps good time
4.0,These are the real thing.  The size is big.
4.0,Runs large. Very soft.
4.0,"I got this in a size Medium although I am a small, it was the smallest size they had. Wish they had a small for the amount I paid because he Medium is really frumpy on me. You can see in the picture I don't look like the XS / S that I am. Nothing flattering going on here.<br />Wouldn't buy it again just because it's the same quality as a $20 jacket but the price is jacket up. I'm happy I have it, but I wouldn't do it again.<br />It's too big, basic quality, and way too expensive.<br />It does look EXACTLY like the picture so that's where the 4 stars come from. I thought it would be thicker for the price but it's just another thin jacket that's soft on the inside."
4.0,Love it !  Bit daring though! I would like just a bit more coverage for the boobs.
4.0,Very nice watch keep good timing a lot of compliment.
4.0,Nice fitting sock.  Well cushioned and comfortable.
4.0,The olor was not as brilliant as the picture but its a nice top
4.0,did not fit my wrist but easy to read
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty, but the stones were too big for my taste.  I gave them to my mom and she loves them.  It's my fault because I was unsure of the size, but the earrings themselves are very nice."
4.0,fit is a bit small
4.0,"Not as large as I thought they may be, but cute nonetheless. Exactly what I was hoping for. Highly recommended."
4.0,"I love this dress! I ordered it in an XL and it fits but it's a little snug, not in a bad way. I'm keeping it b/c I feel like it'll stretch but I'm going to order the red a size up to compare. Nice fabric, very versatile dress. I'm buying all the colors."
4.0,Daughter wears it every day.
4.0,If it has individual chain for each key that will be perfect. Overall it is a good product
4.0,These glasses are priced low and your bound to be noticed.  They are by far the cheapest glasses I own and one my favorites.  I am an adult male and they fit my head perfectly.  Great thing is that if I lose or break these they are priced so low that it's no biggie to replace.<br /><br />One negative is that they say zeroUV on BOTH sides which is a bit obnoxious.  That is why it lost a star.  Over all great deal.
4.0,It's alil bit on the thin side but makes it great for summer . It is also super soft and has a U shaped neck so you don't feel like your wearing a turtle neck (like many non V neck shirts for woman do). Over all pretty good
4.0,"Now I can actually use the bps on rear. Old case partially blocked it. all buttons are easy to use. case a little thinner than old case but easier to operate buttons and just as tough in drops. Colors are great also. For the price, can't be beat."
4.0,Love this shirt. Material is great and fits so nicely. Very sexy and comfortable.
4.0,I paired this tunic with leggings and felt like I was wearing pjs to work. I received several compliments and felt great all day. The material is very soft. I am 5'3&#34; and 113 and purchased the small for fit reference.
4.0,"If you have back fat, it hides it well. Not form fitted. Cute top. Got a lot of compliments."
4.0,El vestido es cómodo y fija bien. No le doy cinco estrellas porque los colores  no se ven como en la foto.
4.0,"Fits my little ones feet well, she seems to like them very much."
4.0,Picture is pretty accurate. The back is hollow. Be warned.
4.0,Very nice shirt fits well and is very comfortable I would recommend highly to everyone who asks about thus shirt
4.0,I got  size S for a 5'4&#34; & 118 lbs body. Cute top. I got 2 (this and a blue floral one).
4.0,Fantastic. Beautifully done. It would have been nice to know how it looked on a model.
4.0,Like this purse so far. Love the color.
4.0,"Great boots!!! They fit to size and are really comfortable. My only complaint is I bought them for 11b mosq school and all the rocks from the 12 mile ruck march took chunks out of the rubber. Probably won't last as long as I wish they would, but I would buy another pair."
4.0,"It came in a plastic bag, and was smashed. I saw so much wrinkles  (it will not go away by just hung up the coat). I had to use a steam iron to get read of the bad look. Other than that - this item fits as described and it is as described on the website. No question about what you get for the price you pay."
4.0,It works for me even though it is a bit large.
4.0,"I searched for days for the perfect ""mountain necklace"" for my sister for Christmas. I found several I liked, but they looked so fake, especially the chain. I wasn't 100% set on this one, but figured I would give it a shot and ordered it. I was pleasantly surprised. Much better quality than I expected. The chain looks a little cheap, but can be easily changed. I would definitely purchase one for myself."
4.0,"Runs large. I ordered my usual size (medium) and wish i would have sized down to a small! Other than that, a nice bra for a great price"
4.0,The fit is as expected and very flattering! The only thing I didn’t care for was the material. It’s more of a nylon.
4.0,"These shorts are very nice, well made and look good. Thick enough not to be see-through. But, they run small and unfortunately they didn't have a larger size. I plan to return them."
4.0,"I bought 2 pairs for both of my boys, my oldest son they fit perfectly for him. The other one they were a snug fit. That was after I bought a size bigger than what he wears."
4.0,Cheap and stylish
4.0,"I Love these glasses, I've been looking for this style for a while now, i finally found them, I love the fit and very stylish"
4.0,I bought these for work to keep my feet warm in my steel toed shoes. They have performed as expected.<br /><br />They washed up well and have held up to several long days on my feet.<br /><br />The run just a wee bit small…but stretch out when worn.<br /><br />Overall…not bad.
4.0,Fits perfect but too short.  I'm 5'8.
4.0,I loveeeeee it!!! As a thicker girl I thought I'd need one size bigger than normal but I should've just stayed with the regular size I wear. Other than that I love it. Thanks.
4.0,I wear between a small and medium. I have been ordering medium lately because some of the shirts have shrunk. After washing this shirt it is still roomy.  I suggest ordering a size up if you want it to flow a bit.
4.0,It came earlier than expected and the size fit very nicely. One thing that threw me off was the color of the side but otherwise i liked this a lot.
4.0,I recomend this
4.0,Love these slides as they do just what intended. We use for t shirts although the only negative is they are slippery & have a tendency to slide down. If they had little ‘teeth’ to grab the fabric it’d be perfect. Appreciate the variety of colors AND sizes. Pic is large size shown. My 8 yo loves the small size.
4.0,"This jacket looks good but it doesn't really fit. It is fine in the shoulders and chest and the sleeves are actually an inch, or so longer than I need, but the midsection is too tight to be really comfortable.  I can get it on but it feels too tight in the torso when I sit down. If you are a weight lifter, this is a perfectly proportioned jacket, but I, alas, am not a weight lifter, so it isn't as comfortable on me as I prefer. The design is really nice. I like the color, the location of the pockets and the sturdy zipper, so if you can find the right size, you should like it fine."
4.0,"They’re cute, but too big for my daughter feet.  They’re pretty chunky shoes, I’m kind of afraid she’ll trip over them when they do fit."
4.0,The fit changes but quality good
4.0,"Beautiful, nice material, quickly shipped, but way too small....runs very small by at least 2 sizes. Sent back and received prompt refund."
4.0,Love them however the only thing is the little loop that connects them. I have to keep attaching but I had my man squeeze it real tight and have not had the issue again.
4.0,Band is perfect expect keepers wont stay<br /> They're way to loose. Probably going to have to do some leather work on my own. Thought of returning and ordering another but now they're out of the style I ordered.
4.0,"So I do think the fit is spot on, keeping in mind these are women’s sizes and not juniors, so don’t worry about sizing up for pajama comfort. The material seems pretty comfy. And it’s a cute little Halloween pajama party set.<br /><br />One complaint: the hands printed on the pajama top are toddler sized. That’s just not sexy.<br /><br />Cute idea but you get what you pay for. If you’re less picky than I am, you’ll love this set."
4.0,Real nice key chain
4.0,"Cheap and cute. Took a while, but it's here."
4.0,Looks well made but easy to modify off needed the only thing I don't like is the crosses
4.0,"Very comfortable, washed great."
4.0,Poquito grande debajo de los brazos
4.0,Will use this as a wrap
4.0,"I usually wear large in dresses but there wasn't any available, therefore I bought the XL."
4.0,"They are great they wash up nicely. A little tight for a slightly chunky baby who is in the 97% of height, but they work."
4.0,Great flip flops for girls.
4.0,They are both beautiful
4.0,"love this bag, the only reason I have given it 4 stars is because of the long strap. There should be a way to fasten the strap at the ends of the bag."
4.0,"Usually I wear between a medium and a large, I read the other reviews & decided to order an XL. Fit fine, since it’s made of 100 percent cotton, I think after washing it’ll be perfect. Nice and comfortable too."
4.0,I love this necklace and have received a lot of compliments on it but it smells like cheap metal. My skin is sensitive to metals but isn't irritated at all...just a funky smell (up close).
4.0,"This fit true to size. It is a silky, stretchy material. My only complaint is the color. The blue on the listing is much darker than the actual color I received"
4.0,"Dress is really nice! However the sizing is LARGE. I normally on Amazon wear a 2XL, but when I ordered a 2XL on these dresses it was hanging off of me and was way too long. I'm 200 lbs, 4'11. It was hanging off my shoulders and all the way down to my mid calves. I'm guessing most are going to be like that, however for the price, I can afford to get it hemmed.<br /><br />Still I'll be attempting to order a size or two smaller because the dress is exactly what I wanted. It doesn't feel like the price says - it's great quality and looks super nice!"
4.0,"I took a chance when I ordered this hoodie because the title said it was a full zip--meaning a jacket and not a pullover as pictured. However, I figured it was as pictured and I am correct. I did ask Amazon to make the adjustment to the title to reflect the picture.<br /><br />This hoodie is soft, warm, and plush. I have no idea how it will hold up to washing as I have not laundered it yet. The arms are a bit long and it is loose on me because I ordered a 2XL since an XL was not available but I consider it true to size.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with my purchase so far and will update my review if anything changes after laundering. The current price of $44.99, which is what I paid for it, is pricey but is still about the going rate for hoodies these days."
4.0,I loved this Coach Satchel in 3 colors. It is even more amazing than the picture. The colors are very vibrant and size is just perfect.
4.0,I was surprised at how cute this was in person. Love the pockets. The fabric is a tiny bit tougher than what I expected though
4.0,"It’s a cute jacket wears as shown in photo of item. Fits as expected. It’s a very basic jacket. No tag, nothing to show product manufacturer or designer. No “ label”. It’s definitely a wardrobe staple."
4.0,It's a really cute shirt but it was too large. I sent it back.
4.0,"I love these because they don’t fit too tight around my head. No headaches from these. They do hold. They may need elastic replacement at very bottom soon, as the elastic stretched fairly soon, on one I wore a lot. These headbands were much prettier than I expected, and for the price. Cost is cheap, they do look a bit upscale.<br />Note: I do have a larger head, and many headbands feel too tight. Not these."
4.0,"Gloves fit well, they're a bit thicker than seen in the stock images but still sharp looking. The wool lining really keeps your hands warm, but they can also get itchy if you have sensitive skin."
4.0,They kept me dry!!
4.0,"This was more a salmon color than pink. Bag is functional, but not thrilled about the color."
4.0,Dosemt fit my 2 year old son. :/ isnt for a kid umder 5. But they are really good glasses
4.0,"Shirt is cute, but fits smaller than I’d like."
4.0,"This bag is exactly what I expected, the same color you see in the pictures and the same size. There is enough space to carry your tablet and cellphone, there are also some other compartments that used to carry my watch, jewelry and even snacks!<br />It has a funny smell, but it's not actually strong, it's kind of leather smell. A little issue is that the silver coating on the main zipper closure was missing in a spot. The shoulder strap should be thicker, but for me, that's acceptable.<br />To conclude, it looks pretty elegant and the faux leather looks pretty natural. I like it very much."
4.0,"So I’ll start by saying that the quality of this watch is pretty good for the price. It has a solid and sleek feel to it, the links are fairly easy to remove, the pin tool and the pins for each link are more durable than I expected. Resetting the date/time is easy. Not to mention the package arrived after 2 days so that’s a plus. My only complaint with the watch is that the one I received has a small defect with the “1” line (see picture). Other than that I would give this 5 stars and I do recommend getting one"
4.0,"I really love this top. The fit is decent (though I will say it runs a bit small, especially when trying to cover the bust!) and the material is super comfortable and stretchy. The body portion is NOT see-through and the length is great, even for someone like me who has a larger torso.<br /><br />The reason I knocked a star off of this item is that with the way it wraps it wouldn't naturally cover my bust in any decent way and not show even a low-cut demi bra (I'm a 38 D or 38DD for reference), so I'd either have to wear a tank under it (which I've done and it still looks fantastic) or really sew/pin the bust to keep from sliding open. I have a wider waist so that contributed to pulling the overlay further apart, so if you're very trim, you may not have the same issue.<br /><br />I also didn't like the true wrap form where I had to pull one of the sashes through a hole in the blouse because I could actually see skin where the hole was when wrapped, so I ended up putting it on and pinning the sash where it would go through the hole and sewing the sash to the hole. I also sewed up the chest overlap at the bust where I had pinned it. Even without being able to &#34;undo&#34; the sash, I was able to get the blouse on and off relatively easily due to the stretch. I plan on actually sewing the wrap further so that I don't have to route the hidden portion of sash behind my back (I will sew the end of the shirt where the sash begins to where it would connect with the outer wrap) and cut the sash off so I don't have that awkward pull of the sash around my waist (it's not terribly uncomfortable because of the great fabric, but I have a bit of belly fat it accentuates and I'd rather not have that cinch under the back of the blouse).<br /><br />If none of that made sense (it might once you actually try it on), then just know that this is a well-made blouse that is absolutely beautiful and wearable by a lot of body types if you know how to sew a bit :) Otherwise, if you have a larger bust and a wider midsection, it might be a bit tough to keep closed properly.<br /><br />I purchased both the beige/tan and the turquoise and both are stunning, maybe a tad darker than pictured, but overall they look like the photos."
4.0,"Love the color and the sequin but if not careful the sequin gets tangled with my hair when putting it on and taking it off. Over all, love it! :-)"
4.0,Wow these glasses are amazing..you get what you pay for
4.0,Many of the stones were not stuck in place. They did refund my money.
4.0,"Great material! Will roll up when sitting, Idk if its due to my thick thighs or if this is just something that happens. It's exactly what I wanted to prevent chaffing though. Fits great under dresses."
4.0,"Fantastic looking bow tie, although it is elastic and is hard to get to a right adjustment. When I wear this bow tie, I get so many kind comments!"
4.0,"This dress was mostly great... Except that the bust area is far to large. I'm debating if I want to attempt to alter it or return it. I love the cut, but the top part just doesn't fit right."
4.0,"Love this bag! It’s durable, roomy, and well made. Perfect size for overnight travel. It is lined and has one zippered pocket and two medium regular pockets inside. Side end pocket large enough for a water bottle. Nice adjustable cross body carrying strap and durable handles.  My only complaint would be that it doesn’t zip completely shut on top-it has like a 3” gap on either side of the zipper, so most things would stay in the bag, but it could have the potential for smaller things to fall out (which I didn’t see in the pictures)....but the bag is durable, cute, and the perfect size, so not a huge drawback. I just added a small piece of Velcro on each end for piece of mind."
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised. Good shirt for the price!<br />Thanks!
4.0,I loved the design of the dress.  It looks and fits comfortably.  There are pockets on both sides that are nice and deep.  The dress was a bit large (I ordered a medium). Having the sash helped to draw in the extra fabric.  Since the material is light it is perfect for warmer months
4.0,"Es bonito, pero la tela es muy fina"
4.0,Looks quite flattering
4.0,Many compliments !!
4.0,I found it too small for me but a friend saw it and now has it. She uses it for when the go 4-wheeler  mudding to keep their phones and wallets handy but protected.
4.0,Shoes are very comfortable and fit to size.
4.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old Granddaughter.  It is the perfect size and the quality seems very good.  I won't know if it stands the test of time until she has a chance to wear it for a while, hence the 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,Overall good quality but might be a good idea to order a size bigger.
4.0,"Nice dress, very appropriate for professional setting. Can be worn alone or under a blazer."
4.0,"For the price this is a nice shirt. Very thin material, but it arrived sooner than expected no issue with the service. It is a comfortable top and fits as I thought it would."
4.0,"Without a tag it's hard to tell the difference between the front and back of the shirt.<br />Nice thin material, perfect for summer."
4.0,Heavy plastic smell. Does disappear if washed woth warm water and dishsoap and allowed to air dry.
4.0,These are pretty and catch the light. I love the brighter colors but several are very pastel and don't really show up that well.
4.0,This dress is amazing for the price. Just for reference I usually wear xl and size 14 jeans I ordered an xl and it fit perfect.. except for one thing. The chest part is a little to small so if you don't mind showing a little cleavage or if you have a small chest it should be fine.
4.0,"Value for price is good, it has come off the fit bit a few times but it seems better now.  It looks good and feels comfortable"
4.0,"need longer torso, well made"
4.0,Looks nice. The prongs slip out sometimes and the watch falls off.
4.0,"I got an amazing free tote at a health fair and tried looking for a similar tote online that was classier but still lightweight and waterproof. I don't like heavy leather bags. I found this and love the patterns, however it doesn't stand up straight on its own like my free tote does and the base is not as wide so I can't fit as much in it compared to my free tote. I can fit a laptop and a binder in my free tote but can only fit a laptop and nothing else in this tote with the zipper closed. Would pay more for a wider tote."
4.0,"I have wanted a luckenbooth for a long time. When I came across this one on Amazon, I thought it was great. Why only 4 stars? On the good side, the pin is well made. The actual luckenbooth is thick and strong and so is the pin that you will use to attach the brooch to your garment. I am currently using this as a decorative touch on a plain purse. The pin pierced both the purse fabric and the purse's interior liner with no problem, and it is attached very securely. The downsides? 1) There is no bale or loop on the luckenbooth so that you can wear it as a pendant. This was mentioned in the description, and I though that was convenient that I could wear the brooch two different ways. The product's description is incorrect -  there is no bale or loop for a necklace to pass through. 2) The luckenbooth is not shiny whatsoever. From the pictures, it looks very shiny like sterling silver. I am not sure where the &#34;silver plating&#34; comes in here, but mine is the color of pewter. Now, pewter has a tendency to blacken when tarnished, and this pin is made of very bright pewter. I did polish it when it arrived, and there was no tarnish. But it is not shiny like silver at all. I like the brooch very much, but I am disappointed that it is not shinier. I wanted others to be aware of these facts before purchase."
4.0,Great customer service. Had to get another sweater and they replaced it and shipped it free of charge. I do like the accent on the back. The quality isn't mint but the garment does stand out
4.0,"Great looking hoodie....expected more of a coffee color...mine looks purple ish, no biggie!<br />Definitely go up a size!"
4.0,Great Birthday gift - went beautifully with the Weeping Angel Necklace
4.0,Very comfy socks with grippers to wear safely around the house on hardwood floors. Cute and cozy!
4.0,My best friend loved getting this for her birthday
4.0,It's a nice earring for the price and is as exactly as shows. It's also not too heavy but the earrings are too big. If the earrings were the tikka size it would be more wearable for me
4.0,"high quality, high end looking watchband. looks pretty expensive for the price. I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing a watch strap for an expensive watch."
4.0,Like this.  Will work perfectly with my dress that has a low back.
4.0,"feels lightweight, good for layering as the fabric is kind of thin as a dress.  sleeves are very long"
4.0,I love this key chain... I was at work and a customer had one so I took a picture of it and Google it and found it and purchased myself one .. I love the Verse and the colors...
4.0,These are super cute but the color does run off the knees after just a couple wears.
4.0,"REally cool chelsea boot, it even comes with a couple of spare lifts!  Problem is I have wide feet and one shoe didn't fit me properly so it would have been agonizing long term.  I would recommend them, they come from jolly old  England"
4.0,Fits nicely but it feels a bit worm sometimes
4.0,"Love the shirt. Nicely made. Very comfortable. However I ordered a size bigger then normal, and its to big. But still looks great with skinny jeans. Arrived in 2 days."
4.0,It’s a beautiful bag. Seems to be sturdy.
4.0,This is a nice light weight shirt. Good for fishing or being on the water. I got the bass logo on mine but the trees in the picture shown are not on my shirt. Its not a big deal because the shirt looks nice without it.
4.0,"Good.,,"
4.0,Fell in love with this watch! Only wish is that it was waterproof...sadly I forgot to take it off at the beach and killed it within the first week.
4.0,"This is really cute, and I get a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"I bought this hat in December 2015 and am pretty happy with the overall aesthetic. I would like to point out that the color is actually more of a baby pink than it is a &#34;rose.&#34; Either way, I'm definitely getting lots of compliments :)"
4.0,Kinda cheap looking but okay
4.0,only a few fit my fingers and if it did it was only my pinky
4.0,"The purple color of this jumpsuit is so beautiful! However the large was snug and the fabric is so unforgiving - so every dimple, wrinkle and roll is accented. I didn’t have time to exchange for an XL or else I absolutely would have kept this."
4.0,Beautiful dress fit perfect.
4.0,more comfortable wearing a slip under it.
4.0,Love these shorts!! So comfortable and not super short.
4.0,It is a part of an outfit that I’m wearing to a dance and it makes to outfit a lot cuter! It would be cool if there were more sizes but I will make do!
4.0,"Fit great, very comfortable.  I ordered a Men's Large and it has a Woman's zipper on it, (pull on the left side) and very flimsy. Do I return it or do I have it replaced myself?"
4.0,Nice quality exactly what I was looking for
4.0,Super belt!! I highly recommend and I’m picky!!!
4.0,Loved it for my chunky 2month old she can still grow into it and cute to match any of her dresses and bummies. Lots of compliments good material
4.0,"Comfortable, fits well"
4.0,So comfortable and beautiful.  Comfortable to sleep in also.
4.0,Nice top I'm 5' 280 lbs bought a 4x really big on me. I love the length covers my big belly. Would buy again in my actual size 3x.
4.0,Product was delivered on time. It was just too small and then shrunk even more.
4.0,"Works well but the buckle is a let down. I've had this product now for 6 weeks and wear it at least six days a week.  The leather belt itself is great it seems durable and even though I use a hook that you attach to your belt to clip your keys on the belt just has a slight indentation from consistent use of the hook. No scratching at all is noticeable on leather.<br /><br />My main gripe with this belt is the attachable buckle itself. While the ratchet style functionality of this belt works great, no problems there. The actual face of the buckle is prone to easily being scratched. In no time at all that black surface can be scuffed up if you are not careful when leaning up against anything.<br /><br />If your buckle is going to be covered by a shirt you may getaway with minimal or no scratching but if you tend to wear your shirts tucked into your pants like I do, showing the belt buckle, scratches will occur if you are constantly resting against hard objects. I wear mine to work and I have to be consistently leaning up on hard objects to reach something or may have something scratch the buckle while lifting. As a result I had to ding this belt one star.<br /><br />This was my first purchase of this type of belt and they are quite a few different buckles you can try so I will be purchasing a few other ratchet style type of buckles and see how they stand up. To see whether its the norm with them all or it depends on which one you might buy."
4.0,"I brought this dress to wear to my grandmothers 90th birthday party.  It hid my tummy very well and is runs true to size.  I couldn't have asked for a better dress at this price.  Its also easy to clean, just toss in the washer on the delicate cycle."
4.0,"Its the perfect size and shape, the black isnt pure black like I expected, but overall I am happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Update Sept 2021: I still have this band. I did remove it once it became a bit itchy, however I think that was my own skin sensitivity. Happened across it and have been wearing it instead of the standard rubber band. Sure, a few threads have come out, but it isn't fraying and looks for the most part like it did day 1. Just wash it and care for it like anything else.<br /><br />I have had this band for months now, and while it is certainly more worn down than before, it still holds up and is mostly comfortable. However, I have small wrists and this is quite tight. It leaves a bit of a mark when I remove the watch, which lets me feel secure about not losing my Fitbit. I have lost some dexterity in my fingers, so this slide-on/off band has made a small but challenging issue a non-issue. Cute band. Just know, it runs tight.<br /><br />Also, it did get lost in the mail for about 3 weeks. Not sure which side this is on, however be warned the item may take time to arrive."
4.0,"I love this sweatshirt! I wish it came in more colors because I would love a black one. It’s easily my new favorite. The material is so soft and high quality, I feel this is a little dressier than I imagined (for a zip up hoodie). More like a zip up sweater. I ordered another similar priced lightweight cotton and wish I had two of these instead. The metal covers on the aglets both fell off in the wash but the actual aglets are still there, the covers just looked nicer (the only reason it is 4 stars vs 5). So far, it’s been washing and drying in normal cycles just fine. I really do love this. I ordered a L for a comfier lounge feel (usually a M) and it’s nice a loose but still fitted."
4.0,"I got an extra large because I didn't know how the sizes run, but it fit well."
4.0,Color was a bit off from picture. Not as vibrant. Otherwise it’s a cute comfy shirt
4.0,Very pretty. Mom loved them
4.0,Love this watch. Color is beautifull numbers are large and easy to read and fits just right.
4.0,"Came neatly packed. The jewelry is almost same as in the picture. The quality of the product is very good. The jewelry is very thick metal, no chance of breaking.<br />The hooks as well are very strong, should last long.<br />I have not noticed any fading or peeling until now."
4.0,I think this outfit is cute for costumes but the fabric isn't that good.
4.0,Thank u for the cool  necklace
4.0,"This is a great jacket - lightweight, yet warm enough for temps in the 50s.  Having read the reviews that the jacket runs small, I ordered a large, one size up for me.  The large still is snug, and I would not be able to wear a warm sweater underneath it comfortably.  I returned the jacket."
4.0,I’m 5’10” and this dress was about 8 inches too short for me.
4.0,It works great and the power reserve lasted longer than expected.  The band and casing were perfect. The 24 hour clock gets stuck occasionally but no big deal.
4.0,Works well for toddler glasses.  Comfortable and stays put.
4.0,I bought this jacket for my 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas. When I opened the package I thought it would be too small. She is about average size for her age. I got the size 7-8 and it fit perfect. It's a very nice looking coat.
4.0,"My 3YO just loves Spiderman and was super happy with these gloves.  It's a bit big for him - maybe looks to fit a 4/5YO about right - but he didn't care.  If your child loves Spiderman, they won't either.  Durable and will work well with a Spiderman Halloween costume."
4.0,"WEAR M GOT L FITS LIKE LEGGINGS BUT CUTE ME ,,,BODY SHAPE MAKES A DIFFERANCE"
4.0,I haven't use it yet but it looks just like the picture. I was hopping it was a little bigger but this size will do.
4.0,I have AMD and the sunglasses work great thank you
4.0,Work well - strong magnets.
4.0,Very cute but WAY too small - couldn't even dream of getting it over my shoulders.
4.0,Great Episcopal Mask
4.0,"Good warm earmuffs, at an excellent price.  They do not obstruct hearing. A little odd shaped to keep on the arm when not in use but good fit when wearing."
4.0,"Great design. I hope theirs a longer length tho. At 5'10  170lbs&#34;  It looks too long, but it's great on my 210lb neighbor 5'10 the pendant sits right under his chest."
4.0,"The product shipped quickly and is as described in the description. However the flap that contains the filter easily flips up out of the mask blocking the range of sight. This was bought for my son and he said he a face mask with ear loops is more comfortable for him. Nice quality, but will not buy anymore."
4.0,I bought a pair for self and gift for friend were still wearing every day. They are small but still noticeable and attractive. Love them.
4.0,"I really like these beads. They have the best dragon design, of the beads/charms that I viewed. They are as advertised, and will work great for my project. The only reason I don't give 5 stars, is because shipping takes so long. It comes directly from the overseas seller, so it takes about 2wks to get it. I haven't decided if this will be a deal breaker for re-ordering."
4.0,I wear this dress mainly at work so I wear leggings under it. This creates a bit of static cling. Although I don't know if this is just a matter of the legging fabric.
4.0,I love these for wearing under dresses. They DO NOT shape you and run kinda big.
4.0,This is actually a perfect pin I love it
4.0,"Super cute, easy on and off for my 2 year old but they are big...probably .5-1 size too big so they'll have to wait a little while to wear them."
4.0,The pants are neat and stylish.
4.0,Small.. Love the quote on inside
4.0,"These are not exactly what I wanted. They are ok, the ones I received dont have that beautiful blue iridescent sheen. They are nicely polished, the size is perfect for wire wrapping. They have a good energy. They are pearly white and beautiful."
4.0,I really really really really love this it was a great piece would recommend to anyone for purchase. Please purchase
4.0,"I love them, but they are defective, but they are otherwise awesome.  I will order another pair.  They have a misprint.  If you are a LuLaroe fan, spend your money here.  Great price, really cool!<br />Recieved my replacement today.  PERFECT!!!!!!"
4.0,The dress is a stretch material and it's light. There are some stitching errors but nothing major. The dress is pretty and wears comfortable.
4.0,Loved it.. Works as advertised
4.0,"The craftsmanship on this is spectacular, but it is rather large. It comes woth its own piece to attach your keys to and it's easy to hold. I love this thing."
4.0,"Simply stunning. I purchased a LARGE, but for better drama on the split, I should have bought a Medium (5’2”, 163lbs). Nice flow and good color."
4.0,"The colors are very vivid! I really like it.  Fits well, nice and comfortable!"
4.0,For working out great fit
4.0,Used as pho
4.0,Pretty large earrings but they’re cute it’s a colorful orange top. Go for the fashion statement with genuine leather.
4.0,"Pretty. I got the pink/blue one. Color is very close to the picture, deep waist, goes above the belly button. Small is European small, I'd say American extra small. Very comfortable. A bit sheer. The only thing is it reminds me of pajamas. That's why 4 stars."
4.0,They are super comfy but are a little big on me.
4.0,My 2 attempt to seek a pair of gloves that are long enough to keep the draft from entering my jacket .<br />They are warm and fashionable<br />But not long enough for it's purpose<br />I will just go to a store to find the length that's needed<br />The size chart isn't addressing it's wrist coverage<br />And large will be too long in fingers lenght I'm sure<br /><br />If u don't ride on a bike and don't need full protection in outdoor exsposure with no barrier<br />Than these are great to buy<br /><br />Needing that blocked connection to jacket
4.0,I like the bra.  I  did order  42G.  Normal size is 40G.  It d8d 5ake awhile to arrive
4.0,"The dress is very pretty I got the size I will normally get on a fancy dress like this a 16 and it didn't zip up I suggest getting one size bigger just in case. Also, if your short like me it will be too long but that's no problem it can be fixed by a taylor. Edit: so I reorder this dress in dusty pink size 18 and it fit a bit big on me but that wasn't a problem I also got the long part fixed and added a cute belt it looked super cute for my senior prom!"
4.0,"Seems a bit on the fragile side material wise. That said, it's otherwise amazing! Perfect for what I need. Not too big, not too small."
4.0,"Not exactly the shape that I was hoping for, but they're much better quality than what I thought they would be."
4.0,"The waist didn't stay straightened it crimpled up (don't know how to describe it lol) may have been too big. I got an XL I'm 216 lbs, 5'10""... my measurements are 40 34 48. The large would have been a better fit for me. The material is nice"
4.0,Fiance loves the necklace
4.0,Nice velvety material. Wig could be thicker. Not bad for price.
4.0,I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the fact that I had to iron it.  Should have known since it was cotton.
4.0,I returned the dress as the fit was a bit snug on me. The construction of the dress looked well made.I wish it would have fit as it was a cute dress with a nice cut on it!
4.0,"Cute, comfortable and fit as expected."
4.0,Good quality sunglasses. Enjoying with it. Worth the price.
4.0,"I like the size it was perfect, my only problem was the glitter was coming off easily."
4.0,nice earrings for the price.. got two pairs gave my sister one as a xmas gift!
4.0,Fits great . wish I could have selected different. Top size cause its too big. But other than that. I was shocked that it fits like it does for the price..
4.0,"Cute costume jewelry. Came with extra clasps, so that was nice. Very vibrant red. I love the option of lengths. Came well wrapped in protective packaging, however, a bead and red gem were popped off the bracelet and loose inside the box. I was able to super glue them back on, just shows how cheaply it's made. Which is exactly what I expected anyway."
4.0,"Love this dress! Was a bit large, but after a quick wash and dry it shrunk to perfection. It started pilling very quickly, though. You get what you pay for!"
4.0,Sweet. The lenses aren't as silver as in the picture. They're actually black.
4.0,"I really like these. They wear well, feel comfortable and reduce glare. And the two tone color scheme looks good. When my husband looks at me he sees a reflection in the glasses so he does not like them so much. You might want to consider that is how you will look to others sometimes. I don't mind this with all the other benefits and its a good price too. Recommend and would purchase again."
4.0,"Beautiful color, light fabric - though a little ticket then I anticipated. Docked 1 star because the neck opening is smaller than I would like. I would like more of a cowl."
4.0,The material is thinnn! Wear white underwear with it lol very comfy
4.0,Very nice looking purse I sure my friend will like it
4.0,"This dress runs quite large. It was just too big from the bust down and didn't look very flattering on me so I decided to return it.  I probably should have order it a size smaller.  Otherwise it is a nice dress, not see through at all. The fabric is soft.  Label says: Hand wash cold only."
4.0,Too big. But so cute. Was sad to return
4.0,My hubby liked it.  It took a long time to arrive but it is as described.  It looks exactly like the picture.
4.0,I got size 2-3 T and fit perfect my grandsons love them
4.0,I probably paid too much for these shirts but it got cold overnight and I was going camping the day they arrived so I kept them. I have no complaints. I have washed them and they are still good. Just too pricey. I should have shopped around first...
4.0,It’s cute and love the color
4.0,Nice sandals for the $$.  I don't know how well they will hold up.
4.0,Good quality. My daughter is tiny so I got a smaller size and wish I would've gone with her normal size cuz they were kind of short for her.
4.0,This is a descent boot for the price. Light weight and fairly comfortable the two things I least like about them tho are the grip and the size. I feel like they are pretty slick feeling on pavement. Size wise o normally wear a 11 so I got the 12 and they are almost to tight.
4.0,I am using  the scale to measure powder for reloading and works great in the grain mode. Works great for me!
4.0,Liked them!  Unique!
4.0,Decent quality. It runs very large. I get tons of compliments on it. Great buy for the price.
4.0,"The shoes are excellent, but the price is $39 higher than previous years.  ( $159 versus $120 in previous years)  The improvements are not worth $39 more to me.  Now they have 2 styles, the cheaper style sold in the $70 range and the GTX for $159.  The magnification tool in the Amazon website shows that the cheaper version does not resemble the prior versions.  The GTX does resemble the prior versions."
4.0,These are more comfortable than wearing a mask but I wouldn’t say they are “cooling”. They’re very thin material and don’t stay up great but I’ll wear them as an alternative to a mask.
4.0,"They feel cheap, but for the price, they are exactly what I wanted. I didn't think i would like them but after having them for a weekish they feel fine. Solid boot for the price. If you want a great boot that will last a long time I dont think this is right for you but if you are looking for a decent boot that is comfortable enough this boot is perfect. I'm a 10.5 and got an 11 and it fits fine.<br /><br />I got the fur ones. Not much fur. I think its about the same with or without.<br /><br />Overall not bad. Probably going to get a high end boot next year that will last but i could be wrong about these also. Just feel cheap, may last a lifetime. Time will tell."
4.0,"Comfortable pants, fit perfect"
4.0,Good graphics but hard for a young child to set time /adjust.
4.0,I am a xl and the large worked perfectly for me. It conceals and almost hides my patch. Does slide down a bit and somewhat uncomfortable at first but I think that's because it's holding things in like I need. It was worth every cent and I would recommend this over the expensive ones any day bc I have those 2.
4.0,"I ordered this maxi skirt and crop top set in black, size XL (my usual size) and it's too big for me. My measurements are 40"" bust (C cup), 34"" waist, 45"" hips and I'm 5'4"". The elastic waistband of the skit fits my waist perfectly, stays in place while I'm moving around, but the length basically hits the floor, so I can't wear it with flat sandals. The top is so incredibly big on me, it even has extra fabric after I tie it as tight as it can go. Like another reviewer suggested, I'm going to try and dry to shrink the top. I love this set because it's so comfortable, lightweight, and flowy, so I'm hoping I can make it work! (In the photos I'm wearing the croptop without a bra, I suppose if I wore it with a padded strapless one I could make it work better too...)"
4.0,"The shirt and bow were super cute , the shorts where cute too but it came without a button thats the only reason I gave it a 4 star."
4.0,"This belt is very basic.  I ordered it in black.  I can't remember what size I chose but I think it was a Medium.  I ordered based off the size chart & it fits me perfectly.  It works well, as it should, and I have no complaints.  It is plain but that means it can go with almost anything.  I don't think it will be super durable, so if you need  a belt for daily use, this might not be what you're looking for, but it will be fine for just occasional use.  It's a good accessory."
4.0,Comfortable go to. The material is light (best for temperatures between 60 degrees and above and exercising).
4.0,This is a very cute shirt and looks good on.  Do yourself a huge favor though and order it one size large than you think you need.  It does run small.  Looks best with a skirt I think due to how the waist looks.
4.0,"Super cute. Order for your bust size. The bottoms run small, but since they are adjustable ties on each side, you can make them more comfortable. That is what I did. I cliff jumped in Hawaii in this suit and no problem! However, if you are looking for full cheek coverage, this suit is not for you. Great price tho even if you just keep the top and buy a different style bottom separate to your liking."
4.0,"I normally don't buy things offline, but decided to give it a try.<br /><br />First off, I am 5'8 and weight 180 lbs. I thought that this dress would be great to hide my tummy area. It does.....BUT I would suggest ordering the size that you normally order. NO need to go up or down a size. I ordered an XL thinking that the dress would be too small based on the reviews and boy was I wrong. It is entirely too big! Luckily, I know how to sew and can adjust it myself. The fabric is okay. Not the best and not the worst. GREAT for the summer and the splits are not that long. Overall it's a nice dress, just wish I would have went with a Large XD.<br /><br />XOXO!"
4.0,Thought they were lined but I still like them
4.0,Nice scarves! Thank you!
4.0,"Polishing  gold, stainless steel, and silver, does a great job."
4.0,cute but too small :( i ordered small because that’s usually my size… so i would recommend sizing up!
4.0,Size down one size.
4.0,Smaller than expected but was able to pass it on to a smaller sister. She loved it and told me she received a lot of compliments.
4.0,Such a cute little shirt!  Runs a bit small but otherwise a great deal
4.0,I have been using this bag almost a week and have received many compliments on it. It is a little bigger than I'd hoped but I still like it. Did not have issues with smell.
4.0,"I like the earrings, but the posts are a little longer than most earrings.  I often sleep with the earrings in and these seem to &#34;poke&#34; me and wake me up.  But, wearing them during the day is fine."
4.0,"Hi, i wear a small to medium depending on material, but i got a medium since it's not a loose t-shirt.. but when i tried it on it felt a bit tight..maybe some like them like that me no.. it was to attached to my body so it's okay but going to order me a Large now and see how that fits me but other than that i like it."
4.0,"Very nice,heavier that expected."
4.0,"It is a lightweight, easy maintenance robe."
4.0,the panties are beautiful .....  unfortunately WAY too small.<br />I will return and possibly order a larger size.
4.0,"The bathing suite is cute and fits just right.  I'm a true size 14 and order the X-large and it fits perfect, I just wish it supported the breast better.  It's true, if you're large in the chest area it's not much support, but I loved it.  See photo, not bad right????"
4.0,Quality of product is really good
4.0,It is a great clutch but the metal strap weaved itself into several places of my lace dress. It took me an hour of my party to get it lose in most places and I had to actually tear the strings of my brand new dress in others.
4.0,Christmas presents for my little neices.  They loved them!
4.0,"I do like these, though they took a few wears to break them in. The first few wears I had VPLs, but after 3-4 washes they fit very well. They are snug and almost act as shape wear. I'm 5'10&#34; and 155 lbs, bought a size Large which fit though I think an XL would fit as well. Nice for the price"
4.0,Cute but won’t stay latched very well.
4.0,I probably bought the size a bit small. The only problem I have is the glare coming off the lense.
4.0,I'm 5'5 158lbs and I bought the large. The pants stretch which is awesome and covers your mid section. You shouldn't feel hot or feel like you can't move.  I absolutely loved them and this is a real no bias review!
4.0,This is made of very nice soft material..But I ordered it larger than I normally wear so it would be lose fitting…But it is not lose..I can wear it..But it does not flow and make you feel nice wearing it.. This would fit that way on a person who wears a 10-12….If you like them fitted this will be fine..
4.0,Our daughter loves all things Spider-Man. She has tons of Peter and Miles clothing but very little Gwen. She loves this hoodie. The fabric is not great and is sort of thin…it works if you are layering. But that fabric is more like a costume or outerwear and tricky to clean.
4.0,Today was my first time using the shoes for my zumba class. Very comfortable and allowed me to move my feet easier.
4.0,This gaiter is not exactly what I had expected. Though it’s soft as described and with the double layers is warm. My exception is that I had thought the pile on the inside would be super long and plush. It’s not. I’m sure it’s my mistake but not what I expected.
4.0,This is super comfortable. Although it is a bit wide at the bottom and not as form fitting as the picture would imply.
4.0,Loved it! Got a lot of compliments at work. Fits fitted & it's comfortable. You can wear it casual or formal depending on the accessories you wear with it.
4.0,"Great bag. Holds everything for day trip including gallon water, formula, clothes, diapers, wipes etc. Only wish the outside pockets were slightly bigger for quick grab."
4.0,"My hubby loves it, I can’t wait for him to wear them Christmas morning . I hope the writing stays on after washing it because most t shirts with writing have a problem staying . He loves the set though :)"
4.0,"I bought for my daughter to take to Spain and she used it every day. She said it is perfect for a debit card, room key or small amount of money. Anything bigger like cell phone or passport was too heavy and visible/obvious through the fabric and it weighed the scarf down awkwardly."
4.0,"Good fit, very comfortable and well made."
4.0,"Cool, mini yellow smiley face pin. Looks good and really pops out with color when placed against a darker setting (currently using this on a navy blue backpack). The pin's design utilizes a mosaic/tiled layout so it has a certain pixel-art quality to it."
4.0,This purse is a good size and has dividers to help keep this organized and I love the color! The only issue I have is that some of the zippers inside were broken
4.0,"You get what you pay for.  These are cute sunglasses, but the frame doesn't feel very sturdy.  The lenses are good and give you a good protection and vision, but I think the frame is not too flattering."
4.0,It's very pretty and delicate.  I just wish you could adjust the length to make is smaller.
4.0,I use tanks as a layering shirt for working out. These are a little tight and short.
4.0,It's cute but soooo short! I even bought it for Las Vegas but chickened out wearing it. My friend even thought about wearing it but felt uncomfortable with how short it was. It's pretty stiff all over and doesn't allow give so if you bend down it just comes up. I just wish there was another inch or so of fabric or a little bit of elastic in it to allow some give. I may wear it with something under it at some point.
4.0,"Adorable, bought for a Halloween costume, still plays dress up with it today. The thin plastic eye google part did fall out of one side after 1st use, I had to glue it back on."
4.0,I love the shirt and how it fit it just wasn’t the red that it showed to be in the picture and that’s the red I needed it to be for me to love it
4.0,The belt is fine but it's too small for me so wasn't very useful but it's alright quality for what it is. I'm an A3 GI but A4 belt but that's my mistake not the belts. So for what it is it's not bad
4.0,Slightly to small. This is one of the cutest suits I have ever bought.
4.0,"It's great, the color is just not bright like in the picture:("
4.0,"I had to get about a size up. Very sexy, super comfy, but had to exchange sizes."
4.0,Good product.. worth the price
4.0,Hip and fun
4.0,There are many pockets -- I wish the lining were more durable. Mine tore after wearing the cross body for about a month. This was a good buy for the money!!!!
4.0,Seems a little smaller then the pic but still very good
4.0,These are great socks. They are great on the calves but I wish the feet were a little tighter.
4.0,"Fits very nicely. The elastic is a little tight. Nice quality of material. Not exactly as I expected, but OK."
4.0,Tend to scratch easily
4.0,"Pretty material, fits as expected."
4.0,"was a little heavy but the supplier provided a couple of bobby pins, headband teeth and a short glue stick to make modifications that would help keep the horns on the head. i didn't use them because it stayed on my head just fine. worked well with my make up and i had tons of fun freaking people out. kids loved the horns. unfortunately, the horn curls ride just above the ears so i was not able to use prosthetic ears without having to super glue them on. :/ it's a bit of a hog. can't put anything else on your head/hair area that it won't compete or completely knock off. still. looking forward to next year or ... well any other excuse i can find to wear them."
4.0,This is very cute vest.
4.0,"Super cute, fits as expected!!"
4.0,"You get 40 individual finger lights. Several different colors.  Kids love them, but they are also great for adults to use to guide you at night.<br /><br />Fun stuff and cheap.<br /><br />One thing you all shoudl know -- under the Q&A the seller says these come in cardboard packs.  I got a bunch of loose lights in a plastic bag.<br /><br />Also they are NOT laser lights.  They are LED lights or something like that."
4.0,Fit as expected. And cool designs.
4.0,"would have preferred no iron, but it is a good shirt and wears well"
4.0,"Since it was too small to fit me, I can only really comment on the quality of the jersey in general.  It is made out of good quality materials, complete with sewn on name and numbers, which for the price is pretty amazing.<br /><br />It's a shame the size is too small for me, because it would have made a great workout jersey."
4.0,"Basic, no-frills leather wallet.  It was a good gift for someone who needed a wallet but not from a fancy designer."
4.0,"Washed them first, they're comfortable."
4.0,"Simple and lovely chain bracelet, very delicate looking."
4.0,"I bought the bag to use for traveling.  It's good quality and the size and pockets are exactly what I was looking for. The color is a little too orangey, I would have liked it a little more towards brown, but overall, a nice bag.  Definitely worth the price."
4.0,"Dones't look super expensive but still very nice. Pure white, which is difficult to come by and fits true to side."
4.0,"This is REALLY well made! I am surprised actually at how sturdy it feels. My only issue for giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is that I assumed &#34;foldable travel&#34; bag meant that it folded up really tiny, and it doesn't. Because it is so large, I would imagine, it can only fold up to be about the size of a book or so. I was really looking for a much thinner fabric so that we could store it in our backpacks for our trip through Europe but I think we should still be able to bring it with us. I am worried of finding a ton of amazing things and wanting to bring them home with us, so I will bring this bag just in case lol! I know, crazy, but it has worked for me in other countries so I figured I may as well just be safe. I wouldn't have any concerns about traveling with this bag, though, I think it would hold up great to the airlines notoriously rough treatment of bags."
4.0,Super cute and shiny! Good quality earring. The back is just a bit hard to screw on since it’s so small but worth it!
4.0,These clip on sunglasses are great. It came in a plastic case. It doesn't add too much weight onto your glasses like I find some other products do. I like it better than the ones that slide over your glasses because my lenses are pretty thick. These fit pretty well even if your lens are pretty thick. Just make sure you measure your own lenses to make sure it will cover over your entire lens. It does its job of protecting your eyes from sunlight. I use it mainly for just driving.
4.0,The colors are vibrant and they haven’t faded at all even after quite a few golf games and batting cage nights! The wood grain texture is just noticeable enough without looking to artificial.
4.0,"My husband always wears Large.  I bought this for him as  gift and by the time he got it, it was too late to exchange.  Really needed an XL.  Would be wise to order up a size."
4.0,Love the dual straps making it adjustable for the kids. my daughter loves them and they arent very heavy but they are sturdy
4.0,"Seems to function fine. The lenses seem to be very slightly lighter than other brands, but that can either be positive or negative.  That will be an individual preference."
4.0,"Nice fitting , and looking,can see very clear."
4.0,I got the black joggers for my bday. Loved them so much!!! Got a lot of compliments on them! Wanted to get more.  Got the olive green and was disappointed. The color was brighter than I thought.  Returned them and just ordered charcoal. Fingers crossed they look good because they are so comfy!!!
4.0,"Good for camping, swimming, etc."
4.0,Lots a room. The Velcro is ripping off the purse but thats the onpy bad part. But I've had it a year an its still on just starting to come off
4.0,The stone is huge.  Also to me It is more the color of Swiss Topaz instead of London Blue Topaz.  The chain is very nice quality.  This is a gift.
4.0,it is a nice piece of jewelry but I came a week after delivery date.
4.0,"I love this dress. It fits as expected and has a bit of stretch to it that makes it very comfortable! The only thing I don't like is the very short sleeves, but that's easily fixed with a cardigan."
4.0,I am in love with all the colors as they match different outfits. I only gave this a 4 because I would have preferred 10mm 00g as they tend to fit better with a slight flare to the ends. But these still work nice.
4.0,"I think this is the 6th jersey we've purchased from this company. Very appreciative of the extra Velcro patch they provide so shame new cert badges are received, we don't have to hunt for them. They are perfect, but I wish they offered women's cut sizing. The only remedy is to purchase youth sizing to fit my daughter without her ""looking like she's wearing a tent"" as she puts it. Otherwise, it's exactly what we needed and delivered within 3 days by a very pleasant contracted delivery driver."
4.0,Was not what I expected at all
4.0,Pretty cute wig for dress up or Halloween!
4.0,So I received this watch yesterday and so far here's what I found.Not a solar watch as described.Also it is not fluorescent as I had it in sunlight for hours and it did not glow.<br />It is a nice looking watch so if the above features don't matter order it.I'm going to keep it not worth the hassle to return for $82.00.<br />I will up date on how well it works. Update giving it four stars works well nice style ordering another in blue.
4.0,"Nice roomy bag (satchel.)  I love the divided sections so I can have a specific space to carry my tablet.  The blue was not quite the color I was expecting, but I still like it.  No defects noted. Slight smell when received enclosed in a plastic bag, however, the smell had disappeared by the next day after I place the bag on a hook in my closet."
4.0,"Earrings are okay quality...but I guess you get what you pay for!  Earrings did not arrive on a backing as pictured, they were all packed into a tiny cellophane bag inside of a small felt pouch."
4.0,"These are all beautiful!  And such a great value.  Unfortunately for me, I can't get them into my ears without pain, so I can't use them.  I have a 2g hole, so they aren't as big/stretched as some others which may be why I can't do a double-flare plug as easily.  If you can, then get these now because they are all gorgeous."
4.0,"I found the fabric of the skirt a little odd, but other than that it is a beautiful dress."
4.0,"These earrings are really beautiful; however, they are too short for the tragus piercing."
4.0,A little large. I fit in an L/XL and this top was easily an XXL size. Beautiful top though. Lovely print. Soft cotton. Maybe wear it with leggings instead of jeans or shorts?
4.0,The color is bright but the mask is just a little to big for my 4 year old.
4.0,"Cute, comfortable and easy to care for.  Keeps the sweet baby girl warm and cozy."
4.0,Wish it was a little bigger.
4.0,This hat only comes in one size and I think it should fit most women. It fit me comfortably and securely so it stayed on even in the wind. The hat has a fairly high crown and a wide brim to help protect your face from the sun. I like the tropical scarf which gives the hat a fun look for the beach.
4.0,Adorable dress. However the fabric was a bit thick for me.
4.0,Love love love!  Just be careful they're a bit flimsy and mine just recently broke :(
4.0,Very nice dress to wear to work.  The only downfall is the belt is the same soft material as the dress which causes the excess strap to hang down.  It is closer to the underside of the bust rather than the waist.
4.0,Looked great for photo shoot.
4.0,"Thin material, but nice."
4.0,"love this legging.  pocket is a little small for my phone, but it still works which is why i purchased them."
4.0,Cute little charm.  Enamel finish is nice.  However cannot really make out writing like in picture.
4.0,Beautiful watch holds time well only down side is the band is sharp on corners
4.0,Es fácil de ajustar y cómodo exactamente lo que esperaba .
4.0,Just got it so have not wore it yet but it looks good!!
4.0,Super cute but slightly see through!
4.0,"I bought this to wear to my niece's unicorn-themed 5th birthday and it was perfect for the job.  It's a little hot after a while, but I imagine all wigs are.  I would recommend for anyone who needs a unicorn wig."
4.0,The top part broke very quickly
4.0,"These boots are wonderful, my girlfriend absolutely loves them, except that they are extremely too large. My girlfriend wears a 7.5 normally and I read that these are too large so I ordered the size 7 and they are extremely too large. She has about 2.5&#34; of extra room in the toe. Other than that, they look amazing, nice punkish looking boots.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: When I placed these in my cart the price was about $26 and when I checked out the price was raised to $30. I thought nothing of it until I looked back at the page and the price was lower again. I email amazon and they checked it out, Apparently the price would fluctuate ~$2-$4 every ten minutes, so I was refunded, but to others, beware of the sudden price changes."
4.0,Nice underwear but not seamless. The bottom lining is raised making it show up in tight clothing. Besides that it’s pretty comfortable.
4.0,I absolutely love these glasses. The frames are so fashionable and cool. Can't wait to buy other colors.
4.0,"Easy, breezy summer dress! Cool, comfortable, and has POCKETS!"
4.0,"I like it. It tends to shift when you don't want it to. Comfort is ok after a few mins, the back sits near the tailbone. Not painful just different after a while it us kinda nice actually. It stays in place better than a pouch.<br /><br />Best description I can give is a jock strap without the butt squish."
4.0,"I love the safety; however, this billfold is quite stiff, and I always struggle to get my drivers license and credit cards out of the pockets."
4.0,Nice looking but you have to buy the Tracy Gold shoe to wear these.
4.0,Cute summer shirt as I daydream of warmer weather. Fit loose as I hoped and tts
4.0,only because it fits tightly.
4.0,Good material and fit as expected. Looked great with the matching wig and shoes.
4.0,"This wrap dress worked as I needed but I w God have liked it more if it see cotton, the fabric was a bit clingy."
4.0,boots were great
4.0,The bow falls out very easily. They stretch very well but it’s slightly flimsy.
4.0,"Soft, nice quality"
4.0,"I received this necklace in exactly 10 days. Very fast shipping for an item from China! This necklace arrived in a lovely blue and white mini box that has a navy blue ribbon on top. Great packaging!<br /><br />I received the necklace in alloy. It is a beautiful shiny silver color that looks very expensive. The faux crystal on the side of the heart are the perfect touch. The mini heart inside of the big necklace is able to come out and be worn alone. So, it is like having two necklaces for the price of one.<br /><br />I recognized no fading in the necklace, and I have absolute no allergic reaction to it. This necklace is the perfect present to give to someone on their birthday or the holidays.<br /><br />The necklace is very high quality and at a very low price. It is definitely worth a buy!<br /><br />I provided some photos of the item down below!"
4.0,"These are really comfortable. I bought two pairs. The first pair started to separate after 1 week, which was disappointing. I ended up using some shoe repair glue and they are working fine. Very comfortably but maybe the quality is lacking in this model.  I have been buying this brand for many years for the comfort level."
4.0,"I actually really like these.<br /><br />I have a pair of the original brand name that these were modeled after and love them, so I thought I would give this slightly cheaper knock off a try.<br /><br />I actually am torn on whether I like the name brand or these better!<br /><br />So here's the break down...<br />The shoes really only consist of two parts...the yoga mat sole and the cloth straps.<br /><br />I like the sole on the originals better. It seems higher quality, especially the bottom that touches the ground, and is softer than these.<br /><br />But then I like the cloth on these better. The cloth on the originals is made of cottony t-shirt like material, which I have found can get sort of warm in very hot weather. I still love them, but it's a problem for me. These are made of some sort of polyester blend, and they actually stay cooler in hot weather than the originals. The material is also silkier.<br /><br />The pair I ordered of these are a size too small, so I am returning them, but I've already reordered the larger size. Just take care that you might need to order a size larger than what you normally wear.<br /><br />It is possible that the seller of this product has provided the product at a discount or for free in return for a thorough and truthful review.

4.0,"It seemed a bit small for an extra large.  But it was enjoyed as a gift.  Hope it doesn’t shrink upon washing.  Other than that, good quality."
4.0,My son can easily rip these off his feet... I'm hoping when his feet grow and they are a little tighter it will be better!
4.0,"I ordered a 6 and received medium. Both my sister-in-law and I ordered a 4 as well and received large. Sizing is messed up but other than that these leggings are comfortable and light. Large is a bit looser but both are stretchy and fit fine, they also get a tad tighter after a wash and dry cycle."
4.0,"Color was good on the garnet stone, but clasp was too flimsy. Returned."
4.0,"I actually love these leggings, especially for this price. I wear them to spin quite a bit. They're fashionable without being flashy, and I stay cool because of the mesh. Would definitely purchase again. Just wish they came in a petite size because they're quite long on me, but it's not really noticeable with the mesh."
4.0,"It's very nice but as some other reviewers have said, it comes a little short versus other belts at the same size. It is nicer than whay youd find at a tj maxx but not as nice as say a brooks brothers belt. This would make a great gift too as the packaging is very attractive. Would be five stars except sizing issue. I received this item at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,Great bracelet. It does seem to run small bit overall good quality
4.0,bought this as a gift for my little brother and he likes it. It was a bit cheap looking in my opinion but he loves it so that's all that matters :)
4.0,"It's hard to be a fan of either fitover or clip-on sunglasses. That said, these sunglasses seem to work really well and aren't bad looking. I like the ability to be able to drop them down on my chest when not needed. If you are careful with the model you choose, they should fit your regular glasses fairly closely and don't look like you are really wearing two pairs of glasses. They're not like wearing prescription sunglasses, but they are cheaper and may fit your next regular pair of glasses if you don't make a major change in style or size."
4.0,"This dress fits and is fairly flattering. Good quality for the price. My only issue with the dress is that is bulges a little at the back. It’s quite flattering in the front, though."
4.0,"For as expected, good for price. They’re a little thin but not too sheer, especially for the price! Even in black I wouldn’t do squats or weight training but they’re good for cardio and solid enough to wear day to day."
4.0,Purchased for a gift.  Recipient said &#34;I love it!&#34;
4.0,The face mask is going to be use for sun protection. But for the near future it will be my cornea face mask. Just what I expected
4.0,"These work great. I have used them for yoga, weight training and snowboarding. They fit my large head well. FYI- Don't put in the dryer."
4.0,"I have very neutral feelings about this piece. It definitely looked cuter on the model versus real life. I know to limit my expectations/not have any for most non-branded items but this what I think. Well, for starters one of the photos says “high quality material” if I could describe the material to you it would be a thicker version of a white beater that’s less soft. I purchased this in white so it can be somewhat see-through if you’re not wearing the proper undergarments. I thought it was going to be more cropped but it covered my torso pretty well but I also have a short torso.<br /><br />If you’re looking for something quick, easy, cute, and don’t care if it gets damaged or dirty I’d say totally get it. You can totally use this as a gym top, take on vacation, use for activities, or just wear out casually.<br /><br />I didn’t give 5 starts only because of the high quality material misconception… it’s definitely not. I don’t think I’d be too comfortable sweating in this on a hot day."
4.0,I like this bracelet but wish it had the accompanying part of the verse insde. It does meet my need.
4.0,"As expected for the price. Nice, buttery soft, good quality fabric. Only giving 4 stars because the bottom of the leggings are not tight and the opening is wider than it should be."
4.0,Nice shirt. Casual button down.
4.0,The shirt is excellent quality. I just wish it fit more loosely for working out.
4.0,Nice darker green color - plain. Fits as expected
4.0,Way to big for an almost 6 yr old.
4.0,The length of the chain was perfect and I loved that it came with a small pouch for the necklace to be stored in.
4.0,"Very cute. Daughter LOVES them. They fit rather large, but she can grow into them. Perfect shoes for summer."
4.0,"Very, very cute! I wear it everyday and with no metal to tarnish I have a feeling it will last awhile."
4.0,As-described; white gloves. Worked well for our child’s Halloween costume.
4.0,Like the look and fit of most of the socks both black and purple pairs are to small the other 8 pait's fit perfect
4.0,"I originally had planned to have these custom made for my groomsmen, because I was worried that the shape of Texas would not be accurate but after receiving them they looked exactly like Texas. They were really surprised and pleased with them and so was I."
4.0,"I like this shirt, the material is just a little clingy"
4.0,"Daughter sz 6 loves these, fit well on small frame girls, lettering started peeling off slightly on one after only a few wears/washes. Might buy again, good product for price"
4.0,"I was so excited when this finally arrived.  It is exactly like it's advertised.  It's pretty sturdy IF, you're real careful to mind a couple of things.<br />#1.  Pay attention to the Cross. Make sure the clasp that the Cross is affixed with is secure or it'll fall off sometime during you wearing it.  (This happened to me.)<br />#2.  Watch how wet you get it.  I wore this almost every day, I loved it that much.  However, whenever I washed my hands, I got more and more comfortable with NOT moving it out of the way of the water.  This caused the material to become weak.  So whenever I took it off and put back on, it got looser and looser.  Almost like it was fraying in a very tiny way at sides where you open and close. (Yup, this too happened to me.)<br />#3.  When taking it off and putting back on, be sure to be careful of how far you open it up because if you open too far, it'll come undone and you'll NEVER get it back together. (Yup, you guessed it, this happened to me too and now I have scrap.  However, I think it's because of more than one factor.  Like because of water AND being in rush to take off.)<br /><br />Regardless, I still recommend this bracelet.  (I mean, it's barely over $5 with shipping!  AND if you pay heed to my warnings, yours should last longer than mine which was around 2 months.)  I'm ordering another one but Will probably order a couple this time."
4.0,Some of these snap easily but can be easily fixed as well
4.0,"Item came as scheduled, packaging is nice. However I guess there was a fold during the pattern printing because one of my blue flowers on the back has a big white line through it. Its not worth the hassle of sending it back so I will just keep it. The skirt is cute. I'm a 16-18 and ordered the XL and it works great, I don't wear it on my natural waist though so I guess that's why. I may try ordering another style from another company but overall it was worth the cost."
4.0,"For the price, you can't beat this item.  The glasses are a bit flimsy, but I don't think they are really intended to do much other than act as a costume piece.  The gas mask itself however was a bit heavier and I believe it might actually work a bit.  Don't ask me to try it out on chemicals though.  Maybe on a dusty road.  We purchased this for my hubby for Halloween for the Breaking Bad, Walter White costume and it seems to be a perfect fit.  When it arrived it was in a bubble wrapped letter size envelope, and upon opening it, it was packaged in a flimsy cardboard package with an even flimsier plastic cover that was off.  However the mask and goggles were in good shape, nothing was broken.  If you are looking for something inexpensive and to get you by for a few parties, this would be your mask."
4.0,Looks so chic and great price for a chic look!!!
4.0,"bought these pants for my two boys and thankful i bought a size too big. These run a little small and my 5 and 6 year old are very tall.  The inside is not as soft as i would like, but after washing the inside is a little softer. Both boys wore them though and did not complain.  My 5 year old is extremely picky about pants so the fact that he likes these is a huge win.  They are a nice thick material and take a little longer to dry, but overall I am happy i bought these"
4.0,"Quality seemed to be okay, but when they say &#34;big head&#34;, they ain't joking. I wear an XL at most hat shops, and this ballcap made me feel like a child wearing his Dad's hat. Would make an awesome hat for people with extremely large heads."
4.0,I was looking for a simple watch with accurate time and good battery life.  I  won't be able to speak to those attributes for months.  The watch comes well packaged with good clear instructions (you may need<br />a magnifying glass to read the tiny font).  The face/display screen is smaller than expected but clearly<br />presents all necessary information.  Its seems to be a bargain at this price.
4.0,"Wish the quality was a little better, but they are comfortable shoes that look presentable still a good deal for $30.00"
4.0,The fit pretty well I had to modify one because the print was off but no big deal still fits fine
4.0,"After reading other reviews I decided to go with a size 10 though I normally would of chosen 12. I am 5'3' 160lbs, so fairly curvy. The dress comes to just below my knees and is very fitted in the waste, hip and thigh area. Which it should be in this particular style. The chest area is a bit big so definitely for really busty ladies. I'm decently busty 38D and its a touch loose but not by much. Overall I'm happy I chose size 10 and feel it fits well enough. The fabric is a little thin but not too thin and has some give and stretch. The pleats in the bust and waste area weren't set well and did require me to iron them to fix them a bit. In addition this material is not wrinkle free and the dress will require ironing anyway before wear.  I really like the dress, it looks good. Both sexy and classy!"
4.0,Very nice runs about a quarter small but is still comfortable material
4.0,"Long these. I was looking for Minnie ears to fit my 3 month old and of course the parks don’t sell any. I found these online and they are so cute on her, they do fit a little snug once on so I just stretch out the elastic once on to loosen it<br /><br />Taking off one star- have tried to stretch the headband and no luck, baby can’t wear them for more than 10 minutes without getting a red line on her head"
4.0,You can never judge the size from the photos!
4.0,"Sizing as expected, good mid-weight pants, cuff is snug but not too tight on larger calves. So happy to have pockets and an adjustable waistband."
4.0,"I love the fit and style of this suit.  I would give five stars because the quality is great but there is no breast support.  The halter strap put too much pressure on my neck.  However, I was able to sew the strap to the back of the suit which gave more support and didn't tug at my neck.  I got many compliments on it.  People thought it came that way and I left the extra material to dangle like a flap....  Not sure I can explain that right."
4.0,It fits well and is very light weight. Perfect for summer!:)
4.0,"Really nice set....it has become my &#34;go to&#34; set for many of my outfits. (I wear a lot of black)<br />The only problem is that the hoop that the pendant is on has a tendency to rotate and the pendant can fall off, so I find myself checking it throughout the day when I wear it to make sure that I'm not about to lose the pendant. I've come close a few times."
4.0,Quality product and terrific price
4.0,"this dress is simple, comfortable."
4.0,Love the colors on this shirt especially the exotic peacock! It's fit was good. The only thing I have a slight problem with is that the fabric is pretty thin. I'm going to be wearing it under t-shirts this winter in the Northeast and was hoping it had some weight to it. Otherwise I love it!
4.0,Great product. It works. Delivery was super fast too.
4.0,good cheap outfits to wear for play or whatever. Kinda thin material but not see through
4.0,"Great necklace b/c it's not cumbersome yet makes an impact. It's not a typical gemstone necklace that's raw or polished, as it's a nice chunk that's displayed horizontally. Would like it shorter in length but it does have an extension that sits at about a 16"". It's past that valley between the collar bones which isn't what I wanted (about 2"") but this is nice really nice for the price point, style and gem presence."
4.0,Such a comfortable addition to my wardrobe. I love having a nice pair of flat boots to wear.
4.0,"The shirt is very nice, but it runs really small.  My son wears an 8-10, so I ordered him a 12 after reading the reviews.  I should have ordered a 14."
4.0,Never the less It's a nice top...
4.0,Nice but too small .
4.0,Very flattering and comfortable. Great price. If I could make one change it would be to make the bottoms with a control panel🙂.
4.0,Comfortable and work appropriate
4.0,"I like the compact size as if fits in the side pocket of my backpack.  The push button open and push to close are nice touches but once open it's small, my backpack gets wet.  I worry for my cell phone in the cell phone pocket.  I also love the color!"
4.0,Son loves this watch
4.0,It’s a bit small for a medium.. But loved it non the less
4.0,"I ordered this in the green color. It is almost an exact replica of the Name brand but costs a fraction of the amount.  The band is not as comfortable but for the price point is just fine.  The latching clasp stays closed, and I don't feel that it will come off during extreme sports. I would highly recommend this product"
4.0,"The quality is good. The color was a little more berry than burgundy but will do. It's a really nice little kit to give groomsmen, if you have a lot to give out. It's a great deal."
4.0,"Very nice! A little thin, but soft!  Fits good!"
4.0,Just the right amount of warmth.
4.0,"You couldn’t ask for a better lounge room. I know my robes cause I live in them like clothes. Soft, durable, has been washed 2x and still looks brand new. Color ,seams spot on. Plan on getting 2 more. My only complaint is it took a long time to arrive. Other than that, it’s well worth it."
4.0,This face cover fit my 4 and 6 year old girls better than the ones with ear loops
4.0,"I ordered this in the green and I like it a lot. I have worn it even with the temps outside in the 70's. It's great as a wrap instead of a jacket or cardigan sweater. I like my sweaters a little looser and this one fits the bill just perfect. The construction is actually flattering to a larger chested woman such as myself. I am in the process of ordereing it in gray and burgandy. Great with jeans, dress pants, long skirts, even over some dresses."
4.0,Bought these for a Valentines Day event- glad I did!
4.0,Everything but the mask worked great!<br />The mask didn’t fit at all.
4.0,It's a little hard to get in but I love it and get a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,"I LOVE THE LOOK OF THE DRESS, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY NOT A ""PLUS-SIZE"" DRESS AS STATED IN THE DESCRIPTION. I AM A SIZE 12/14 AND BECAUSE IT SAID PLUS SIZE, I ORDERED THE LARGE. BUT WITH THOSE OFF THE SHOULDER SLEEVES, IT'S WAY TO FITTED AND LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LOOSE LOOK, YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO ORDER AT LEAST A SIZE OR 2 UP."
4.0,My husband loves these shorts.  The waist fits perfectly for his 33-34 waist and the length is just above the knee on his 6' frame.  They do wrinkle pretty easily but still look good.  The super lightweight material is great for the hot summer weather.  The mesh pockets keep dirt from accumulating.  The only gripe I have is the left rear pocket is sewn shut and is not easily opened.  I used a seam removing tool but still snagged some of the material that will eventually fray.  I don't think it is necessary to sew up the pocket.  One star deduction for that.
4.0,"When the band ZZ Top recorded the song ""Cheap Sunglasses"" way back when, these Mysandy Vintage Square Sunglasses would have perhaps deterred the Texas trio had such glasses been available then. These inexpensive sunglasses look pretty sharp, are really lightweight, and do a better than expected job blocking out the UV rays.<br /><br />I have used them for a couple of months, and the glasses are still in one piece, unscratched, and pretty comfortable. Recommended for the money."
4.0,Super cute and would have given it 5 stars if it were a little larger.
4.0,"This dress is SUPER cute. I’m about 5’9”, 140lbs, and a C cup. I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. It’s pretty short, and VERY low cut, but I was comfortable with the size.<br /><br />There were a couple places where the sequins were missing, but it wasn’t super noticeable. The lining of the dress peaked out in a couple places, but That’s easy enough to fix. The zipper was pretty difficult to zip/unzip, there was a lot of random threads/strings along the zipper making it difficult to move.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, I would say this is a good purchase, and I would likely buy again."
4.0,"I like that it came with tools to re-size it, but the color of the silver isn't quite as advertised, it's more of a matte finish rather than a stainless steel look. It matches the metal on the Samsung galaxy s3 almost perfectly though."
4.0,"My son loves them, but they're a bit bigger than expected"
4.0,"Shirt fit perfect, skirt was a little short, but we just added legging underneath and it worked!"
4.0,I really love these jammy pants. They're so soft and warm. The only issue is the cost. You can get the same exact pants at Walmart for 1/3 of the price.
4.0,"I work on a computer all day and use these to prevent eye strain.  They really help!  The only downside is they seem to always need wiped 😬.  They smudge easily, otherwise I would give them 5 stars.  My eyes tend to strain rather easily, so I notice a big difference when wearing anti-blue light glasses.  They seem to be especially helpful on cloudy days and at night.  The reading glasses part is a bonus."
4.0,I have not gone traveling yet but they do feel comfortable.
4.0,Me gusta mucho porque abriga muy bien y es bastante fácil de poner y quitar. Lo que no me gusto mucho es que yo compre un 3t esperando que le quedara un poco grande ya que mi niña tiene 1 año y 8 meses pero no le queda bastante justo y no tienen 4t
4.0,"nice glasses, can break easily broke by child under 5 year that why I took one start, the rest is Ok"
4.0,Great feeling material - very soft - washes up great!
4.0,it made the costume at the halloween party I was at. I enjoyed it immensely and it stayed in place all night!
4.0,I usually wear Women sizes and figured XXXL would fit.  I was wrong  The color robe is true to the picture on the website.  I will be returning the robe since it didn't fit.  Not the fault of the robe but the fault of my lumpy body!
4.0,Boom boots but size chart wrong...order half size up for a snug fit; order whole size up if you have wide foot and need more space.
4.0,"Beautiful watch, 3 stars because the battery was not working, but I did get a refund and the seller contacted me and apologized said this rarely happens. They said keep the watch and take it to get a new battery installed. Which I did and is working fine."
4.0,"It's a sturdy wallet, pretty much exactly as described.<br />Smells like leather, so you bet it's gonna feel like it.<br />My only problem was that the ID window was a little small and I struggled to get my license into it."
4.0,"If you’re looking for a thick product this is not it! But it does work if you’re not going to be standing out in the cold! The hood is oversized and I love it! Length is not bad, I’m 5”5 and it goes down to my calf, but I got the longer of the choices. Would not pay much more for the product. But fun for parties"
4.0,Very soft and comfortable material. Wish they had a fly.
4.0,"I love this. The colors and print are exactly as shown. My only issue is that the sizing is a tad tighter than shown. If you wear large or xl normally, I'd get 2 sizes bigger. I normally wear a large so I got the xl and it's tighter than I'd like. If you want it to feel looser, order bigger. Aside from that it's perfect!"
4.0,So far the dress looks nice. My only concern is when over stretched you can see through it. Try wearing tank top and spandex shorts and you should be good.<br /><br />  I also bought the white dress. I love the white dress. Size Large. I'm 5&#34;5 and wore sandals. I weight 190 and it fit perfect. Received so many compliments
4.0,Cheaply made! ok for everyday wear.
4.0,Very cute swimsuit. The top fit nicely but the bottoms were a bit tight on the legs/butt
4.0,The jeans are good! A little loose at the ankle for skinny jeans but not enough to make me send back. One thing about them is that even after a few washes the blue is on my hands/nails when I wear them..
4.0,"My daughter said that it was nice.On time delivery,thanks."
4.0,"Good quality pants. Thicker than I thought they would be and also if you have a generous butt compared to the rest of you, you may find they show a bit when you bend over"
4.0,My seven year old daughter is really happy with them so she has her own for swim team. Great price for what you get.
4.0,"I'm only giving it 4 stars for now be cause I haven't seen my boyfriend with it on yet.  I love this tie bold color and stylish design, it's definitely for the GQ man on your life.  I can't wait to see him with this one on."
4.0,"Great color, fit as expected!"
4.0,"It was fine, except that it may have been missized.  I have worn the size I ordered for years and this just did not fit"
4.0,"This dress is a little different in design, but is quite cool, the zipper pull has a simple but stylish, kind of mid-century, design and allows the collar/neckline to be styled in a broad range of ways. My wife likes it and it looks very good on her!"
4.0,Solid watch. Looks great and super affording. Only giving this 4 stars because it doesn't appear to be butter-proof. I spilled a large tub on my wrist and it stopped working for a few days. It started working again now though.
4.0,"This RFID blocking leather wallet does feel great in the hand.  Besides the zippered pocket at the top - rather a nod to holding coins although this is so small, it won't hold many coins; there are card holders/currency holders as follows:  3 pockets on the back for slipping in cards/currency; 3 pockets on the front hidden by a fold down leather piece with 2 more, smaller, card holders with a strap that snaps this down.  There is also behind this the folder down leather piece, another pocket with a clear plastic window like one would use for a picture ID.  Despite the RFID protection and how wonderful this feels in the hand, I rate this at 4 stars because I wasn't able to get a small collection of gift cards in this along with library cards, membership cards, and gift cards I carry.  I guess space for that was given to the zippered coin pocket.  When I place this wallet in my front pocket, it peeks out of the top of the pocket so I think it would be better in my handbag than in a front pocket."
4.0,"Super cute shoes, but the size runs a little large in my opinion. I ordered an 8 and 9 to find the right size, but both were too big."
4.0,"I think the dress is so cute and is a dusty blue more than a baby blue which I was hoping for. If looking for knee length this is likely way too short for the size listed. I bought a 5T/6T hoping my daughter could wear it once she is 4, and while my daughter is fairly tall for her age, she could easily wear it now. Definitely size up.  I wish they carried these in youth sizes to coordinate my 3 older girls!"
4.0,"These belly rings are cute but the bright, vibrant purple I ordered is actually closer too lavender. I'm pretty disappointed about that. The quality seems good and shipping occurred in a normal amount of time. They would work fine but they're not what I thought I was ordering."
4.0,"These women's fuzzy winter gloves are cute and colorful, and provide warmth and comfort. Overall this glove set is pretty nice."
4.0,The dress was really a really soft and comfortable material.  The material felt thick and well made.
4.0,It came  one week before the receiving time . It is a very pretty jewelry . I receive compliments every time I put it on. I love it.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:db3e95a906c11727b2d6c0e242963617]] I like the fact that it is breathable and lightweight not thick and bulky. Super comfy definitely a great shirt for summer or vacations. The material is really soft
4.0,"Good face mask, but very small. I don’t believe this would be good choice for many men, but fit my wife well so I gave them to her. Wish they had larger sizes."
4.0,Beautiful gray color and it looks great! One negative is that of the poms on the scarf came off when I was adjusting it so please be careful and don't pull on it.
4.0,"Likes:<br />The fact that it actually looks like the product (👚) images. 😊 Some sellers are VERY deceitful and use images that look fantastic but the actual item you receive is very different from the product photos. 😡 It's a sad state of affairs, but hey.. That's capitalism for you. 🙄😒<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />None, actually. 🤔<br /><br />Notes:<br />The material is really thin. This can be considered either good or bad, depending on the needs of the individual who's going to be wearing it. This is why I didn't list 📃 this fact under 'Likes' or 'Dislikes'. We'll see how it (Logo) holds up after multiple washings. I intend to update this review to reflect my findings. I love my fellow shoppers and I try my best to help you to avoid any regrets. 💛"
4.0,I used these to store my little collection of pocket knives.
4.0,I wish it was a bit bigger.  If I go out of the house I feel like I  should wear leggings with it.  It seams to work its way up you.  I know that sounds weird but it climbs up you as you wear it.  I do like it and have had complements.
4.0,Worked great with the outfit I got them for.
4.0,its a lot bigger than I hoped for but its a nice purse.
4.0,"First impression is that it's a decent watch.  Especially for the price. I'm yet to see how long it will last, but &#34;time will tell&#34;.. (pun) 😁"
4.0,Sturdy and seems to be good quality.  If you have a small wrist I wouldn’t recommend this particular band.  Because of the side pieces my watch isn’t close enough to the skin and my watch kept asking for the password to unlock it thinking it was no longer on my wrist.  I haven’t had that happen with other watch bands.  I do have rather small wrists though so I don’t fault the company for this issue.
4.0,Pretty but its missing the dome.
4.0,"These were really cute and definitely served their purpose, only thing is if you plan on  partying like I did you may lose them because my sweating caused me to lose all of them over the course of Homecoming weekend"
4.0,"I have been looking at this ring set for a long time and decided to purchse it.  It is a very unique in style and metal choice.  The smallest size I saw it in was an 8, which makes it a little too big for me and my friend to wear, but it could be put around a necklace."
4.0,Just a nice look.
4.0,Really nice vest but run a little small but the wife wears it daily
4.0,Wonderful! I bought it hoping to everything that it wouldnt look like costume jewelry. Omg it looks so pretty! Vibrent silver with jewels that sparkle like i spent more then i did.<br /><br />I havent had it on for any extended time to see if there is any green cheap jewelry rub off yet. I will update with different stars depending on green rub off turn out.
4.0,Elastic around the foot tends to be somewhat tight. I had to return the original and go to the next size up in order to prevent the elastic from cutting into my foot
4.0,This was a perfect bracelet for my theme look.
4.0,I didn’t like the string but you can take it out.
4.0,"I bought this for a costume so I was more concerned about the color than the quality, but as it turns out, the quality is better than expected for the price. It doesn't look or feel cheap at all. For a belt in a fun color to wear with certain outfits, this is a good buy. I'd buy it again if I ever need another color. However, if you're looking for a belt to wear frequently and last several years, you're probably better off spending a little more on something sturdier made from real lather. I'm not sure how it would hold up to constant every day wear."
4.0,"I bought it small and it was big on me, i had to use a lot of safety pins and stuff to be able to use it. But it was really good quality, and nice so if you pick your size right, it's okay."
4.0,"I used this for a Jack Skellington outfit matched to a suit I rented.<br />The elastic band was more than stretchy enough to fit around my 20"" neck and did not cause any discomfort.<br />It doesn't get 5 stars because the very edges of the bat do kinda flop in. It was easily fixed by a safety pinning it to the collar of the shirt."
4.0,This is basically a rash guard material shirt for dogs. It very cute. Large fits about 30-45lv dog
4.0,"The price was great - they are so cute and pretty comfy. I don’t see them lasting a super long time, but time will tell."
4.0,"I love the dress, super cute.  Got it in a large as I am not a small person, but I am small chested.  It was tight in the chest."
4.0,Cute but cheaply made.. Mine ripped a little once wore a few times
4.0,"Daughter loves this, has not taken it off since opening it.........soft, well made"
4.0,Cute but very tight around my head and I don’t have a large head. Runs small.  Can’t wear it for very long use to the tightness.
4.0,"Not bad for a blouse, material is stretchy and light weight!"
4.0,Very nice. Like a necklace. Metal pieces.
4.0,fabric runs a lot has to be washed alone
4.0,"I ordered this in pink and it's a very nice baby pink color, however it is very thin and would only be suitable for summer weather unless you wear a sweater or jacket over it."
4.0,It’s a cute shirt. The material is a little thin but perfect for this spring weather.
4.0,Excellent costume with a perfect fit. I found that the hood is not really necessary however. It would be a nice touch if it could be separated from the rest of the suit. If you wear the costume for a long period of time and find you need to use the restroom you will need to unzip the entire costume as there is no separate zipper in the groin area.
4.0,My little girl is a superhero freak and she loves this hat. I would have given this item five stars if the wings flapped ever time she pushed the lever ball
4.0,I love these for walking in the rain when I don’t want to wear clunky rain boots. The only problem is the top is so tight that I can’t close them all the way. If you have extremely skinny ankles you will be fine!
4.0,Love them! I have sensitive ears and these don’t bother me one bit.  They only thing is they aren’t as shiny as in photo but I love them.
4.0,"Good Quality, smooth fabric, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I went by the 1st pic where the flowers look pinkish (they're not) the 3rd and 4th pictures are more accurate. None the less it looks nice so I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"Clearly, white shoes are not going to hold up during a muddy soccer season, but my daughter loved them, and they did make it through the season!"
4.0,Did not fit his wrist
4.0,"The shirt is nice quality cotton and the colors are very nice and it fits well but the sleeves are a little too short, don't cover my elbows all the way. (I ordered the XL and I'm 6'2)"
4.0,This was a gift and my friend loves them!
4.0,"Petite, 4'11 & 100~105lbs.<br /><br />It fit pretty nicely! I haven't bought leggings like this before so it did hurt my heart but I'm sure there are leggings out there that are more expensive. Super comfortable. Although I don't have the best butt, its decently flattering (I think it'll flatter people more who have a 'bubble butt'). My butt isn't flat but it isn't a bubble butt either, so they look OK on me 😂"
4.0,"Super cute shirt. I essentially love everything about it, but wish it were a little longer. I'm sure it would be perfect for someone of average height, I'm 6 ft 1 in. And it does cover everything, which is more than I can say about most tops!"
4.0,"These are really cute and well made. I love how soft and velvet-like the fabric feels. Unfortunately these fit more like leggings on me and the waist is a bit tight. I think a large would have been much better suited for me. For reference, I am 5’5” and 145-150 lbs with some junk in the trunk. I wanted these to fit a bit more baggy so I may return and get a large, or maybe even extra large. These seem to run kinda small."
4.0,"It's perfect! It is very soft, a little lighter material, perfect for fall weather. I would keep in mind that it does seem to be mens sizes, I am 160 5'3 and ordered a Large, its Perfect!! Love it!"
4.0,Band was broken on watch
4.0,Super comfortable with built-in slimming capabilities and lightweight
4.0,It’s a fine product and looks good
4.0,Don’t dry them because they will shrink hang them up and let them air dry after washing them.
4.0,"Out the package, the significant other was concerned because these socks were a bit large for her feet; she wears a size 6 shoe.  After washing, the socks fit reasonably well.  However, she encountered another issue:  the toe seam is relatively thick and, perhaps because she has small feet, she finds that she can feel the seam.  She feels the seam more when she wears shoes.<br /><br />These socks are soft and attractive.  The multi-colors are feminine.  The significant other was initially concerned that these socks seemed thin.  However, after wearing them for a while, she realized that they are definitely warmer than her typical white socks.  Indeed, her feet seemed to become a touch too warm at times.<br /><br />Everything about these socks, from the 53% merino wool and 24% cotton to the warmth, softness, and appearance, are all positive.  The significant other would easily rate these socks as five stars except for what she considers to be a thick and stiff toe seam.  She compared these socks to her other socks and to my heavy, two-layer wool socks, and all those other socks have a much smoother, in many cases nearly unnoticeable, seam.  We deduct a star because of the seam.<br /><br />Our rating of value for the five pairs of multicolored socks is average.  There are many wool socks that cost much more per pair than these socks.  We were tempted to rate the value below average because of the toe seam, but we decided that without the thick toe seam that these socks might be slightly above average for value.<br /><br />As for overall rating, everything about these socks is pretty good except for the toe seam.  So close to five stars, and these socks just missed the mark.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
4.0,"Good old cotton but quality is not too great. Still far better than the toxic, carcinogenic, non-breathable synthetic clothing that has over flooded the market replacing breathable natural fibers."
4.0,Puerto Rican Pride
4.0,"This top fit as I had expected it to. I am 5'6 and about 145lbs and I ordered a size Medium.<br />It's a nice top and is very pretty.<br />The only things that I did not like about it were the material as it is kind of rough and that the back is very long. I understand that it's a high-low top, but the &#34;low&#34; goes down really low.<br />Other than that, it's a nice shirt and if anyone is on the fence about buying it, I'd definitely suggest that you do!"
4.0,I love these! Very comfortable and cute.
4.0,"These things work great, I had seen people comment that they were longer and that's why I bought them. I'm 5'11&#34; and weigh 250, with a bit of a gut and some loose skin due to weight loss. These aren't really long enough to tuck in. To give you a reference, I bought Nike Compression shirts (for $28 a shirt, nope) and they were plenty long enough to tuck in. Both brands were in XL."
4.0,Should be longer.  I slightly smaller than expected.
4.0,The top is made weird and the waist band was twisted but still wearable.
4.0,"I was very impressed with the quality and look of this Jacket. however, it is incredibly rough and itchy on the inside.. I couldn’t end up wearing it. I had to return it. They need to add a liner to the interior!"
4.0,"The dress is well-made and designed nicely, but it was a bit large. I normally wear an XL in Grace Karin 1950s style dresses, but I could have done with a Large on this one. I ended up returning it, instead of getting a smaller size, due to time constraints."
4.0,"At present, this product is working well and as advertised. I like having a watch winder that has two modes of control (turns per day and winding direction)."
4.0,"Bought this dress for my girlfriend. Dress fits well, very pleased with product. Material is thick and the colour as shown. Definitely recommend this product."
4.0,i would order up a size
4.0,"These are really good quality and offer great coverage for back of hands.  They are a bit pricey.  The smallest size is S/M which slides down my arm until I'm sweaty enough to make it sticky.  But I kept them anyway.  For reference my bicep is a scrawny 9.5""."
4.0,This was great for traveling. It held all of our documents including passport and travel papers.<br />Good quality.
4.0,Very comfortable wish it could have been a  bit longer other than length it is a great feeling comfortable and beautiful piece of jewelry!
4.0,"I want to state that this little jacket, although very cute, really is a Junior size. I ordered large after reading the reviews (I wear a medium) and it was still too small. I wear an extra large in juniors so I will return it and get the larger size."
4.0,Beautiful dress. The material is thick and better than I expected.
4.0,"very nice, girlfriend loves it, she's a size 10 and the med is perfect."
4.0,"The picture looks more like a light tan/taupe, but is white on mine.  Fits great."
4.0,"Very, very nice, great value for the price, thanks Luz."
4.0,Very nice but very thin padding
4.0,Good value. Stay up well.
4.0,"Very pretty. Mine had very sharp edges though and the cz stone looks white (foggy) rather than sparkly. But nice to wear for fashion jewelry,"
4.0,"Amazon description says 100% cotton.<br />Tag on item says 35% cotton, 65% polyester."
4.0,Great for the price! It looked really good.. I love the high waisted bottoms.. they were a little too big on me but then got bigger as they got wet.. the top fit me well but I’m shocked it was a large. I’m small chested and it was almost a struggle to make that it covered me.
4.0,My grandma loves them. They are soft and warm for her on winter nights.
4.0,Bought this shirt for myself girlfriend.  It's super soft and looks great!
4.0,Too big for my big head. I’ll save it for someone that needs it. Arrived on time though and no damage. If the frame was smaller but keep the big lenses it would’ve been perfect.
4.0,Great shirt...super fast shipping.
4.0,"I loved this dress, unfortunately, although I took the recommended advice to order up 2 sizes the dress was still too small. Will return."
4.0,I ordered the black dress and it's a bit longer than what is shown. I'm 5'6 1/2 and this dress is a a couple of inches above my ankles. They should also mention it is COMPLETELY SHEER.... like the whole thing is see thru! I'm now shopping for some type of strapless long slip to wear with it.
4.0,"Nice selection, one was bent but easy to fix"
4.0,"I ordered my usual size, XL. they are too tight in the waist & around my belly. I wish they would have fit. They are really cute. I did send them back."
4.0,"I needed new sunglasses for my 3y because his head is large (99%) and the toddler one doesn't fit anymore. These sunglasses are cute, light and seem comfortable, however the lenses are way too large for a 3yo. I'd say they fit from 5y onwards... Anyways, I'll save for him to wear it later."
4.0,Super soft & comfortable. A great fit!
4.0,Cute tank
4.0,Thin and breathable. Got an extra small. Fits a size or so bigger so buy down in size
4.0,It's really so nice. My daughter look like angel with this dress. But it's little larger than regular size.
4.0,"This hat will definitely block the sun! Easy to put on and take off.<br /><br />My head is on the smaller side so it was a little bit big, but still cute!"
4.0,"This is a nice bra. Plenty of extra room, may run a little big. It's a good purchase."
4.0,"Wish I would have ordered my usual size. I sized up and it's more of a lazy, looser fit.  It's not too thick or thin. Nice and soft on the inside."
4.0,I'm 180# 5'10. 50 yr old so I prefer a bit more give but they work fine in XL --
4.0,"I am currently 8 months pregnant so my belly is huge and my hips look wide but its a great fit. It is NOT see through if you wear the right colors or garments underneath. I'm 5""5 but even with my pregnant belly the dress still goes down to my ankles which is what i was hoping for!"
4.0,My son likes them but they get dirty easily thus minus one star.
4.0,"Cute, but nothing special"
4.0,"These socks are very long, and I am pretty tall, about 5’9 or so. They go past my knees, almost thigh highs. The compression is great, left my legs feeling refreshed after a long workout, they are just a litt On the long side."
4.0,Loved the sweater but I'm too short so the sleeves were too long. I will reorder smaller sizes if needed because I love PattyBoutik clothes!!
4.0,bought this for my daughter who had just purchased a match purse and shoes that was of her Savahnna cats natural body print.  Thought I would complete her look.
4.0,"Pretty comfy. I bought this for the length, it doesn't live up to the standard there, but I still really like it."
4.0,"I bought two different makes of bibs to see which is better.  This is better.  The neck size on the white bibs I bought is too small IMO.  This one is fine.  The material is a bit lighter in blue than in white, but I can wear it around my neck without discomfort."
4.0,Very cute however opens odd. Card slots somewhat small.
4.0,ordered size 4 received size 6 so these are returned
4.0,"These are exactly as expected, comfy and laid back. The material is actually quite thick! I have big hips and thighs, so I was surprised they weren’t too tight, but I do wish they were a little bit more loose fitting. I also wish they were a longer. I’m only a little tall, so anyone 5’8” and above keep in mind that they’ll definitely snitch on your ashy ankles like they did for me. If that doesn’t deter you, give them a shot."
4.0,"Pretty dress, seems well made."
4.0,"They are good sunglasses for the price. I really thought it was a nice touch that they came with a little dust bag to store them in. The only issue I've had was that the lenses pop out of the frame pretty easily, but don't want to go back in very easily."
4.0,"This bag is so cute! Black matches with everything so it’s easy to pull a look together. I was worried that the gold accents would look a bit cheap and tacky but pleasantly surprised that it didn’t at all. In fact, it helped accentuate the bag’s appearance.<br />The reason for the loss of 1 star is due to the fact that it’s advertised as a leather bag but feels a bit like plastic if that makes sense. Similar to a smoothen vegan leather?<br />Overall, I’m not a fan of the bag’s texture but lookwise it’s a nice bag!"
4.0,"I purchased this for my son's eighth birthday.  He loves it!  The body fits perfectly; the hood, when zipped over his face, is tight.  Overall, he really likes it, even if he cannot zip it over his face comfortably.  Four-star rating from me!"
4.0,"I love it. It makes me look so cute and it has pockets of course. I plan to buy more. Of course the straps have a tendency to fall down, but I guessed as much."
4.0,"Given how inexpensive, or downright cheap, the watch was it works pretty well. The watch is quartz accurate and my only complaint is that the watch face cover doesn't fit as snugly as I would like but at this price who can complain."
4.0,They arrived on time and in great condition! They were a little big for my face but I was able to bend the metal frame slightly to make them fit! They're so cheap I don't mind!
4.0,It’s lovely but the chain is too short for me.
4.0,looks just like the picture. it did arrive with 2 stains on it but i always wash my clothes before i wear them and it came out fine in the wash.
4.0,Serves its purpose well.
4.0,I just received my sweater and it's perfect and very warm. I'm very happy with this choice.
4.0,"Have used for over a year and not once has it come off the guitar nut! Thick and good quality, but looks cheap if you really inspect it. The leather is plasticy looking, but feels durable and shows little sign of wear. The pick holders are also the plastic leather and work, but feel stubborn and are more for holding extra picks, then actually convenient for yanking one out during a live show (the pick holder is not as good as the picture makes it look, but is still serviceable). I bought it since it matches my guitar, and would buy another if I ever lost the one I have."
4.0,Pretty little necklace.  Chain in very fine so I wouldn't recommend this for a youngster.
4.0,"I gave this four stars because it is a little big, but not huge. It still looks good and my husband likes how it looks on me. It is made of good quality fabric and it soft. It's also comfortable. I will definitely still wear it even though it is a tiny bit bigger than I'd like it to be. The shirt looks exactly as pictured."
4.0,Loved it wore it for Thanksgiving holiday.
4.0,"Overall good purchase. Ordered both black and gray. The fabric of the gray was stiffer and fit tighter than the black. Other than the color difference, I was expecting the skirts to otherwise fit and feel identical. Not sure if I would buy these again but they do make a great work wardrobe staple piece."
4.0,Good but different from photos.
4.0,"These were received a day earlier than expected.  They are pretty dark, and that's what I was looking for.  The fit is perfect for me.  I do appreciate the follow up from SunGlassUp.  If I find myself in need of more sunglasses I will be reordering.  I will also be spreading the word.<br />Thanks,<br />Carl"
4.0,"I ordered these thinking to get them for my aged mother. She already had a couple of the plastic variety, so we thought to compare them. These are foldable and they come with a water resistant travel bag... which makes them easier to take with you away from home. For those that have mobility issues, this may be a big plus in more ways than one. You can leave one of these in the car permanently, and still have one for travel or home use.<br /><br />The end is much improved over the plastic ones. While both ends and the clamp in the middle are still hardened plastic, the tube is aluminium. The clamp end is longer than the traditional ones and it has a silicone spike pattern to hold objects better near the rounded part and a fully closable tip to pick up fine items better. So, unlike the older variety which are shaped for glasses, jars, and cans... this one can do all of those as well as napkins and most things that you drop on the ground (silverware).<br /><br />While it does seem sturdier and more functional, the handle grip is also more comfortable and it is open instead of enclosed. This makes it more comfortable on our hands during use. We tested this quite a number of times and it was more comfortable and more efficient than the ones that my mother already had.<br /><br />Like the older style, these are still good at reaching what you cannot reach whether it is above you, below you, or in a tight space. If you have need of one, get one of these or something very similar in design...<br />I am rating these four stars, until we get more use out of them. As always, your mileage and preferences may vary..."
4.0,I didn't really understand how a 3 yr old and 10 yr old could have the same size head but it fit my 9 yr old perfectly. We were looking at some very similar glasses for over $30 but decided to give these a try with the price being so low. He really likes these glasses and wouldn't mind buying a couple more since he wears them to baseball practice and I can see them getting lost or broken. Great item for a great price!
4.0,Warm. Doesn't slouch correctly when wearing
4.0,"I use this while lifting weights, weed eating, and any heavy work. It's adjustable and doesn't have any sharp edges. It does make me sweat. Maybe it's supposed to do that?"
4.0,But to much material for medium can’t our the size because it was not for me..
4.0,looking forward to wearing/using these scarves on upcoming summer vacay! nice and soft and not bulky.
4.0,"For a &#34;china made&#34; item this seems put together pretty well. The main body is tubularly strong and the blade serrated as described. I haven't tried cutting a steak with it mind you, but it'd probably do well for slicing out someone's spleen. You'd have to ask the person to wait while you unscrew the knife and then screw it back on, but in this day-and-age it wouldn't surprise me if someone were that stupid."
4.0,Cute kind of thin but like it with a tano under it
4.0,"I'm 5'3"" and bought the dress for my ""Handmaid's Tale"" costume.  looked great but it was sooo sooo sooo LONG!  I tried to hem it but it's a lot of material!  Just beware so you don't trip!  Otherwise, I love it and it worked out great."
4.0,really cute.
4.0,"Nice bag, true to color and got lots of complaints, but the stitching for the extra straps are a joke. Anything with a little weight in the bag will loosen and eventually undo the stitching."
4.0,It’s cute but a little bit saggy in the shoulder. The shoulder is to wide for my daughter.
4.0,Just wanted to note thar this is very small
4.0,"Cute top.  The shirt itself fit fine.  However, the sleeves fit very small."
4.0,"Received the waist corset as it was true to it's color, just loved it.  Unfortunately it was a bit to small , I am 5'2 and weigh 121 and this was a very tight even on the last setting.  I should have read the descriptions more closely as I should have gone with a medium.  Either way I will be ordering the next size up .  If not sure about your size contact seller first before ordering, items are not returnable but customer service was helpful."
4.0,Daddy loved from his daughter
4.0,"Got these for my daughter as a gift! She loves them! Smaller than I though, that's why only 4 stars. But beautiful kids jewelry."
4.0,"This suit was cute, but I ended up returning because I bought two and I liked the support of the other one better. It felt like this one could lead to some slips with a well placed wave! Other then that the fit was was good. I ordered a Large I’m 5’1 about 170."
4.0,I bought a royal blue 3 piece mother of the bride outfit.  Color is beautiful! The outfit looks just like the pic.  The jacket & top fit fine.  Waist is fine on the pants but the legs r huge so will have to have them altered.
4.0,"This is a really cute, well-made nightgown.  It was a big hit with my 12 year old daughter.  My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the sleeves at the shoulder joint, are really poofy.  It almost looks Victorian, which is a little weird.  The material is nice, warm, and soft though, so that more than makes up for the weird design choice."
4.0,Needed to be a little more higher
4.0,Fit my fiance great!!
4.0,"Got a large.  5'9"" tall, about 180 lbs, 40-32-43 are my measurements. Was expecting colour to be a bit darker. Soft material, could be a bit thicker because a lighter colour would be see-through. Cute dress though"
4.0,"Very cute suspenders.  The battery pack is a bit large and uncomfortable, but pretty much what you would expect for light up rechargeable suspenders."
4.0,"Really recommend getting a larger size than needed. The quality is alright, but shrank quite a bit after a wash or two. I would buy it again, but would definitely get it a size or two larger."
4.0,"This type of bracelet is in fashion for teens. It is a big thing. With the multiple colors and the metal decorations, you have a bracelet that they will love to keep and share with their friends. My son, who is deceased, was born on St. Patrick's day, so I will give his daughter (one of the girls) the shamrock. The boy will get the Love bracelet for his girlfriend. A third bracelet will go to the other girl the hearts and the boy will get the infinity bracelet."
4.0,"Loved this shirt! Great price for the product. However, when I tried to rub a stain out the black text smeared on the shirt. I always air dry so I would be careful laundering this."
4.0,I think this dress is cute. Hides alot without making you look like you're in a moo moo  there is one issue tho. One sleeve has the flowers from the bottom of the dress. The other side doesn't. It's weird and looks incomplete. In the pics neither sleeve has it. So I'm going to return it and get another and go down a size. I think it's runs big so order down
4.0,I wish this came in 2/4 or XS. I took it to a tailor and it was still falling off .. cleavage issues all night .. cute cut. High low mermaid. Good material. Good zipper.
4.0,"not thrilled with it. wish neckline was lower, too scoop neck for me."
4.0,Order a size up . It was a little tight
4.0,"Comfortable fabric, well made, but definitely designed for very tall slender women, as they are extremely long and a tad snug.  The pretty fairies on conifer needles drag on the floor, as I am 5 feet tall.  If I were to alter the length, only the tip would be visible. :("
4.0,The neck is not as wide as some. However it’s not a normal neck. It is a little wider than normal. I don’t like that but maybe you do.
4.0,"It’s too early to rate quality but they look and feel as described. I am 5’5” and 180. I ordered XL but they hurt my waist. My legs are slim so that fit is great. I think I need a size 2x or 1x. However, returning and replacing cost so I don’t know what to do. I might ask if they’d let me exchange for free."
4.0,"This is a beautiful pair of dress pants that you can wear to any wonderful event. The material and the cut of the pants are beautiful and well done. Unfortunately, they were too tight on me, so I had to return them."
4.0,"Grate for cigs, not so much for cigars. The battery life is good, and it works wonderfully in the wind."
4.0,"Cute dress, a little see through."
4.0,Found this item to rum small... weird stitching in the hip area it bulges out. Very cute though I normally wear a size 10 and I needed an xl in this
4.0,For the price you can't beat them. They wash well and don't seem to shrink much at all. Feel comfortable and long enough to cover.
4.0,Great boots I love them but they're too small can't get my left foot in them. I would like to return them
4.0,it's very cute and comfortable! I'm a little on the thicker side and went with a large but I'm going to order an xl next time for more room to button the front. all in all though I really love it!
4.0,Good price and value
4.0,Cute but it didnt last very long.<br />We couldnt roll down the windows while we had them
4.0,"Need to be fixed on arrival, very minor, just putting the ear bud back in proper place. Works great though."
4.0,Overall the crystal balls are super cute. I received a few that weren’t properly sealed so glitter fell out. I won’t be able to use some of them at all
4.0,"This was very cute and well made. The fabric was thicker than I expected and not too sheer. You could even get away with not layering this. It didn't fit me well, but that's not the fault of the dress."
4.0,Very soft and warm. Does not make my feet sweaty. Shared them with a couple friends and they agree.
4.0,It's nice and small but can hold a lot I love it and does not feel cheaply made.
4.0,Very nice.  Just as described.
4.0,Very beautiful in person but a little fragile. The tika broke on my first wear but nothing I couldn't fix with. Also the Tika might require a couple of hair pins to stay in your hair regardless. I wore this for Diwali and it looked gorgeous with my pink white and gold dress.
4.0,"I ordered two pair of these sunglasses for my boys to use while they play baseball. They look great. We had an issue with one pair, but the company quickly rectified the situation. Great customer service! Would definitely order from them again."
4.0,"Nice quality. At 5' tall, the bust and waist didn't fall in the correct spots. The material was stretchy...I wish they had an extra small. It may have worked better."
4.0,"This is nice and did the job on my run in the cold. I would have liked it to be a little thicker material and a little wider to cover more, but once I started running and warmed up I was okay with the thinner fleece material, but I could definitely feel the breeze through it."
4.0,This is a cloth headband.  It is well made and would be as good as any other.  The markup for the right to wear the logo is ridiculous but there aren't other options to turn to.  Sounds bitter.  Probably is.
4.0,I like it. The working clock inside is cute and it is not too heavy.
4.0,"It is lovely, but a much larger pendant than I expected it to be."
4.0,Lovely colour and style however gets easily crumpled. Needs to be ironed each time.
4.0,"This was helpful. My sons spare glasses are too big so his teacher recommended these (not these in particular but in general). Patterns are cute and well made. Glasses stayed on well for a very active child. With continuous useage, slight discoloration but overall great buy. Comes with a bunch and that’s easy on a wallet for sure"
4.0,Pretty but know that it is matte finish and not shiny!
4.0,"I bought it to put on my hat, but the back bit that holds the pin is rather large and hurts my head"
4.0,They fit very good only problem is the string is too short but they stay up with out tying anyway
4.0,Very light and pretty comfortable. Haven’t had them long and mostly walk around a factory all night. I would take another chance on another pair.
4.0,"They look great, however the design created a distortion when looking down.  Be careful on stairs"
4.0,This bracelet came packaged very nicely in a sheer pouch.  The bracelet itself looks great and fits wonderfully.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair honest review.
4.0,"This isn't nearly as long as it looks here in the pic, and if you're a little wider around the hips, it doesn't fit quite as loosely as pictured. That said, it still fits nicely (not too tight and not oversized..but I wouldn't say &#34;fitted&#34; either) - it's cute with jeans, and I'll definitely wear it. but I would advise ordering a size up if you want it to fit oversized."
4.0,It fit well - I wear it to work.
4.0,"This dress looks very delicate and fits nicely.  Very cute.  I was worried the fabric was too cheap, but the pattern and fit make up for it.<br />I am not sure if the yellow color is for me, but it fits so nicely that I'm wearing it anyway. I just bought another one in blue."
4.0,I only ordered a 1 piece. Not the 2 pack. It is exactly what the description says it is. My son was very happy with it.
4.0,"Like people said, for sure, order at least one size bigger than you normally wear.  I normally wear a 33 inch waist, size medium.  I ordered a large and they're wearable, but a little tighter than I like."
4.0,"So, I just received my dress today, and all I can say is wow. It’s stunning. The fabric is amazing, the fit is perfect, and the overall design is great. As someone with DD’s I was very skeptical about the top, but I enjoy it. It makes my chest look amazing. The straps on the dress for my perfectly, however if they were adjustable the dress would be five stars from me. Being as I’m planning on going braless, adjustable straps would be preferred, so I can keep my babies in check, however a little bit of tape can go a long way.<br />I bought the dress in the color burgundy, which in person, is a very dark almost black in some lighting that I absolutely love. I can’t wait to wear my dress to prom, and will most definitely upload a picture then. The dress cost less than my prom ticket and is and I would totally recommend this dress and buy it again."
4.0,For traveling
4.0,"Great shorts, but for the life of me, I can not figure out why the camo was double the price of the exact same solid black pair I purchased??"
4.0,"Light weight,  nice lenses"
4.0,Well made and fits as expected.  Very pretty.
4.0,"I love the pants, the color, the fit, but I'm only giving 4 stars because several threads have pulled out already after one wear.  I'm washing them today, and if more threads pull out, I'll have to return them."
4.0,"Nice tops, fit well, but are NOT compression."
4.0,"Good leather quality and neat appearence. I think<br />it takes a little to get used to the plastic buckle, but indeed, there's nothing like walking through airport x-rays without worrying anything! My size is 32 and as suggested ordered a 34 and had a good fit. I just think the buckle could be a little more flush to the belt when wearing. That's why 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,Good product. like it
4.0,I purchased this wallet to carry my essentials including my Samsung phone and fit in the diaper bag. When I took it out of the plastic wrapper it smelled. It took a couple of days for the smell to dissipate. Not really happy about that part. Inside the zipper area is another area to place card which I think is a poor use of space. I think another zippered area for coins would have been better. Otherwise it serves the purpose I bought it for.
4.0,"The material is kind of thin (not see-through thin though), but super soft and flowy.  It's a good weight for being something that you'd wear as a bottom layer with a jacket and scarf.  The top is quite long and comes down just past my hip joints, which is perfect for wearing with leggings.  I don't have to worry about my butt and thighs being too exposed.  I ordered an x-large and it's very loose.  I normally wear stuff in the XL/1X/18-20 size range.  If you want something a little more form fitting, I'd suggest ordering a size smaller."
4.0,Really nicely made. The zippers have a very tailored look. Lining is fleece and very warm. A little bit large for me but I'm giving to a friend.
4.0,"Unfortunately this product was not the right fit though i tried the largest cup (E), if you are over a double D i really wouldnt recommend,the coverage and support wont be there, overall its a good item for the price if you are smaller cupped but this style is so difficult to find for the larger bust. If you are looking for plunge front and backless i recommend maidenform plunge bra at kohls, just had to throw it out there it took me months and countless returns to find something that worked."
4.0,"Great for the old school watch people, just like the 70's"
4.0,"As a bralette, it has the minimal support I would expect for my 38C chest. But it's crazy soft and comfortable, and very cute. Totally worth the money."
4.0,This watch is very lightweight and is comfortable. It doesn't get in the way of your wrist movements. The light doesn't work very well though. Thought of returning it but I just need something to wear outside.
4.0,Dress is very cute for the price however it is very stretchy (big under the arms) you may want to order size down... I am sending the large back for a med and order other colors.
4.0,Love the material!I have a bit of a love handle issue I am self conscious about so I tried my shapeware undies (Also bought off of amazon) and all I can say is WOW I put it on and Immediatley started hearing the song Body playing in my head! 😂It is not only casual but also can be great for a night out with the right accessories or even a beach cover up!If you feel lumpy I would not wear this without shapeware as it will define those areas you may want to hide due to the material.
4.0,"They are as pictured, and easy and pretty to wear.  Nice choices.  The one I've worn the most, maybe 10 times, has begun to fray on one of the ends.  Still, the design is not really that robust, kind of the nature of the bracelet, I guess.  There are still other to try on!"
4.0,"I wish I had known how long it was going to be on me; I'm 5'4&#34; and the back goes down to my knees, if not past them. Material is flimsy so heavy items (like a cell phone) really drag down the pockets; the pockets are best for holding lightweight items. Overall a decent item."
4.0,Very cute. Got to me quickly.
4.0,"Nice gloves, runs a bit small, but they stretch out.<br />Seller nice to deal with."
4.0,The sleeves were a bit too large but everything else is good
4.0,This actually fits my iphone 8plus.
4.0,"This case is a good size, big enough to hold my Aviator style sunglasses with out being bulky! The cover material looks great, however is a little slippery. The only change I would recommend is a ridge or groove on the lower half to give your thumb a better grip when opening."
4.0,"I ordered these for our 2019 Red Hat convention in Nashville. I fully expected to have to return them. My feet run to the wide side of M, and I have wide calves. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they fit, and how comfortable they are! The calves are a little tight near the top, but they will stretch."
4.0,"I ordered the short version in a small and it was so cute. Wore it for my graduation and it looked very professional, sleek in the black, and flattering with the tie waist. Exactly what I was looking for. Would buy again."
4.0,"Looks great! Professional , good color. Straps seem strong. I’ve used it for a few weeks and I really like it. Big enough to have what you need but small enough that you don’t over pack for the day.<br /><br />Only downside is the actual laptop pocket is too tight at the seams making it too small for the laptop. But the rest is cushioned enough that it feels safe in the main pocket."
4.0,I absolutely loved how the blue look behind the silver. Its very beautiful. The only thing i was concerned about is that its smaller then I anticipated. Very hard to find a picture to make that small to put in it without it looking blurry. But it worked out for me. I absolutely love it!!!!
4.0,"What a cute little onsie! Its a good material, it washes well. No problems there. Its true to the size as well."
4.0,Earring are ADORABLE! And seem to be fairly good quality. But I got a Santa instead of the little pigs.
4.0,I love that these socks can be worn with any of my shoes and so comfortable to wear. I just wish they weren't so high on my leg.
4.0,"This dress is very cute and comfortable.  I only wish it were made of cotton jersey, had pockets and was 2&#34; longer."
4.0,"The dress is a great quality and so cute. I was afraid it may be too sheer, but it was just right for an outdoor wedding. I just wish it came in an XS. I ordered the small (5'4"" and 113lbs) and it was loose at the neck and underarms. I would be extremely flattering when properly fitting."
4.0,I gave up and will wait until they are older to but more.
4.0,I should have gotten a size bigger for my daUGHTER..she'll be too big for it in a COUPLE MONTHS..
4.0,"It does help, a little on the tight side for a medium ."
4.0,"Shirt was alittle bigger in size, but skirt fit perfectly"
4.0,It’s basically a big piece of material but it’s lightweight soft and stretchy. I would buy in different colors.
4.0,"They are very comfortable and true to size.  I walk and move around all day long at my job, and these shoes are just perfect, very comfortable."
4.0,"Fits fairly snug around the calf, but I have large, muscular calves. Might just be me."
4.0,These are a good basic soccer sock. They are a little on the thinner side and run slightly small. But the plus is the ribbing at the arch of the foot.
4.0,I wouldn’t work out in this but it did the job for a one shouldered top I have.
4.0,Very  Convenient very comfortable a lot of  Space
4.0,Item runs a little large on size so I ordered accordingly nad it fits as expected
4.0,Very boho. Loose fitting. Hung on me a little.
4.0,Cute umbrella. Have not had opportunity to use it in the rain yet. A bit heavier and thicker than I'd hoped.
4.0,"Somewhat large, but loved the jacket and will get two seasons wear from it."
4.0,Very nice but didn't fit well on the bridge of my nose and could not be adjusted. If you don't have a narrow nose bridge you can make it work but it's not the most comfortable
4.0,"Nice but could be a few inches longer so the back part of the tie slides behind the loop, thus keeping the two end of the tie from separating."
4.0,"First off, I love it. The pattern is super cool. I'm a relatively tall guy at 6'3"" and this shirt fits great around my chest (I ordered an XL). It should be noted that it reaches down past the pockets of my pants to my mid thigh.  I wasn't expecting to tuck it in, since it is a flat bottom shirt, but it's much too long to wear not tucked in. If you're good with that, the shirt is light and stitched well. It does look sweet."
4.0,As advertised. It took too long to arrive.
4.0,Really like this sweater. It fits well and isn’t scratchy. It is a little thin so you would need something over it when cold outside. But overall a good sweater! I got a M for a bit of an oversized look and it’s perfect.
4.0,"This is a nice product but its a lot bulkier than I expected.  I really like genuine leather vs the fake stuff that is usually sold, but I am nevertheless  not sure if this particular item is ""worth every penny""."
4.0,This band is comfortable and great value for the money compared to apple bands. These bands work and hold up just as great.
4.0,"Just received this today and it's great! Way better quality than I was expecting. It's really nice and came with a free little gift. Just a few things that I kinda didn't like. The felt bag and box it comes in is purple and it's a man's ring. I just don't think the box should be purple for a man and now I will have to find another box. Also, my husband wanted to use this as a pinky ring and needed a size 7 but the smallest it goes is a size 8 so I wish there would have been a size 7 option. And lastly, the packaging. You can't open it without cutting the plastic package and I accidentally cut the little cloth that came with it and I was disappointed by that. But the ring is really great and I love it."
4.0,These are very warm and nice quality. The fit is very narrow.
4.0,"I can wear a 34/36 b or 32c and this just barely fits me well. A little side boob but definitely not for girls with a blessed chests. Super cute, good quality"
4.0,Incredible comfortable and very versatile! Easily dressed up or down. The fabric is extremely soft!
4.0,"Thinner than I thought it would be. And. It’s very, very shiny!  Together suggests cheap."
4.0,I liked the purse but it was too big for me.  I wish it came in a smaller size.
4.0,"I bought this for my three year old.  It fits perfectly.  Not too tight and not too loose. It's made from a quality material, not like some of those other leotards with the cheap thin, itchy material."
4.0,"It' was beautiful, but the earrings are too heavy."
4.0,I'm a 14 on top and 12 on bottom. 5' 9.5&quot; tall. I got a 2xl. I like that the waist is actually at my waist and not right under my chest. I should have got the XL. It's big in the waist. And I have a  thicker waist. There is no belt. Its just elastic but its nice and wide and doesnt roll. I'll update after I wash it. The material is decent. Oh... my husband said I look like an Amish woman  so I guess wearing it on a date night is out. I guess I can wear it to work.
4.0,"Not quite the fabric I was expecting. NO stretch, was expecting more of a spandex type of stretch in the fabric but I am happy with the quality of fabric. Not so thin you can see through but thin enough to be breathable in the sun. Perfect for an over dress if you're going for the renaissance get up. Wearing this under the Irish Over Dress. Fits perfect.<br /><br />I am 5'4&#34; and 235lbs. I typically wear an XL or 2X in shirts and a 16/18 in pants. The 2x/3x was a little snug around the shoulders (the fit is off the shoulder, not made to be worn up on the shoulders so it should be a little snug here due to type of fabric), but over all the fit is great. May need to hem an inch or two if you don't have skirt hikes and are short like me.<br /><br />I purchased the hunter green and it is true coloring. Perfect hunter green.<br /><br />Would purchase this again in another color of needed. Good product!"
4.0,"I dont know about the running to small talk, i ordered an XL based off the size chart and based off of people reporting it runs small and it is VERY BIG. Need to reorder in a large, possibly a medium. Very cute suit and great quailty overall"
4.0,Toddler/Infant gloves are really hard to find for some reason.  This is absolutely the way to go.  They are a little big for my 18 month old daughter but we plan to use them for the next couple years hopefully.  They are really soft and she loves the colors.  Great product.
4.0,Somewhat small and see through fabric in the light.  Would be fine in a dark room.
4.0,"Pretty, top is a little fuller than I wanted, so it made my shoulders look enormous lol."
4.0,Good looking strap and I really like how it complements my Baume and Mercier. It's an inexpensive strap but doesn't negatively impact the look of the watch at all. It is slightly uncomfortable on one side of the strap where the metal brushes against my arm. It's also a little short on length so be sure you order the right size for your wrist. I got lucky.
4.0,very comfortable.  would give five stars but the one negative is the waist band will lap over if im bent over a lot.  probably would not happen to a skinny person
4.0,As shown.  Fit well.
4.0,Nice bracelet.  Good fit.  Just arrived.  Only concern is how sturdy it will be.
4.0,Phone is hard to use. Takes a lot to get through the plastic cover
4.0,"I love the design, handy pockets and the fact that when I do squats and HIIT work outs, you can't see through these leggings!  I definitely would purchase leggings again from Gaiam."
4.0,The style material
4.0,My son loves his Fortnite pjs! He says they are nice and comfy  perfect fit. I noticed you need to wash them a few times to soften the material though.
4.0,Follow everyone's advice and order one size up.
4.0,"Dress was long on me, but I expected that. I'm 5""3 so that is always the case. Dress is comfortable and decent quality. But it is thin. I wore a white shirt and white leggings underneath for warmth and modesty. Worked great for our Forrest & Jenny costume."
4.0,Super soft material! But it runs VERY large! My mother-in-law is having to take it in in the back at least 4 inches or I’m drowning in it! I’m 9 months pregnant - 5’2 size small.
4.0,"Cute but too big on top!  I wanted to really like this suit and I got a medium based on the reviews. The suit looked too big at first (medium and I'm 5'5 and 110 lbs and a 34 B). I liked the bottoms actually and they fit but the top was too loose. I took out the padding but I need to be bigger on top and or broader in the shoulders. Also? The tie around the neck was not very comfortable. But? I like the innovative design and think it's a really cute suit for the price and quality. If you think it's cute, it will probably fit someone with a slimmer bottom and more broad shoulders/bigger chest."
4.0,As part of an overall stay warm strategy this item works well.
4.0,Looks really nice and is really sparkly. Fits pretty well around my neck and doesn't cause any irritation.
4.0,"Very soft, but the print is blurry and much smaller than pictured. It fits as expected, but the cat and fish take up maybe 1/4 of the shirt front. Also, mine didn't say Hans."
4.0,"When I saw the picture of the eye glasses I ordered on line from Amazon, I thought they  were beautiful; the colors were bold and bright and the frame did not look like it was a see through frame; but when I got the glasses, they are translucent; you can see right through them and the colors are not bold; I was disappointed for that reason. Also, this is the first time I ever purchased a pair of eyeglasses and didn’t get an eyeglass case ( cloth). I have another pair of Corinne McCormack eye glasses that I purchased from Nordstrom’s a few years ago and I like them."
4.0,Love em. Wish the sliding strings were a little looser.
4.0,"Very cute! Exactly what I was looking for, only complaint, the pockets kind of make the hips look wider, but I bought it because it had pockets so I wouldn't want them removed. Great quality, washes well."
4.0,"These earrings are a little larger than I normally wear, and I wish they were just a tad smaller, but I do wear them all time since they will go anywhere...to the gym to dinner or where ever.  You can't go wrong."
4.0,Gift for older friend who Loves this watch ! She's worn it day and night for two weeks.  The band just fits a large wrist.
4.0,It fits as good as I I expected it too fit! And it’s really comfy to wear
4.0,"I am giving this 4 stars because it is cute and I can wear it AS A SHIRT WITH LEGGINGS&#62; This item is soft and comfortable but it is not a dress, I am 5'7"
4.0,"This band is gorgeous. It matches the series 3 rose gold perfectly. HOWEVER, be careful and check that it properly closes on the clasp. I looked down and it was unlatched. Thank goodness I caught it before it fell and broke my watch... I had to disassemble and replace the permanent link with one of the extra links that had a more tight clasp.. the one that was on my band literally opened and closed with no effort at all. After some tedious work reassembling it, it’s secure with the extra link. I get SO many compliments on it and I’m in love with it. I’m a hairstylist so it gets wet occasionally with no problems at all."
4.0,Eyeglass cases are o.k. for the money.  The glasses fit fine.  Can't attest to the durability since they just arrived today.
4.0,"If you are from a colder climate such as upper midwest, this is not a heavy weight parka.  More like a medium weight.  The lining is nice, the jacket is comfortable and warm.  If you are looking for something heavy like a chubby quilted parka this is not that.  It is however a nice lighter weight jacket, good for cold weather, but you may need something heavyier for very cold weather climate."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I ordered a size large because other reviews said it ran small. I don't even have to use the zipper...I just pull it over my head. For reference, I'm 170# (5'8&#34;, 36&#34; bust, 32&#34; waist, 42&#34; hip at widest point). I will order again from this company. It arrived quickly too; sooner than anticipated."
4.0,"right size, wrong color.  But since they are so hard to find, I'm assuming they did not have my size in black."
4.0,"This shacket is really cute in person. It is intended to fit a little baggy, so order your normal size. It's honestly quite warm and has a good weight to it. The fabric is a little bit itchy when I initially put it on, but does not bother me once I have been wearing it for a few minutes. I wish the buttons were a little bit classier and less metallic-looking, but overall I really like this piece and plan to wear it more this fall."
4.0,Simple and a good everyday ring
4.0,"The mask is comfortable as much as you'd expect. The filter feature is good, and I like the adjustment things on the ear straps. I wish the inside were black instead of white for women who wear makeup. All things considered, I'm happy with the mask."
4.0,There is one problem with this dress.<br />if you spill anything on the material it may leave a mark<br />the dress  may leave s mark. Removing the dtain can be difficult.
4.0,Love this bag. I just wish the zipper was a better quality.
4.0,Very satisfied with price and fit of shirts and the material very soft.
4.0,"Beautiful dress - very flattering.  However, it does run small.  I ordered an extra size up and it was still a  little snug."
4.0,"Attractive, frugal, & solar. All bonuses in my opinion. The bezel not rotating, & it's 100m water resistance make this a four star watch. I think Casio should have taken this module & made a good field watch out of it.  A solar 'Duro' 200m watch should be made to replace this model that would give Citizen some competition. I bought mine used & so far it looks & works perfectly."
4.0,"Great quality, but the fit is very small. Normally I'm fine with XL - have several from other brands (Pearl Izumi, Shimano, Louis Garneau) that fit me just fine. I've bought Castellis previously from another vendor in XL, but had to return them since they were too small and they were out of stock on larger sizes. So I bought these here in XXL - yet they are too small as well. Sorry, as much as I like the craftsmanship I guess Castelli just isn't for taller guys (6'2', 220)."
4.0,"I've been wearing these for a couple weeks and they have not caused any issues.  Very small, cute earrings.  The only negative I've found is that they sit quite ""high"" (far away from the earlobe."
4.0,Awesome! My favorite coat and so far hasnt disappointed. Came already broken in and very comfortable. Keeping me warm in Fairbanks!!
4.0,"I definitely thought they were going to be a little more true to size, but they came on the smaller size. Love the material though. Even though they seem a tad bit too tight, I will still wear them because they are super comfy."
4.0,"I have used this every day for about 6 weeks and its a great bag- very roomy without seeming obnoxiously oversized. I'm a mom to 4 so i always end up with random toys, snack, socks...you name it and this holds it all well as it does just my wallet, phone and misc items. I have worn it both crossbody and shoulder/arm looks cute both ways!"
4.0,Did the trick for Halloween . Ok for the money
4.0,"it is a very nice slip & it will work, but I had to cut off some strings that were left on it."
4.0,Have been searching for the end all be all of anti fog for my rifle scopes.  I will say this is probably the best I've used but one drawback is a fine streaking that never seams to go away.  It coats the lens which leaves it susceptible to smudging and not 100% clarity.  Only solution that never fails is to have a dry piece of cotton in the pocket while hunting those rainy days.
4.0,I ordered these bc I am a dude & worried the shorter ankle socks would be too small to fit over my foot. With a bit of stretching they fit really well & the top bands are higher han I thoight they would be. I do have slightly smaller/average shoe size in a men's 8. They're only slightly tight & very kawaii
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE this! I was SOOOO excited when I purchased & received that! It looks great! But after a few days of wearing, some part of the the gold color started discoloring and turning to black! That does not mean you cannot wear it anymore, it’s just not as yellow gold shiny as it was!"
4.0,It senms like good material it just run small but the rest it look good
4.0,"It's a great watch, very convenient for daily use. but I want a black one like the one I lost. The picture looks black but it actually a strange dark grey/green."
4.0,These are beautiful earrings!!  I have worn them almost every day!!
4.0,"The quality of these slippers is excellent. They are soft, warm, and well made. Unfortunately they are tiny. The size said 8-13. These are lucky if they are 7-9. My 4 year old couldn't wear them and was disappointed. I'll be lucky if my almost 2 year old can fit them."
4.0,VERY NICE LEATHER CAP.  MY HUSBAND LOVED IT.
4.0,Nice and soft and comfy to sleep in. Or run your errands. Just overall Nice and comfortable
4.0,"The watchband is great, but I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because, when I got it, there were no instructions included, so I used the instructions on the internet. It showed to feed the band between the watch case and the spring pins to start. Everything worked great until I got to the first grommets of the band. Then it wouldn't go any farther because of the thickness of the grommet.<br />So what I had to do was take the spring pins out, move the watch case past the grommets, and then try to put the spring pins back in place with the band in place. Wow, no easy job but I finally managed. You could use a extra pair of hands for that. The assembled band looks good on my watch and I made the right choice."
4.0,I'm impressed with the fast delivery! I love the top it fits perfectly!
4.0,It has an odd fit so i just always where it backwards.. also it looks really cheap but the print makes it cool
4.0,Love the product has helped my feet feel better. Only complaint it that they are kind of cheaply made hasn't been a month and starting to unravel.
4.0,"So i bought this shirt for the upcoming RunDisney Marathon weekend. My kids and I picked droids to dress up as while we ran our races. This same shirt is on discountstarwarscostumes.com for 24.99! And that was supposed to be their sale! Anyway it does run REALLY small. The issue is the fabric- it doesn't stretch one bit. I am a size 2 in women's and the size small in this was very hard to get on. I exchanged for a medium and it's not much better. I think the armstraps keep getting longer but the body doesn't get any bigger. Anyway it's super cute and does the job, especially at this price. But seriously, they need to change the fabric to anything that stretches. This thing gave me fat rolls I didn't even know I had- unless it was pockets of oxygen being squished into my skin."
4.0,"I wear this probably everyday around my neck as a just in case I forget my mask. I got this and I can still walk into the Gas Station or grocery store without people staring at me. Only issues I have with this mask is that it hold in odor a bit more than I prefer and needs to be washed at least 3 times a week. So far for the last 2 months I have had it, it stands up to all the washes and has not broken down or seemed to have lowered in the strength and quality it was in the first place. Last issue is that its not thick enough to really filter anything out. It really is just something to say you have something over your face to comply with the rules these days. I would like to have had it a tiny bit thicker though just for the peace of mind."
4.0,Very pretty. Happy to find this length. Bought to replace a real tennis bracelet I lost on a cruise. One star off because it is a little stiff not slinky. But all in all a good buy.
4.0,"Nice band, color is beautiful (I got the rose gold)  I have very tiny wrist so will need to get it taken to have links removed. Looks great with the blaze. nice to change it up to have something nicer to wear aside from the leather band so I can switched it out based on where I am going/doing.<br /><br />I received this product free for my unbiased review"
4.0,"I got this for my wife to wear as a layering shirt, or just to wear for the upcoming warmer spring weather.  For her, she says it fits a bit odd overall, not bad, but different.  She says that in the chest area, it seems a bit big.  And in the abdominal area, it is a bit small.  It looks great on her nonetheless, and she did admit that she may just have to get used to it.  And she did state that perhaps it was her particular body shape that just didn't suit this shirt.<br />She chose the deep red color and it is a very nice color, something she was hoping for."
4.0,"They are a little big but if i just tie them nice and snug they are fine.they Look nice, showed up in good shape."
4.0,"I bought the purple one.  It is very pretty, but up close it looks a little more blue and little less purple than the picture.  In fact, there isn't any actually purple in the dress.  All of the &#34;purple&#34; sections, when seen up close, are actually just a very small pattern of blue and pink that looks like purple from far away.  It's pretty cool, but after trying it on I decided it's not quite the look I'm going for, so I am returning it.  Other than that, the fit is great and the material is soft and smooth."
4.0,"I have large calves and could not find a boot to fit properly.  I read all the reviews and thought what the heck? Great price and great look.  However, on one of the boots the buckle in back of the calf broke on the 2nd day I wore them.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I still like wearing them even though one is missing."
4.0,"Nice shirt 🙂 fit as I wanted it to<br />Thumbs up ! 49er fan since 78"""
4.0,Everything is perfect about this dress but the color wasn't as pink as I would have hoped for (to match my pumps)
4.0,Soft material. Has pockets which is awesome! Cute dress my husband loved it!
4.0,"Feels really good, need something to run to the store and back, setting outside, I like it."
4.0,loved thinness - can wear w dress boots and walking shoes!  liberating not to have too much bulk.  however not as warm to wear walking in house or at the ski chalet
4.0,"These sunglasses fit well on my face and are very comfortable. They style is cute, not oversized in style which is what I wanted. They are lovely. Wish they were more darkly tinted to block out more of the sun."
4.0,This hat is adorable. I love it!
4.0,"The sleeves are perfectly too long and I love that I can have ""sleeve paws"" or ""sweater paws"".<br />I'm short like 5ft even with a small torso and I wish that this turtleneck were just a bit longer by an inch or even two. It'll work since I plan to tuck it into my skirts and layer it under my tee shirts but personally I feel it's too short to wear with leggings or jeans.<br />The fabric is a periwinkle, pink, navy blue, and yellowish orange beige striped combo... It's okay, not the colors I'd put together and was expecting it to be more pink and purple only.<br />It's a thin long sleeve I can get away with wearing all year round if I really wanted to."
4.0,"I almost love these. They do seem to be pretty comfortable, and they do have a nice stretch. But my cellulite shows through in certain light, and that really sucks. I don’t think I’d want to wear these in the gym light, but I’d run around town in them. I’m a leggy 5’6 and they go all the way down to the ankle on me, and that’s a huge plus. The material is soft, but also slides around a bit on my waist. There is not enough compression in the band, so even if I did get over my cellulite I couldn’t wear these for high impact training or for running. They seem good for lifting though. They do appear to be squat proof as well. I ordered my usual size in VS, small. Other than the waist I do think the fit is nice enough. For reference I’m 28 waist, 34 hips."
4.0,"Great glasses, but the lenses are a bit small for women's glasses. However, they are made very well, and were in perfect condition."
4.0,"For the price I LOVE this dress!! I am 5'4&#34; 165 pounds and I got the M. It is a tad snug around the waist but fits great everywhere else. I think the L would be too loose. the length is also perfect, I can wear flats and still not have the dress drag. Someone mentioned extra fabric in the chest that they didn't like. I however, do like it because it helps cover a bit more cleavage and keeps from giving taller people a show!<br />The zipper was tough to zip up and down, my husband was afraid the dress would rip. The material is thin but not see-through, for a hot August wedding it wont be to heavy. I would recommend it."
4.0,They seem to run a bit small. Otherwise they are very cute and what I expected.
4.0,Order your regular size. I used the chart and ordered a size up...mistake. Too big
4.0,Very adorable and comfortable!
4.0,"Ouch.  I just received mine, having paid $59.99 for it, only to see that it's now $49.99.  Ouch.<br /><br />So, it arrives in one piece, in a single flat box.  The box is not heavy.  There is a lot of light foam-cloth and white styrofoam padding inside the box.  It's great that the product is protected, but the rigid white styrofoam had broken, and my living room and garage are now full of tiny white bits of styrofoam, just from taking this thing out of the box.<br /><br />The good news is that there is no assembly; you just open it up and fold it together.  It's a piece of cake to do, and you don't even need the provided single-page ""assembly instruction.""<br /><br />The sheet tells you that this item is from Lamps Plus, Inc., but there is not contact information whatsoever.  That's not good.<br /><br />Once opened, the table is a little lower and a little smaller than I believed it would be.  That's on me, of course, and it will still fit my needs just fine.  Just make sure you've done your measurements and that this is the right one for you.<br /><br />There is no carrying handle, but the table easily folds up and is quite transportable.  There is no lock or keeper to keep the item together when folded."
4.0,"Pretty dress, but it didn't fit me, so I returned it.  (It wasn't the dress sizing, it's my body at this time of my life). I hope to be able to buy it at a later date, once I lose a few more pounds."
4.0,My 16 year old LOVES this dress.  It fits well and looks great on her!
4.0,We used them for a play. They were perfect
4.0,"Other than being a bit small its beautiful. I still wear mine all the time, going on four months, just wish it was a little bit bigger."
4.0,"There is a insulated compartment on the bottom big enough to fits some drinks and foods (it expands), with a zip pocket on top for things like your phone or wallet, and a larger compartment on top behind the zip pocket that I would ideally use for a beach towel or two, or a blanket to lay out if you're doing a picnic.<br /><br />Downside - I had to play with the top buckle a little to get it close properly."
4.0,This is a slightly different style than the originals which are hard to find. Somewhat more difficult to pry open and close back up. Nice looking and strong magnet.
4.0,it started getting lose after a while and have to readjust again and again But I like it still.
4.0,Excellent material. Had it altered to fit my daughter for my wedding because it ran large.
4.0,"Usually wear XL, so I got 2 XL and it was a bit tight. I probably could have gotten 3 XL and it would be the best fit. Thanks!"
4.0,"Better than any other pop in bioflex Monroe lots I have gotten.  They fit tightly together.  I've had one in for 2 weeks and haven't lost the gem yet.  One of the gems fell out of the mount so I really only got 9 but for them fitting together correctly, I'm not complaining."
4.0,"It is very pretty, but small.  It fit my 5 year old granddaughter, she loves it.  Its very dainty and pretty."
4.0,Little disappointed at length of chain
4.0,Cool onesie I’m a big guy it fits somewhat small and I thought it was black but it’s more dark grey still please with my purchase seller respondsed quickly to my questions
4.0,"I ordered a medium - I am a 31 waist, 5'7&#34;.<br /><br />Quality and fit is great.  The pockets arent very deep and stuff will slip out of them pretty easily.  If they fixed that, easy 5 stars."
4.0,The earrings are big and noticeable. The quality isn't that amazing but they are wearable and I'm pleased overall. Came in the mail nicely packaged too.
4.0,"Nice colors, easy to get on and off and I use them when exercising. Great price for five of them. No crazy about the material but that work as they should."
4.0,"nice variation on a thong sandal.  The studs add ""bling"", yet the style is as comfortable as a thong."
4.0,it will do the job not the best material but for the price its good
4.0,"Very pretty, but...to big for me. I dont know how to make smaller."
4.0,"the XL is a little bit large for me but I thing a large will fit me perfectly. It's not white more like an off white, the longer is ok for me. I am a 6.01 feet. It' s on my knee"
4.0,"The belt is well made and holds everything secure. but it is a very tight fit in the belt loops. This belt is now used as a small duty belt when carrying. However, the belt is not a good choice when concealment is required."
4.0,These bands are a huge upgrade from the basic plastic ones that come with the charge4. They are finicky to get on but once they lock they are secure and the velcro holds tight.
4.0,A little small for male feet but still a great gift!
4.0,Nice fit/color
4.0,"I bought this hoping for a comfortable dress I can wear with a blazer. It didn’t disappoint, this material is so soft. It is double lined which makes it a bit heavier than I anticipated and it’s blue where I thought it was black, but all in all I’m pretty pleased with the quality and feel."
4.0,"As a cat person, I have had a great deal of fun with this ring.  For a novelty piece of jewelry, the quality is fine. You will enjoy the comments when you wear it!"
4.0,"Nice sweater with lightweight feel and soft texture.  I wear a medium and purchased a medium; it was a bit too small to button comfortably.  Other than that, I would buy this sweater again, but in a larger size."
4.0,Slightly snug but fit and price was reasonable.
4.0,Love the shorts...nice gotta.
4.0,"The design is very modern, I really like it. The only problem--the size it too large for me. I would love to see it smaller, otherwise looks like a cosume jewerly. I received this earrings at discounted price to test and review. It is only  my opinion. Some people might like larger earrings"
4.0,"cute, fits as expected"
4.0,"I liked the material, I loved the color green, and the length was perfect. I returned it for two reasons: the band that goes around your rib cage made me look pregnant and was very unflattering in the chest area. The other reason being overall it wasn't comfortable due to that band and just fit really awkwardly. Mind you, I'm 5'7"" 140 lbs, 34A, average and squarish build. I believe it's meant for curvy girls and busty ladies who actually fill it out. My best friend is build that way and she would look amazing in it if she didn't hate green.  I could've ordered a smaller size but I don't like right fitting clothes. Just not meant for my body type is all!"
4.0,"Fits great, now. The thong on the left slipper was attached incorrectly, so I used a seam ripper to correct this problem & they fit great."
4.0,"Super cute glasses, felt very light-weight but sturdy.  Unfortunately I had to return as the style was too big for my narrow face."
4.0,"The dress is really cute and a good quality. My only complaint is that it is a little short in the front. Even with high boots I feel I need to wear maybe a skirt with it, and maybe wear it as an overshirt/jacket."
4.0,"I like this dress. It is not as blue as it appears to be. It's more of a teal or greenish blue color. But I had seen that in other reviews before I ordered. I would like navy better, but it's still a nice dark color. It fits well and comfortable. I'm short (5'2&#34;) about 160 lbs so I went by measurements on the item's size chart to make sure I didn't order a size that would fit too tight. It's comfy, pretty and well made."
4.0,runs large.  suggest taking one size down.  good for warm weather.  good quality
4.0,These are good work out leggings but I took away a star because they are see-thru when you bend over or are doing squats. I bought these in black so I don't know if the other colors are more opaque. Leggings stay in place when moving around and fabric breathes so you won't be really sweaty during intense work outs.
4.0,"These socks were of surprisingly good quality! They stay in place and don't make my feet sweat. They look like they would survive many washes, I will purchase them again."
4.0,I love the color but fits kind of clumsy
4.0,Got this for a wedding my BF and I were attending. It matched my dress perfectly. Its silky and easy to use and looks great.
4.0,"Looks pretty, but the material is very hard. Maybe could it get a little better after some use.<br /><br />I accidentally bought the 38 for my 42 mm watch, but it’s not bad. It might look better due to the fact the bands are smaller and not so bulcky."
4.0,"Does help with ease of breathing for my claustrophobia, but is small. I am a petite woman with a rather small head/face and it is too small to open my mouth much for talking without sliding or moving around. Works great for shopping or anytime my mask needs to be worn for longer periods without much talking. But it would probably not be as comfortable for a man or anyone with a larger face."
4.0,Wish they were larger; but wonderful feel.
4.0,Bought this for my mom. She is still using it to this day a year later. She absolutely loves it. Great quality
4.0,I love my arm sleeves will buy again fix perfect
4.0,I love how sexy this dress is but with the slick like material and I am 5'7 I am constantly pulling it down to be the desired length (touching my feet). It does fit well but is clingy because of the material.
4.0,Very long but pretty and cheap price
4.0,Nice bikinis for sure. Pouch was a little tight but not bad. I think for the price they are a good buy
4.0,Pretty Dress. Stylist. Fits Perfect.
4.0,"Others advised to get a size bigger than normal, which I did.  So I'm an XL normally, and I got a 2XL coat.  The coat fits ok in the body.  A little big, but not bad considering I upsized.  The cuffs are way too loose, and there's no way to tighten them.  I'll have to rip the seam and shorten the elastic.<br /><br />Then there's this HUGE tag inside the hood.  No apparent function, but there it sits.  When I put the coat on it usually sticks up out of my hood.  My wife will come tuck it in for me.  That huge tag needs go!<br /><br />The fabric is nice, and it's comfortable to wear.  Nice pocket inside the left flank.<br /><br />If it fit right, and didn't have that huge tag it would be a 5 star light jacket."
4.0,"Its very cute and the ears are SOOo long, but for how much this costs, the fabric couldve been nicer. but overall its pretty nice!"
4.0,"I really like the glasses, that only problem they a little bit big but for the price"
4.0,"I loved this, but I normally wear a small and ordered a large because of the reviews a  I could not close the front. So sad, and I dont even have a large chest."
4.0,"They all look the same as in the picture, but make sure to look at what size you are ordering. I didn't realize that I orderd the 6mm ones and I was hoping for a bigger size so I was a little shocked when I opened them up, but I think I am still going to keep them."
4.0,With this rate this watch is awesome..
4.0,I bought this for a trip to Las Vegas.  Though it is not the best quality of material it is perfect for the price point and will work well for any day to night out.
4.0,Love these boots but after one season they started cracking
4.0,Cute shirt with a feminine taper at the waist. My daughter likes it.
4.0,"I really like this dress, so much that I'm ordering another in a different color... Light and airy, perfect for Texas summers.  Its pretty sheer and I'm curious to see how it'll hold up after a wash.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 135lbs- ordered a 6 and fits fine."
4.0,Really amazing belt
4.0,"It is the exact size that was advertised and I very much appreciate that I was able to trust the marketing.  It fit my 11.6 inch Lenovo Ideapad perfectly.  It is also as pretty as the picture.  I would have liked it to have a little more padding or stiffer fabric, but it is sturdy enough when I place it inside another bag or briefcase."
4.0,I think this hat is so cute but doe not feel the best quality but it’s so cute
4.0,They reduce glare as advertised. Nicely made. They are too small to fit over even small prescription glasses so not usable by us.
4.0,This dress fits perfect. I am 140 pounds with a small waist with hips and butt and I ordered an extra small. I can't wait to wear it.
4.0,Made me look slimmer. I was not expecting that from such a busy pattern. Also looks better in person than it does in the photo.
4.0,"Cute, but the knotted rope it hangs from came undone on me."
4.0,"Cute and cozy, but within 30 minutes it had snagged on my wallet, and then on my bracelet so just be careful."
4.0,"I'm 5&#34;9' & 156 lbs. I ordered a medium. It was a little big, but not too big to not wear. The material on the top is a little cheaper than I was expecting, a shiny, stretchy material. The dress hits the floor though, which is nice- it's hard to find that when you're tall! Overall, if you're looking for a summer dress, it'll work."
4.0,This is perfect for running!! It stays in place. Gives enough warmth without over heating and can still hear your surroundings.
4.0,Are made well and are confey
4.0,My son loves these  he wants more
4.0,The shirt is super cute but it is a little bit low cut if you’re looking for an oversize long T-shirt this is not it but other than that it’s super cute and comfortable.
4.0,"I normally wear a small, but they didn’t have it so i got the medium and it’s fine. The neck part just is a little wide so I adjusted it so make it look cute, but that’s maybe cause I have a small head and frame. But aside from that I’ve worn this once and it didn’t pill or anything, it’s also very soft!! As in, good quality soft. It’s a nice sweater and it’s warm."
4.0,Nice cap for running
4.0,The black part faded two days after I received it. Fixed it.  This to is losing its color.
4.0,"Stretchy and comfortable, but the entire body, including gloved hands and socked feet is all one piece (mask separate). There is a hidden zipper for a boy to pee out of but the hands cannot be freed without taking the whole suit down to the waist. Ewww...<br />We cut the hands off the suit and hemmed it for our 4 yo."
4.0,Cute bag does the trick!
4.0,"A little big, I’m 5’3”, about 120 lbs and this dress touches the floor but is OK with wedges.  I’m also small chested and the dress is a tad loose in the chest for me but does not sag or droop. It’s a great value for the price!"
4.0,"I got these for an older (10 yrs) set of Peltor electronic earmuffs. What is NOT shown in the photo is that there is a small plastic ring frame w/ tiny plastic hooks that just snap onto the outer part of the microphone opening. Very easy to install, but this frame, and especially the tiny hooks, are very flimsy to say the least. Even slight jostling around in a range bag or bump on any solid object when you're not wearing the headset will likely break off one or more of the tiny hooks and then the foam cap gets lost or blows off in a good wind. $17 seems a bit pricey for what you get. A few drops of the right kind of glue on the inside of the foam cup that would fasten the foam onto the ring would likely solve the problem of broken off hooks. Will try this for the new pair."
4.0,"I'm very pleased with this outfit , looks and fits great on my Grandbaby,"
4.0,These are great luggage tags.  Easy to put on and very durable.
4.0,Thinner material than I expected but still cute.
4.0,"Good quality, sizing is off."
4.0,"Just a little bit larger than I expected, I normally wear a 34B.  Fit in the cup area but the straps were a little loose; didn't stop me from wearing it!"
4.0,"I loved this, i bought it to wear to school and im in love with it. I had one button missing though so thats why i'm giving a 4 star but i would so buy this again."
4.0,i love love love this swimsuit...the only problem is i'm more bottom heavy than top...so the xl bottom fits perfectly but the top is a tad big i'm a 38 C)...but because of the great quality and it being soooo cute i'm just going to have the top altered
4.0,"So this is a nice skirt very light and very very shear.. I ordered the coffee but it's more of a tan, it's not as dark as the picture. And the length on me is not as long as the picture. I'm 5f 7inch and it catches me a little above my ankle, in the picture it's all the way down to the ground.. but all in all out Satan out of bed skirt I'm actually going to order the rose red to see how that comes."
4.0,Look's like the picture
4.0,"I purchased this bag in a purple and a pink.  Both are true to size and color.  It is a beautiful purse for a busy person on the go.  It looks expensive and holds items well if you are only carrying your wallet, a little makeup and a cellphone.  Sometimes the zipper gives me trouble and I don't care for the strap (I thought it would be longer). It's definitely worth the price but probably wouldn't pay any more than that."
4.0,"Great pendant! Feels really cool the only thing I would change is the chain, it is more of a woman's chain."
4.0,"I like the soft feel of the leather, the big button in the front is unique. I wish though I would have noticed in the pictures that this purse has 2 sections, a split interior department. Because of this, I can not utilize it to its full potential. Because of the split department, I fight fitting a magazine in - one compartment must remain empty to fit a tablet. 4 stars because the feel of the leather is super soft, the button is great and the detachable shoulder strap gives options. Great color - love the red!<br />This purse is also too big for me - it is long like a satchel and measures almost 17 inches."
4.0,Cute and pretty color but it was a very thin material just not what I was looking for so I returned. Looks like the picture though.
4.0,The fit was great. The material is thicker on the skirt than the shirt. It does have pockets.shipping took the longest and tracking wasn't accurate but I enjoyed the dress
4.0,Really like these pajamas!
4.0,im a medium 5'6 140 lbs and ordered a large but it was still too small and tight in the armpit area. definitely order 2 sizes up even if youre hesitant about it
4.0,"These are definitely granny panties, they don't look sexy but boy are they comfortable! These are 95 % cotton and I think cotton is the best fabric for undergarments for comfort and dryness. These are well-made; nice neat stitching and a good thickness of fabric. They are true to size, but stretchy enough that I could have gone down a size or two if they didn't have my regular size. I'd recommend these for comfort."
4.0,"The size was for a toddler, I believe...I was buying this for my few month old little girl....but, it's quite large for her.  But, it is SOOOOOOOOOOO cute and can't wait for her to grow into it!!!!"
4.0,"Material is thin and not the highest quality, but the dress looks and sits on your body exactly as pictured. The material is thin and stretchy, and has a lot of “give” to it."
4.0,"I really wanted to make this suit work, but the cups on the top of the suit were just way too small."
4.0,Needed for work.  It is a nice size.
4.0,Great product but came a tad smaller than expected but still fit. I'm a little worried about the material but it has held up well so far!
4.0,A blessing.  Thaxs
4.0,"love these leggings, they’re flattering to the butt!  The one annoying thing is the crotch part rides up to the front so here and there I have to pull it back down but other then that they fit very well!"
4.0,"I like this bra, it's not perfect and it's definitely not for everyday use but when I need a halter bra for certain dress this'll do. I'm a 34D and while a medium size is a perfect fit for my back, it results in a lot of side-boob coming out, but I found that sewing the straps shorter helps keep more boob in. To solve this problem you could order a size larger but then tailor the big back strap to be tighter under the boob.<br />I ordered mine from focus-sourcing on ebay for $12.99 and it arrived within 3 weeks, but there's no return with that option, so if you're worried about sizing order from amazon as there are free returns."
4.0,Just received it today and so far so good. I love the tortoise bumper it’s really the main reason I got this band. It’s a little stiff at first so I’ll see how it wears over time.
4.0,These are gloves for walking. Not for driving. Not for texting. They are warm. I have average size hands and got the Medium. They fit snugly which is fine. Price is right.
4.0,nice tie to compliment dark suit
4.0,As advertised. Nice affordable small quantity in a well sealed container. Worked well which means it is a fresh product
4.0,They work ok up to a point!!
4.0,"I would have given this 5 stars except for the fact that I unfortunately fell between sizes (between an M and a L) and wished my size L fit just a little more snug. Otherwise it would have been perfect.  While it is looser than I would have liked, it in no way looks bad or affects wearability. Sleeve length is perfect and shirt length too. It is only the stomach area which I would have preferred to be slightly more snug.<br />From a style perspective, the contrast between the top and bottom portion of the shirt is very well done and overall this looks better styled than comparable products from brands like Under Armor, Nike or Adidas, et al. They knocked it out of the park on style in my opinion. I would love to see a few more color options, e.g. a dark red or true brown color."
4.0,So many pockets and enough space that I can take everything I need for my work day. I have been getting a lot of compliments on it. I only wish it had a magnetic snap for a closure.
4.0,Fit great good quality happy with this purchase
4.0,Like this. Bought for fun. Sizing is small though and it isnt a worn look like shown. Be sure to size up!
4.0,"Product as described. Quality good. It was, however, a bit large. I am a size 12 and it's too big on me."
4.0,"This is an &#34;ok&#34; scarf. It's great quality, but just a little to fluffy for my taste and seems to take up a lot of room even around my neck. If you like a scarf that has some volume to it, this is the one for you."
4.0,A birthday gift--he loved it!
4.0,"I loved it, the ends are a little too open but I used pins to close it. Other than that Halloween was a blast and I got alot of compliments."
4.0,"i purchased these for my pink pair of crocs because i thought the pearls would complement it well. i was very VERY careful when inserting the charms; i damn near broke a nail so i wouldn’t break any, but two of them still broke. the rest look super cute, but that makes me nervous about how durable they’ll be when i actually wear the crocs. i will provide an update after wearing them a few times."
4.0,"A little short, ankle high when in heels"
4.0,This shoe is comfortable for in house.  Size is accurate for fit.  I find the straps tend to curl up as the Velcro does not cover the full length.  My only complaint is the height of the heel  … it tends to push down after wearing for a while.  The straps are good for someone with a high instep.  Arch support is minimal. Shoe is easy to put on with open toe leg compression stockings as the shoe opens wide and does not push the stockings and curl them up.  A little warm in the summer in Texas 😁.  Over all a good but buy. 😊
4.0,Nice hoodie but the yellowstone print started coming off after one wash.
4.0,Everything was great except the sleeves were too long.
4.0,"they fit well, the optics are what I expected, very happy."
4.0,"Very cute, a little big, but that’s okay. We got it so she could be Cindy Lou Who. And she definitely loves it!"
4.0,"Good quality overall, I am just returning because I don’t like how it fits on me. I like the top back where it sort of synchs in & the straps are cute. The outfit overall seems a little too long though. Doesn’t do anyone bigger any favors lol."
4.0,"I wore these jeans all throughout the 90's &amp; loved the way they fit. With this new skinny jean nonsense fad going around I was having trouble finding pants that fit over my work boots without cutting them. I searched for these on Amazon and was surprised they still sold them.<br />I ordered a pair (30) according to the size chart since I wear 33x32 jeans normally. The length and fit around my boots fit great, but the waist &amp; crotch region...forget about it! I will be exchanging these for a (32) and see how they fit.<br /><br />When I bought these as a teen, they came in normal sizes 30x30, 32x32, 32x34...not this one number size like chick jeans. I'll update my review when I receive my exchange."
4.0,This dress is beautiful. It’s more beautiful in person than the picture. This dress runs very small. I would highly recommend that you order 3 sizes up. This dress runs very very small. The shipping is Amazing. I had to return this dress 2x. I would highly recommend getting this dress and color
4.0,"cool shades not too dark, just rite!!!"
4.0,Lightweight and attractive beanie that feels well made and appears to have good stitching.  I'm hoping it lasts a while.<br /><br />My main complaint is that I wish it would have a little more stretch as I have a larger head and like to get some measure of ear coverage from a beanie.
4.0,soft and large enough to use as a wrap. Well made and looks expensive.
4.0,"Rigid nose bridge made these goggles unwearable. Had to return them. Can't recommend.<br /><br />Update: after receiving my refund, seller contacted me and asked if they could send replacement goggles. One pair they sent were quite comfortable and had a soft nose bridge. Different from the ones advertised, but I have to say, their customer service is excellent!"
4.0,"Looks good. Print is a little goofy, but I wasn't after photorealism. The fit is surprisingly snug between the fingers and cuts into the ""webbing."" Both myself and my partner experience pain at those pressure points after a couple of hours."
4.0,Very soft and comfy. Casual wear
4.0,Nice dress a bit too snug
4.0,Why did I not buy this about 15 years ago???!  I can now wear jewelry that I didn't want to hassle with. Yay!
4.0,"I ordered a size larger than I measured and I am glad I did.  These are pretty, well made, modestly cut, and an excellent price.  I got the 3-pack with black, white, and cream.  It is trimmed with a neat, narrow lace on the bottom.  The armholes are modest as well.  The neck lace indeed is a bit scratchy as some reviewers mentioned.  To me it is not a problem at all."
4.0,"These wings are wonderful, especially for the price. The wand is even a nice added piece. I’m happy with the product."
4.0,"I bought these to replace a pair I bought six months ago. I love, love, love the bag but the handles do not last long. Great news is I can replace them!"
4.0,"We bought these for foster twin boys that we had, however they went home soon after coming to us, so we returned them. We did open the package and look at the outfit. The fabric seemed very nice, thick, and soft. I cannot speak to longevity, however I do know that the outfit was definitely too small for the boys (6yo, regularly wore size 6 and 7 clothing). I would order up."
4.0,This dress fit very well over my breast and stomach but since I'm a curvy woman this dress was too short for my butt. One wrong lean or bend and cheeks would have been exposed.
4.0,Beautiful. Great for small hands.
4.0,"Nice dress, good material and not see through."
4.0,The pockets are &#34;nice&#34; however they make the sides of the dress stick out too much.
4.0,"This is a watch. There are no unnecessary bells and whistles; it is just a watch. The watch will tell time and has an alarm. This is my first watch, so I can't compare it to other watches, but it is nice and simple (and durable), easy to use, and can go with a variety of different outfits. My only complaint is that the light is terrible. If you use the light, it is not very bright, and emits only from the left edge of the display, which gives it a strange look. In many cases the light actually makes the watch harder to read because of the way it shines onto the plastic above the display -- a minor annoyance, but one which can be overlooked since the light will work well enough in complete (or near complete) darkness (which, I guess, is what really matters). I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for a cheap and reliable timepiece."
4.0,"The bodice is totally weird. I usually wear an off the rack size 10. This one fits my waist (30&#34;) but the bust is enormous, has odd cone-shaped padding inside, and the boning protrudes unnaturally. I will have to do some alterations myself. Definitely worth the $45 I paid. I will fix the weirdness, and I will have a great dress. Beautiful otherwise.<br /><br />UPDATE: I must add that this company did kindly notify me and offer a partial refund. They apologized for my inconvenience. Had this dress been over $100, I would have accepted. I think the price for this dress is very reasonable, and did not want to accept the refund. This company showed care and respect for me as a customer, and that should definitely be recognized. I added another star to my review for this. Thank you Grace Karin."
4.0,"This is beautiful. As mentioned by a few others, the disc doesn't hang in the center so I used a drop of super glue at the top to help center it better. Anxious to wear it. The color in the disc is gorgeous."
4.0,She loved the panties but said it was too small yet wears a medium. Great price though
4.0,A simple stain wouldn't come out.
4.0,"A bit bulky and band sticks to wrist. But, overall, nice watch. Value for cost."
4.0,"Looks great and is great quality! I'm very happy with my purchase. It does, however, have a chemical odor that doesn't go away very easily.. Also, the zipper is set a bit low, so when your bag is pretty full it doesn't close."
4.0,My daughter like a lot
4.0,The gloves were exactly as described.  They are Thinsulates so good for driving and warm.<br />My needs were for shoveling snow in the cold so I am not sure these are the gloves for me.  But not the sellers fault. My misunderstanding.
4.0,Used it a few times during our rain spell in Maryland.  Haven't had a problem.  Auto close feature is nice when going into buildings or getting in your car in the rain.  Just make sure you have tilted sideways a little so you don't get a a splash of rain left on the umbrella.  It seems to hold up in windy conditions.
4.0,Note detail and measure your waist before ordering
4.0,"I'm so picky when it comes to jackets because a lot of them look to 'poofy' for my liking. This one was relatively straight-cut and doesn't sag or bulge on the sides or bottom. The removable hoodie is a nice touch, however the length of it is shorter than the jacket and looks weird if left opened (see pic). My chief complaint is the faux leather smells horrible - even with two washes, Febreze, and those little scent sprinkles for the laundry, it still smells of hot fish. I did wash on cold and let it air dry, but I think I'm going to take it to get dry cleaned because it's genuinely a nice piece with that one exception. Also, I thought I wouldn't like the stretchy wrists, but it actually helps retain heat quite efficiently."
4.0,Very pretty dress and you don't have to iron it!
4.0,"Modest and cute!  My daughter loves the swimsuit.  She's not a fan of the coordinating headband, but I thought it was a nice addition.  You can't beat the price!"
4.0,My husband and I rocked these for my 80's Hip Hop themed birthday party! They were a huge hit!!! Exactly what we were looking for!
4.0,Bought in smaller size to wear as pinky ring. Brilliant color. Nice
4.0,I really loved my swimsuit know your size and everything is good
4.0,"Print and material both are just fine, better quality than I expected, good compression shirt, what's a bit off is the size chart, I got an XL just to to give it a try and it fit very good. I'm 5'4&#34;, 178 Lb, 40&#34; chest, 36&#34; waist, according to their chart I should've I got an L but it would've been too small."
4.0,"The wands only extend to 10 1/2 "". My ski boot is 10 1/2"" in depth, which is average in height.The end of the wands just barely entered the foot area.  If your boot is higher, the end of the wands will not be in the foot area, impeding the air flow. It heats up to 20 degrees C which is 68 F. I don't think it is doable to dry gloves, because the ends turn sideways, not straight up as is needed for gloves."
4.0,"Purchased for grandkids 2,3,4. They Love it!<br />Played indoors, but will transition to out door nicely"
4.0,"Beautiful skirt, love the fabric but just too long. I am 5’3 and it’s ideally designed for a 6 footer. Will have to get it altered/adjusted."
4.0,Bought for my nephew.  ❤️❤️❤️
4.0,"Good thick leather watchband, a bit pricey"
4.0,My husband loved these and was excited to get them as a gift for fathers day. The pins on the back are a little different than we expected but they still seem great!
4.0,liked the shirt but is very very long - almost too long. also ran big so would have ordered a size down.
4.0,very happy with purchase. arrived before it was scheduled to.
4.0,Great quality slippers and feel super soft! Only complaint is the sizing is off. I ordered the size 9/10 for my daughter who still wears a size 8 with room to grow and these fit like a small 8. I'll be keeping them because they're not worth the hassle of a return and were inexpensive and just ordered another pair up another size.:)
4.0,Cuffs
4.0,"My four-year old dino-loving boy loves this coat. As a parent in the Pacific Northwest, I love it too. It's waterproof with zippered pockets and velcro sleeves. The generous hood protest from the rain very nicely as well.<br /><br />There is just one small problem. The tabs at the base of the hood are both ""hook"" velcro - they can't be joined. And in fact, the they don't really reach each other. So the hood fits loosely over the head, but is easily blown off by even a light breeze. I engineered a fix that is pretty clumsy, but of course you shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />It's too bad, because in every other way this is superior to other boys goats. Truly waterproof. Lighly insulated. Bright and colorful. Great fit. But be aware of the hood tab issue."
4.0,"Im 5 7"" and weight 135lb, so I ordered Large since I didn't want it to be super short and have hips, but it it's like XL. Super big!  I think S might have been a best fit."
4.0,Nice size but fabric seems a bit synthetic to me
4.0,"This is a really cute gift set for a baby or a baby's Mom.  It is supposed to bring good luck and protection, and as such is probably more appropriate to gift to those Moms who put any stock into that.  The bracelets are pretty small, and I am not sure if an adult could wear them.  I personally also would not put them on a baby's hand, but only because I am over protective and worry about things getting too tight.  Please let my opinion not be an indicator or an implication as to the safety of this product.  That said, I could see myself gifting it to the Mom who has expressed an interest in items such as this.  It is well made, colorful and comes in a cute gift box.  I was able to get a great price on it so I could review it, and have enjoyed doing so."
4.0,"Very cute, but about 1-2 inches shorter in the body than I expected. I am a size 6, but 5'8&#34;, and I ordered a medium. I would probably go to a large if I had it to do again in order to get the length."
4.0,"My daughter loves this necklace. The way it glows is so cool. It was packaged a little too well, but it got here safely and quickly. I highly recommend getting one of these and using this comapany to do it."
4.0,"I read the reviews and took a chance anyway. It is super homemade looking, but I still like it. If you like the style and the team, you'll probably still like it as well. The snaps on the side don't stay snapped, but I still like it. It has character."
4.0,I would give it 5 stars if it was a little bit longer. It’s super bright.  I wear it at work. I’m a waitress. All the phans  love it too.
4.0,"Like the weight of the fabric and the print. Didn’t realize that with the way it’s sewn when I move around you can see through the front of the shirt with the wrap design, so that wasn’t ideal for me. Still a cute shirt."
4.0,"Looks the part, all but one of the knobs are fake but only you know that. Got some compliments on it. Battery went dead pretty quick, dollar tree sells them 2 for $1 so I replaced it and off I went. I bang up and beat up my watch's and even lose them now and then so $5 and a battery is better than losing a $50 or $100 watch or banging it up right?"
4.0,Bought this in XL for my 11yo who is 5'8 and 110.
4.0,Very cute! Could us a pocket.
4.0,"Fit is a bit on the small side but daughter is lot and lean. She likes fitted so she kept it. Adorable print, she loves kitties. Cute for preteen girl. Standard school casual shirt. Good price."
4.0,Very cute fits great
4.0,"The material is just okay, but it is very cute on. Great for the beach as a coverup or after workout."
4.0,This jacket is super cute with all the embroidery.  It isn't lined (which you can tell by the pictures) but it's perfect to wear over a dress or outfit on a cool day and it has lots of colors in it to go with lots of outfits.  I got a 4/5 for my daughter but this is definitely a 4.  It was too small for her to put on by herself and she can still wear a size 4 in a t-shirt.  Definitely size up if you are purchasing.
4.0,"OK.  My opinion.....  I like the offset of the black and the rose gold.  However, the rose color is not true to other items so its off if you use a rose gold case.  It is more of a gold/copper.  I think a copper case would match better but I bought a gold TPU case that seems to match about 80% (you judge).  At a glance I don't think you can really tell between the gold case and the band.  I personally think in a casual setting with walking around it goes pretty much unnoticed.  The links have a slight discoloration in the bends but again - not too noticeable unless you (or your other) might be OCD.  My pics aren't the best but hopefully it gives you a comparison of the gold TPU case against the rose coloring.  If someone fined aa copper shiny TPU case let me know !!!"
4.0,"Not true to size and isn’t exactly “sweatshirt” material. Order one size larger to fit normal, and 2 sizes larger for it to be comfy."
4.0,"This may be a women's cap, I needed a large cap to fit my medium head.  Although I prefer the Outdoor Research Men's Echolite Cap (not available), this has a fairly short bill and fairly light material.  A good choice."
4.0,"This bag is right under the limit for most airlines size-wise before they'll charge you for oversize.  This bag holds A LOT.  Since there are no interior pockets you can really stuff a lot in there.  I have used this 3 times traveling from east coast to west coast packed to the gills and at 40-50 lbs.  No straps have broken and everything stays put.  Because it is so big when full it is hard to maneuver.  There isn't a shoulder strap or wheels, but for the price and the ability to pack so much in there, just get a cart at the airport or put it on top of another bag with wheels."
4.0,Bought to match Swiss alpenflage (60/70) and does match it pretty closely
4.0,"Lovely, but my goodness they really are TINY!. I know the measurement is listed, but, honestly, who knows what 3mm means until you see it. Looking at the picture I thought they were a little bigger. BUT - as they were for a 6 year old they fit fine. Had they been for me I would've had to return them. Children's size = perfect.  I was having a hard time finding something with gold on the post for my child, as she has very sensitive ears, and these are perfect for her to wear and sleep in."
4.0,Like the colour
4.0,I like the color of the bands. The only issue I have is the gap between the fitbit and the band.
4.0,"considering how expensive this was, i expected more.  i cant even say for CERTAIN that it cleaned the hat at all (hat is black). but i do FEEL like it made some light difference.  would not buy again."
4.0,Cute and didn't irritate ears
4.0,I’d recommend going a size or two down
4.0,Really cute but is larger than stated size.
4.0,"I bought these form fitting shirts to wear in a hot climate. Only 2 out of 3 of the shirts feel cool to the touch. 1 feels like cotton, which is not quick drying. They also are not very form fitting on me, XS is loose on the upper arms, shoulder, and waist for me."
4.0,Material is subpar but looks nice and the fit was a little bigger for 2X
4.0,"Perfect setup for the way that I use it. A little cheap material wise and the interior coin zipper is a little finicky, otherwise I am very pleased with this wallet."
4.0,"They work very well. They're so strong that they even ripped the pin part off of one of mine so I can't use it anymore :( If you get these, be sure not to tighten too much!"
4.0,sorta cute.  not a good fit.
4.0,"Beautiful sneaker, fits true to size. Vegan but probably not fair trade, meaning company does not practice fair working principles. Moderate arch support, more support needed if you have a high arch in the feet."
4.0,"Really my first review and going to be simple.  Grid-IT I got it because a request by a customer that did not have Credit Card on hand. You will get a ziper bag on one side, I have Windows 7 Compact embedded DVD's 5 of them, is rugged and the media will not bend or scratch. On the other side the ""mesh"" various sizes, the suff you put on it will grab it because of a sequence of silicon dots on the bandage, yeap will hold your items. I have an arduino board, USB retractile cable, HDMI cable, a Pandaboard with power adapter, Serial cable, pen, SD cards, etc. I shake it and it holds.  Wow got to go, Thankx for your time."
4.0,Lindos pero la talla D parece una B
4.0,"These seem like good quality shorts.  They are my first pair so I cant really compare.  But there is a huge difference if I ride with them or without.  I wish the pocket was a little deeper, and they seemed to shift while I was riding around the 25 mile mark.  Possible user error.  Overall I'm very pleased with them"
4.0,"The shoe stretchers worked very well in stretching several low boots and shoes, accommodating my bunions comfortably."
4.0,I didn't expect it to bleed all over my clothes in the washer. Perfect other than that.
4.0,Color is ok. I don’t like that it does not hug very closely to neck
4.0,Cute and stays on!
4.0,I love it except I’m 5’10” and it’s too short for work<br />I got the  xxl
4.0,Cute but a bit small not stretchy
4.0,Good product I just wish there was a size small to order.
4.0,I’m a slim petite US 5/6 and the pants fit perfectly even though it’s labeled as XXL. The quality is good and very warm soft thick fabric. Only issue is sizing. Runs very small.
4.0,"Pricey, bit they don't rip easily as other do."
4.0,"Looks the same as pictured, but a bit loose in the grey section."
4.0,My granddaughter wears hers very often and it still looks great and for the price you cannot beat it anywhere
4.0,"Very comfy but color is a little strange.  Also jacket is very warm, really too warm for the Spring.  More like a Fall and even possibly Winter jacket."
4.0,What we need for our costume :)
4.0,"Great craftsmanship,well balanced feels gray when held above my expectations would definitely buy again"
4.0,Good for the value.. pretty
4.0,Fit is good<br />Has straps that can be added<br />Not as comfortable  as I would like.
4.0,"Good look, good quality"
4.0,Wrong color and the ups man who delivered it ran over and knocked down my front gate. He was trying to drive away until my neighbor saw him smh other than that this shirt fit perfectly I’m more sad about the color than my gate lmao
4.0,Looks awesome and great quality just a little on the small side. Overall happy with product.
4.0,This shirt definitely has more of a shape in the picture than it does on.
4.0,Cute sister gift. Vintage looking and words appeared and printed as advertized. It does not have alot of room for extention though.
4.0,"This hoodie is more lightweight than I had anticipated.  I expected it to be like your typical sweatshirt.  It's a thinner material, but still cute.  Of course, it says it right in the title that it is lightweight, but I guess I didn't pay attention. I can see myself layering this under a leather or jean jacket to wear with leggings.<br /><br />I ordered a large as I like my shirts to be a little bit longer and it only comes to about mid-butt. I had expected this to be longer, but again I still do like the sweatshirt, It's just different than what I had anticipated it to be.  It's fitted in the arms and a bit looser in the body.<br /><br />I really like the strings on the sweatshirt.  They are thicker, with no plastic ends so it gives it a bit of a different feel.<br /><br />The sweatshirt also came with a free ponytail holder and this thing might actually be more exciting than the sweatshirt!  It is really comfortable on my wrist, which is usually where my ponytail holders end up going.<br /><br />Please note, I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased review. This has no bearing on my thoughts on the product or my likelihood to recommend to others."
4.0,I love these pants! They are so soft and warm and comfortable. The bad thing is the cost. You can get them at Walmart for 1/3 of the price.
4.0,"Very cool Black Dice watch.  It you want to check the time in style, this is a nice timepiece to own.  Just note; the coloring is off in the photo.  The metal case is actually gold tone, rather than the subdued lighter tone seen in the photo.  Be prepared for a large timepiece and a large band, but that's really what makes it cool.  I never heard of Black Dice before, but their watches seem to be pretty unique in style.  And for the price on Amazon, it's a good deal."
4.0,"I like this shirt a lot. The colors are so vibrant, and the fabric is thicker and warmer than a T-shirt.<br />The &#34;thumb holes&#34; are super small, and the sleeves are baggier than I expected."
4.0,Cute dress and fits very well. It is more blue in person than in the picture.
4.0,"The only thing that prevents me from giving this 5 stars is...as others have mentioned...when you put a few cards in it and then try to put the removable &#34;inner wallet&#34; inside and zip it, it's REALLY tight.  I'm hoping that over time the leather will stretch, and make it a better fit...and I hope that happens before the zipper breaks.  I'll give it a chance...."
4.0,The bracket for the face mask does what it is supposed to do. It keeps the mask from getting sucked in and out while breathing and talking. Wish there was a way to attach it to the mask (temporarily) so as to not have to keep repositioning it.
4.0,I love how cute these socks are. They do run small (and I'm a size 5!) so my toes are cute but unhappy. Good for use for a few hours at a time. They hold up well. I've had them for over a year and no holes!
4.0,nice clarity
4.0,good looking hat I like it a lot keeps the sun off.
4.0,"It is just ok.<br />Material is a little thin and lacks body. Shape is flattering though and the tunic is pretty long falling mid thigh. The sizing is pretty true to size. The most disappointing thing is that the white is not true white - not even close. It is rather dingy, like it has been washed numerous times in a dark load. As long as I dont put it near anything white it will be fine for casual everyday running around type outfits."
4.0,It’s a very comfy t-shirt I use with the shoulder covered!
4.0,Very neat and convenient for storing sunglasses.
4.0,"Little on the smaller side.  I usually get there ones that are a bit bigger than this, but buying online is tough."
4.0,"This works great as a necklace but as a bracelet, it’s too wide to go around my wrist 1x and it’s just shy of going around my wrist 2x. Not a huge loss but sad that I can only wear it one way."
4.0,Great for the $$$$
4.0,Beautiful pattern. Very nice fit. Will purchase more
4.0,I really like the fit and material of this dress. It’s stretchy but very flattering to my figure. The sleeves are cute without being too “fluffy” product arrived quickly and material is good decent quality for the price.
4.0,Slightly tighter than I expected. But cute and looks as the picture shows.
4.0,"These socks are too thin for my liking. I prefer thicker socks. So I really can't ding them for making quality dress socks that are thin. My wife loves them, though."
4.0,"I really love the color and the length of this vest, the material is great as well. I purchased this vest in green and tan, great spring wear vest, excited I purchased these vests."
4.0,"This is an really good hat for total coverage. Also for less total coverage!<br />You can snap on or off 2 separate sections: 1 for your face that has a mesh breathing area & 1 for your ears & neck.<br />There’s also snaps on the brim to change the style by snapping the sides up.<br />It’s a really pretty robin’s egg blue with light gray trim.<br />So, looks & function-wise, it’s great! Size?? Too small for me!<br />Full disclosure: I have a big head. As in 7-5/8 fitted hat size. However big the adjustable cord around this hat is supposed to get is not big enough for me!"
4.0,The costume is well made. Happy with it. The only thing is the belt is super long. I had it shortened because of it.
4.0,I wish the sun was brighter but the colors are still nice.
4.0,"They were a lot thinner than I expected, but still nice and soft. :)"
4.0,"These do keep your arms nice and warm without adding the bulk of a shirt. Nice material and has held up through several washings, even one accidental run through the dryer.<br />I'm removing a star because the seller needs to add a size chart. I figured I would need the larger size as with other type sleeves but they're really large so they do fall a lot. I will however keep them and order the small to see how those fit. Several of the guys I work with tried them too, so figure the sizes are unisex."
4.0,[[ASIN:B00VILE3C6 Ferenzi Unisex | Classic Silver Face Watch with Modern Silver Stainless Steel Mesh Band | FZ15102]][[ASIN:B00VILE3C6 Ferenzi Unisex | Classic Silver Face Watch with Modern Silver Stainless Steel Mesh Band | FZ15102]]. This is a very pretty watch. I have received Many compliments since I started wearing it. I love the steel mesh band. It is very easy to adjust the sizing on it. It is very comfortable to wear. The only negative thing I can say about it - the battery was almost dead when I got the watch. It lost up to one hour every 8 hours.I replaced the battery and now it works perfectly.
4.0,"I ordered this item because of it's price and look.  I ordered based on the sizing chart and it fits well through the bicep/arm and around the waist/mid-section but it's a little large through the shoulders.  I have fairly large/broad shoulders for a female but it seems as if even my shoulders are not enough to fill this out so that it lays flatly.  I'll continue to wear it, but if I order another I'll consider one size smaller to see if it fits better through the shoulders."
4.0,They fit great. A tad when I mean tad big. Still almost true to size. They are made well.
4.0,The watch fits okay
4.0,The hoodie is very soft! It fits well and is warm. The only issue I could find with it was that the lettering feels very cheap. Like it will not last very long. But if you want a hoodie just be soft and warm in then look no further!
4.0,"The picture makes it seem like the top has a fitted bottom hem, but it's actually loose like a tshirt. Nevertheless, the way it falls on the hips does help create a more fitted look."
4.0,Wish they had a pocket.
4.0,"Pink was darker than picture, but it's fine.  Very comfortable dress."
4.0,I can't say that by far worth $40+...but i wouldn't return it.  It's a nice leather wallet.
4.0,"They're very cute. Not quite what I expected, I thought it was all one piece not 3 on top of eachother. But they're cute so thats all that matters."
4.0,"This is really a cute top and think the pic does not give it justice,,,but the top is not long as in tunic but is short in length thus the 4 stars. the blouse will hit you just a little bit over the waist but the ruffles will give it about inch or so.The sleeves are long over the wrist and I have long arms my height is 5'6&#34;. I sized up and glad I did but the top doesn't fit snug but it fits just right, no need for layering because the material is thick  in the bodice. This is a awful cute top beside being short. Going to pair it with skinny jeans or trousers and jacket."
4.0,Would buy another.
4.0,I bought the green and it’s perfect. The color and fabric are nice. I get so many compliments on this dress. It’s stylish and professional.
4.0,our boss loved it!
4.0,Muy lindos su color igual a lavar. Su. Tela muy suave lo recominedo muy contento con el producto
4.0,A<br />Little tight from the sleeves .!
4.0,The earing's are tiny size and nice. I decided to return it because prefer a bigger size Dove Bird earing's. I just have to keep looking.
4.0,Good smoother. Does the job.
4.0,Very happy with product! All HP merchandise is expensive but not all products are this great in their quality!
4.0,"This is a fine workout/casual top.  It is a little boxy.  I like that it's made of recycled material.  I'm 5'4, 125lbs, 32D and got a small.  Nice weight to it for spring or cool summer nights.  Washed on cold and dried on medium."
4.0,I loved the look of these in the pictures but they really didn't look good on my face.  They are not shaped to really shield your eyes from the sun.  They sit straight across your nose and eyes with no curve.  The balls kinda dug into my head behind my ears.
4.0,"Ordered in white for an all white pool party,  long, flowing maxi dress just as expected.  Fits in all the right places.  4 stars b/c it is so see through whatever you wear under it will show! I still like it but will use the white as a swim suit cover up."
4.0,"Color was pretty true to what was pictured and a good, lightweight cardigan for the price."
4.0,"Nice finish, because the gold is very yellow. Almost looks 18K. The only problem is it pulls the fine arm hairs often as wearing it. I am not so sure I like the braised edges. I think I would like it better without it. But it's nice for being gold."
4.0,"I love these but after wearing them 3-4 times they stretched. I wear and 8 1/2, bought the 7 1/2 - 8 1/2, stretched at least one size up and too large now."
4.0,"Love the keychain, but one of the links are pretty weak. I had to reinforce it. Works just fine now."
4.0,"Works great! Things to note when ordering, material is not stretchy and runs small.  I"
4.0,"So, these fit into my old M frames with zero issues, and they are polarized as advertised.  I intend to leave this old pair in my car for driving, so I don't intend to put them through hard use. For the price, it's hard to be dissapointment."
4.0,"Awesome corset for the price! The steel boning is flexible, so its not as sturdy as full steel heavy plate boning."
4.0,"There great except for the color,coffee but read like black! Light weight and very comfortable."
4.0,Doesn't fit as well as the first one I bought from this company but I'll keep it.
4.0,I love how cute these are. I just wish they were a tad bit longer lol my ears big
4.0,For me it was hard to judge the size of the bag although it's very nice.
4.0,Looks great in it.
4.0,"It looks awesome on the watch. I had to adjust the tabs under the pins and take out a link or two, but that was not a problem. Would recommend this as an inexpensive bracelet that looks high end."
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, not enough space for a week trip. Quality is great. Amazing bag for two-three night trip."
4.0,I have VERY thin legs and am very tall! Getting ones that stay up are a struggle but these do! Thank you!
4.0,Like to change my jewelry regularly and these chains make it easy and fun!
4.0,Love these and I have very small hands. The fit is great.
4.0,"I am a 36DDD and typically a size large. I ordered up To XL like someone suggested. The size was fine but not flattering on my body type. I wish it was more flattering on big chested women. Also wish that it was a little longer. Had to return. In general though, super cute and great quality! If you don’t have my problems then this is a great dress!"
4.0,"I have been using my Luokui Alpine Loop band for the past few weeks and so far it has been a solid addition to my Apple watch band collection. A few comments:<br />* Looks just like the Ultra (expensive) adventure watch band from that other company<br />* Stays secure while hiking, walking, and even running (though I am a slow runner so it wasn’t much of a test)<br />* NOTE: I accidentally unclasped the band once while taking off my jacket and I’m not sure if this was because of the clasp design or if I just didn’t have it on securely<br />*  Fit perfectly (I have smaller wrists and got the small size)<br />*  The nylon polyester wasn’t as comfortable to me as my silicon bands<br />Overall, a good watch band for a really great price."
4.0,"I am somewhere between a size small and medium for shirts and the top fits me. the skirt fits but is not snug, i am around a size 5 (US) in pants and i think anyone smaller would not fit, larger would be fine. Material is slightly see-through, but that is expected from something white"
4.0,"The lace isn't tapered around the neck, so it doesn't lay flush against the neck around the upper half. However it's still cute, and I got a lot of compliments. Definitely would buy again."
4.0,Very cute but just a little big for me.
4.0,Nice lightweight sweatshirt.
4.0,"Love the dress ,decided not to return it!"
4.0,Chin strap fits better with it going over the ears.  I did have it slip over my left ear but only occasionally.
4.0,"The dress I received was not the dress pictured, but it is still a great fantasy dress for a little girl.  The bodice and peplum are a sparkly pink on pink pattern with faux lacing.  The elastic sleeves have little tulle wings.  The underskirt is a solid pink taffeta with an overskirt in rainbow colored tulle that will swirl when the little princess twirls.  The waist, like the straps, is elastic which should allow for some growth.  The dress is hand washable and laid flat to dry.  It would make a great princess or fairy Halloween costume or just for fantasy play."
4.0,The band bunches up and is discolored. Watch face cute though.
4.0,"I bought this for my Amazfit Bip. Beware, some color peeled off after the first few weeks, but ultimately I'm pleased with the style."
4.0,A bit tight but very cute
4.0,"When the fabric stretches, the print begins to whiten so you can't see the print quite as well."
4.0,"Great size for travel or overnights.  Wont hold toiletries and cosmetics, unless you use minimal cosmetics."
4.0,"Dress is great for the price. I’m 5’9, 140lbs, and the medium fit perfect! Not too short and not too big up top (I’m pear shaped). Not uncomfortable to wear at all and not see through. The material I feel like won’t hold up for long (tips easy) but you get what you pay for."
4.0,Product functions normally
4.0,"I love the fit, pockets and the design on the fabric. The material is thin- you probably need to layer it."
4.0,It wasn't for me. It was a birthday gift for my cousin.
4.0,they are pretty good quality but they are a bit smaller then my normal size so if you are getting the same size as your current i would go one size up
4.0,"Good socks, but not 100% no show. Especially for boat shoes."
4.0,"Super cute, but the nosepiece is a little low...so the glasses sit just a bit high on my face when pushed all the way up. Aside from that I like them."
4.0,"This dress is so high-quality; I was really impressed. I paired it with a black chunky heel peep-toe sandal and it looked amazing! I am a size 12/14 and I ordered an XL. Usually, L fits me but I think the material would have made an L a little too tight. This dress is so unique and it's also a really good conversation starter. I'm glad I found it!"
4.0,"They are mostly as claimed, and one can expect what they see. My -only- issue is that one has slightly more stretchiness than the other. I am happy with this product and do recommend it."
4.0,Order a size up the shirt came not ripped or anything bad just a little snug and kinda didn’t fit so just order a size up
4.0,Ordered the ring for my son. Its great !! Arrived quickly !!! Have ordered before and same result !!!! Got a tiny chip
4.0,"Want to love it, but the size goes small, have to return it :("
4.0,"The dress is cute and comfortable, but beware the front it's on the really short side."
4.0,"Great service, love my new belly button ring"
4.0,If you are looking for something a little bit looser and not too short these are for you! My absolute favorite new shorts! For reference I am 5’2” about 130 athletic  build they are a little bigger in the front and perfect length. Being a mother of 3 I love the length they are not so short that my checks hang out but also not down to my knees.
4.0,"Nice looking, warm, pretty quiet fabric and well made"
4.0,"This swimsuit looks really cute and provide good coverage. However the size S is too large for me . I am 5”1 and 105lbs. Also the padding inside has no support at all, more like just a cover . For anyone with big chest this one might  not be a good choice."
4.0,"This would get 5 stars for me but they are too tight and  if I wear them for more than 2 days in a row my ear gets infected.  However, it has not degraded at all.  Usually if I wear cheap earrings that happens but material is good.  The hinge is a little flimsy."
4.0,"I really love the style! It's absolutely adorable and looks as pictured! However, when sitting, it is a little uncomfortable since the cut-outs feel like they were cut a little jagged-like, making my legs a little itchy. It is not unbearable, just a minor inconvenience. Other than that, I love this dress!"
4.0,"This dress was good for the price. It runs pretty true to size. I ordered a large thinking it would run a little small, and it was just a bit roomy. The material is comfortable but had a bit of a faded look to it, making it more casual."
4.0,"Bought the shorts in the store and really loved them so I decided to get the pants, wish they had the same button details but there comfy amd the fit of the pants is the same as the shorts"
4.0,perfect for slacks
4.0,"This was nice but short for me. Had to get necklace extender, but now it hangs where Id like it to."
4.0,Arrived on time in a special carrying case. They work okay. They do not make things crisper and clearer but do block out the bright sunlight and your eyes feel better when they are on.
4.0,"I ordered this rosary for free in exchange for my honest review and I love it. St. Francis is my patron saint so I was anxious to get this rosary. I collect rosaries and have many but for some reason I don’t have one of my patron saint so I was very happy to get this. The rosary is well made and looks very nice. The beads are plastic but they have a bit of a “shiny” look to them that I like. The center piece and crucifix are metal and look great too. I have received free rosaries from various Catholic organizations and they metal pieces are a very thin cheap material, this is a step up from that, this isn’t thin or weak like that type. It is a plastic bead rosary but it’s still very sturdy and well made and I think it looks really nice. The stamping of the letters is nice and clear too. I love when a rosary includes details like this.<br />This would make a great gift as well, it comes in a small drawstring storage bag and inside of a gift box. So it’s completely ready to be gifted (I would even feel comfortable shipping this to the recipients house since it would need any extra gift wrapping if you didn't want to).<br />Overall I am really happy with this and am happy to have this as part of my collection, it will be cherished!"
4.0,"I'm going to give this item a 4 because of the size. Definitely order 1-2 sizes smaller than what you would usually wear. I'm 5'2&#34; and weigh 130 and I wear a small in unisex t-shirts and a size 6-8 in jeans. I ordered a small to wear to a wedding and it was pretty baggy on me, so it looked a bit awkward. Finding a belt to pair it with would probably help some. Aside from the size being off this dress is still very cute and light. I would not advise this dress if you're looking for something warmer as the fabric is extremely breathable. It is best as a summer/warm fall day dress."
4.0,Just a little too small and the fabric feels kinda cheap and is pretty see through
4.0,Love the dress! Had to resize the chest part so it wouldn't keep falling down. Also had acouple shipping hiccups with this seller. But Amazon took care of it. Love the dress though.
4.0,"Black Diamond's size chart placed my hand at the upper end of men's small.  I comfortably wear small in various models of mitt from Gordini and Burton.  This was a bit tight in a small.  They will likely stretch some due to all-leather outer, but even then, there would be very little insulation on the sides of my hand.  They seem well-constructed."
4.0,"We ordered a medium and a large. Both fit as expected for each of us. However, they came with absolutely no tags, no msrkings whatsoever. We had to put them on top of each other to figure out which was which. Yes. I did think this would have been a lititle more soft. My description said cotton and spandex not chiffon . How do you wash these? No instructions no tags. Would have been a 5 star if not for that."
4.0,"I bought this because I always have a hard time trying to find my keys in my bag in the dark. I only have a couple problems with this product. 1. The leather is a little on the thick side, which normally I would think is great, but it makes it difficult to press the buttons. 2. Unless it's been sitting in the light for a little while, it doesn't really glow much."
4.0,"Love the bag!  It's mid-sized (not too large) and seems made very sturdy. The design looks just as pictured and the stitching seems like it's very nice quality. I also love the round shape, it's so unique. Can't go wrong for the price, it was $12 and change when I ordered it.  The T-Shirt & Jeans brand has always been a favorite of mine.. their bags are always fashionable and very affordable.  Unfortunately, the delivery put a damper on this order.. literally.  The box was left out in the pouring rain on my steps, even though I have an overhang on my door.. that is less than 2ft away from where the box was left.  The item inside did come slightly wet, mainly the straps, but they are not damaged thankfully.  Very poor delivery.. this is becoming the norm every time I receive an order that is delivered by Amazon. I pay for Prime and receive free shipping.. does that translate into ""I'm just going to throw your packages at your house from now on and not care if the items end up damaged?"" Next time I'll still order the bag because it's awesome, just from somewhere else!"
4.0,Nice and cozy. I bought my brother one too. I just wish it had a zipper. Breeze goes between the buttons.
4.0,"Cute set. Loved that they great are light weight. My only concern is the dangle pairs pierce the ear so tightly it harmed my kids ear lobe. I think if the Clío was thicker, less pressure on the lobe."
4.0,I get more compliments on this watch than others that cost much more.  It has a very unique look and the styling is eye-popping.  The watch is inexpensive but not cheap.  The leather band is good quality and soft.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Unique and gets tons of compliments<br />Inexpensive but not cheap<br />Keeps time perfectly<br /><br />Cons:<br />A little bulky<br /><br />Bottom line:  I would buy again - I have new respect for Kenneth Cole watches.
4.0,"I love these shorts and now have 2 pairs. Good fit, quality, etc. I bought both my pairs on sale for ~$45 if I recall. List price is outrageous. I love the smaller hip pocket for keys, etc. The only problem is the clasp (buckle) for the belt. Whoever designed it was a moron that never tested it with gloves on or even standing around the house. It goes in easy but taking it out is a major PITA. The concept is good but then they added a bottom tab that is virtually impossible to unlatch when the the buckle is in one of the adjustment pockets."
4.0,I like the bracelet but theres really not much I can do to adjust it
4.0,I have had these for about a year and still going strong!
4.0,"I really like the way these look.  Very black, solidly striking.  Unisex.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like others have mentioned, I'm unable to wear them because of the curve of the part that goes through your ear.  I managed to get it through one ear but the other not at all.<br /><br />I've looked around on Amazon for something similar but with a straight ear post and can't find anything.  After seeing in person how these &#34;could&#34; look, I'm disappointed that I can't wear them."
4.0,Liked it.  a bit heavy for extended use
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 126lbs, 34B, 25&#34;, 37&#34; and ordered a large. The dress fits loose in my midsection, but it's very short! It reaches just below my bum so I keep this dress limited to beach days/nights. Other than that, I love the fun print and it's very comfy."
4.0,"They were too tight for me, otherwise a good product. Returned them with NO hassles."
4.0,Very pretty polyester clingy fabric and a plunging v neck that showed way more than I should.<br />I ordered xxx and say to small on bust. I am a 40DDD.
4.0,"Doesn't leak, so it does what I need it to do. I just wish the clips were a little easier to deal with. They over-rotate when open so it is hard to get them lined up to close the pouch. This is minor, but annoying."
4.0,"The thick straps kind of dig into my shoulders. it might be that I'm still working on the adjustment, but I'm not sure I like that. There's also small details on the bra like the center part has a decorative hanging fake jewel ornament. It might not get in the way, but I feel it might be scratchy should the temperature turns warmer."
4.0,Very cute! Planning as a gift.
4.0,I DON'T LIKE A &#34;REQUIRED AMOUNT OR WORDS&#34; Bjksl HUIa  DBAS io HDS uio GDAS OI UGAI HUDIK HGDAS GHUAI
4.0,Ughhh I love it only thing is that its short like belly button length an it sucks because it looks different in the picture but overall I love it I'm a USA 9 ordered an xl and it was perfect again only thing was the length.
4.0,Fits perfectly . But has NO LACE in the slit as pictured . They need to remove the pic of the lace. It’s misleading . Perfect to wear with tights .
4.0,Dress was a little bigger than expected but overall fabric quality was good.
4.0,"Whenever I buy a costume I expect kind of crappy material, this one wasn't too bad. My daughter did not once complain about it being itchy. A few loose strings but it was easily fixable"
4.0,"5'4"", 140 lbs. I bought the medium and it's perfect.  The material looked thick in photos, but it's actually kind of thin.  Which is no biggie, just wear a camisole under it. It's not clingy in the stomach area, which I love because, well... kids and carbs.  You can dress it up or dress it down, and it pairs great with leggings."
4.0,Cute but too big if you have small face
4.0,Love the colors<br />Love the material<br />Little bit roomy for size but ok
4.0,"Cute and useful, and keeps up well"
4.0,Positives:<br />~looks and feels like real hair<br />~color was spot on<br />~curls well in tact<br />~the netting was black (makes the netting less noticeable when the hair is parted)<br />~the bangs were very full and the netting does not show no matter how I parted them<br />~adjustable with hooks in the back<br />~comes with a wig cap<br /><br />Negatives:<br />~the wig was a little sparse around the top half of the back and on the ear flaps<br />~the bangs were very long (past my chin) but they could easily be trimmed
4.0,Beautiful but came apart.
4.0,"I really like this purse.  Leather is great, it has places for credit cards and a zip section that opens.  I really wanted it in brown, but I ended up with eggplant.  I found the brown after I had placed my order, but I'm not sending it back, I really like the style."
4.0,Love the fit love the colors and the design of the materials
4.0,I really like this one! I am 5'3 and 120 pounds. It was a little tight but i think the next size up would be too big. It would be great for a spring wedding or something if you have an event to attend.
4.0,I really like this dress<br />The waist is perfect however the length of the torso is a tiny bit short so the halter strap pulls a bit even in an XL..<br />I get lots of compliments on this dress wherever I go so it's worth it ;)
4.0,Pro: They don't move or fall off when I sleep. I’ll most likely purchase these again sometime soon.<br />Cons: Color fades.
4.0,Nice linen. Good for beach.
4.0,"These are good hoops but the gold color is misleading. I expected to receive gold hoops but, instead I got a multicolored one. They are thin but not thin so it's perfect if you're just switching your piercing for the first time. They can be tightened also which is a plus"
4.0,Very badly glares!!!
4.0,The headband is comfortable.  The wings are a bit tight around the shoulders for an adult but it works.
4.0,The fit was perfect but I’m only 4’9 so this made the dress too long.
4.0,Not as I expected. Smaller beads than I thought. It looks great though. I used it to dress out a horned bull skull and it looks great!
4.0,"The top is a casual pretty top.  Good price.  Watch the sizing.  I am 5'5"", 140 lbs and a 34DDD and ordered a small.  It's still slightly large on me."
4.0,Great. Mine was a Large
4.0,I used this product to wear for my baby shower as maternity dress. It for very well I ordered at 2x which larger that my Normal size but I didn’t want the chest area to be too snug. It’s perfect length and I’m about 5”3.
4.0,"About half a size too big, but it's a beautiful dress.  I wore it to an afternoon wedding reception and it was the perfect outfit.  I'm 5'4 and the dress was the perfect length with 3 inch heels (medium). For girls that are a little taller, they may run into some issues, especially when wearing heels."
4.0,"I am very satisfied with this purchase. They are very comfortable. I bought an XL and they are a perfect fit, 5'1"" and 180 lbs. I would buy another pair."
4.0,"I ordered this band in the champagne color, once it arrived the band color was a rose pink color. I kept the band even though the color was clearly not the champagne color illustrated on page, because I liked it.  I then ordered the champagne band again, thinking it was a mistake, however I received the same rose pink color again! This one will be returned.  The band is easy to size, and comfortable, nice looking, and only time will tell how durable it will be."
4.0,"The dress is very pretty and fits great (for reference, I am 5'1 and 118 lbs and I ordered a small) however I am returning it because it is wayyy too long. I have on 4 inch heels and the dress is still an inch too long. This dress will be great for someone who is taller."
4.0,The stones are barely visibil in reality.  But my Grandaughter loved it.  Perfect for a four year old.
4.0,Unstructured but what I wanted
4.0,The earrings are beautiful. The only con is the lever works very hard.
4.0,"Why advertise something is Polish, when it is made in Germany? Especially something military? Aside from that it is high quality, and I hope it breathes well"
4.0,"This Nightmare Before Christmas sweatshirt is nice. The colors are vibrant & the material is good. Although, the sizing was on the small side. I still gave it as a gift & my daughter loved it."
4.0,nice but a bit thin
4.0,My son loves these jammies.
4.0,These are beautiful heart shaped earrings. They were very carefully packaged . My only little thing I will mention is that they are smaller than they look in the model’s ears. Still nice though
4.0,Very nice product. Fits well and are comfortable to wear. Helps with the fatigue and discomfort I have when on my feet for an extended period of time.
4.0,"Cute, would buy again"
4.0,Love this it's super soft on the inside and silky on the outside unfortunately I've noticed pilling on the material at the end of 1 days wear :(
4.0,Love this ring. Only issue is that it is a little bit to big. I think this is due to the fact that my other ring I wore left a dent on my finger.
4.0,I like these but you can’t wear a patterned bra with them because they’re see through
4.0,"Cute but sized extremely small. If your a 6 get an 8 or even a 10 and then return the one that does not fit. Not much give. Nice for the money. Not very expensive looking, but not terrible either. Good for a party night, New Years Eve, but not a wedding."
4.0,Excellent long underwear. My only gripe is --why all the sporty logos and markings? It's UNDERWEAR hello! I'd prefer it to be all black with no more than one discrete logo
4.0,"OK. Overall I like the watch. It's got a decent band with plenty TY of holes for my small wrists. The watch is very thin so not for people who prefer big watches. It's got a nice classy look and so far performs great and fits nice and I'm happy I received one free for an honest review.<br /><br />Cons. I for the life of me can't figure out why the hour hand is a VERY deep red color. You can BARELY see it even outside in the sun but you can see it. I side the house in the evening I can't see it at all unless I hold it up under a light so that makes it really IMO a very odd color choice to even color the hour hand. It should be left white to match the second and minute hands. Another thing is the second hand is much larger than the minute hand. Usually the second hand that ticks is the skinniest because it's usually the most irrelevant hand to see unless it's a chronograph watch which this isn't.<br /><br />Overall the look is slick and I like the pattern behind the glass etc, all that is cool but the hour hand illegibility makes it hard to give it a five star so I'm giving it a 4 for great looks, a nice slim fit if you don't want to bang a big watch in walls and such but it's still pretty cool looking so I'd still wear it out to dinner when dressed up etc. But PKEASE change the hour hand to white or silver. That was a poor design choice big-time.<br /><br />My honest review. Thank you."
4.0,"Very pretty necklace! took a star off because a clasp holding one of the jewels on fell off day one. It was an easy fix, though."
4.0,I got my rings  yesterday. And they are cute. No problems with the fit!!!  I'm happy.
4.0,I like the different styles but you have to make sure the closure is snug otherwise it'll easily slip off
4.0,Nice replacement lens
4.0,happy with it.
4.0,"I bought this dress because I bought a similar one a couple of months ago and wanted another. The one I had previously purchased was the Laksmi version: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XJTLQSM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  The dresses are almost identical. This LouKeith version of the dress is light, relatively thin fabric, which is nice for the summer but does show lines/curves very easily.  The Laksmi dress is thicker, and so is a little more flattering, but is less appealing to wear on a hot summer day.  Both tags say 95% rayon / 5% spandex.<br /><br />I'm currently nursing/breastfeeding and both of these dresses are PERFECT for it!  The dress pulls down easily.  The front can also be arranged differently for slightly different looks.  The thinner LouKeith version seems to stretch out just slightly, but it isn't a deal breaker.  I give this 4/5 stars because I think, overall, the Laksmi version is a little nicer.<br /><br />I'm 5'-10&#34;, 190 lbs, and I bought a large."
4.0,"Nice coat, looks good, and is warm"
4.0,Dress is as pictured but I ordered a size up and it was still a little snug. So order up a size or two!
4.0,Very cute!  Smaller than I thought.  Would definitely fit a child and I hope that they will stretch to fit my friends.
4.0,"They were bigger round than I thought they’d be, otherwise nice"
4.0,if your an xl get large
4.0,I bought this for my roommate who is 5’ 10”. The length of the skirt is short in her so she will have to wear shorts or stretch pants underneath. I would not recommend for super curvy girls.
4.0,"This scarf is very warm and looks pretty good. The only drawback I can come up with is that, being wool, it's somewhat itchy. Still a very nice scarf, though."
4.0,A little bit scratchy around the band but true to size. Overall a great value
4.0,i’m a 34B and medium shirt size but got a size small and it wasn’t too tight and had some room but would recommend sizing down if you have smaller a chest like me because i had to pull it up the whole night. Great material and perfect for a cheap party outfit. No fringes in back
4.0,Did not receive the colors pictured
4.0,I really wanted to love this bathing suit the colors are great and vibrant the material is nice and thick but it is made Forbes short torso.  I have a very full breast and it does covers it all but for some reason the top part pushes the breast down and it makes it look weird and like spread to the sides.... Not a good fit for me!
4.0,I get lots of compliments on these. Easy to breathe in  Dry quickly after washing. Pretty colors. They do make you look a little like the genie from I Dream of ..
4.0,I purchased this it was scary I love my hair but this helps keep me from losing extra locks while I sleep thoe the pic is deceptive the is a big hole in the middle so you can wear it like a mask or a bennie it looks good as a headband as well. the fabric is soft and it is easy to get used to while u sleep alto I was scared to buy this I am glad iI did.<br />and hope that soon I won't need it at all
4.0,This is such a cute and fun dress! Perfect for summer time. I got both the green and black but need to wear a slip under b/c when the light hits on me a certain way you can see through it. Very comfy and fun! Will be getting more colors!
4.0,"Purchased as a gift, so I'm guessing the fit will be OK.  The tiny bodysuits are adorable & every new mom can never have too many onesies, I'm told."
4.0,"It’s lightweight, cute and comfortable."
4.0,"Not a bad looking watch band. Comfort gets 4 stars. It's not the worst band I've worn, but not the most comfortable either. I wanted something like this because most bands with holes are either too loose or too tight. This band is metal and has a magnet to secure it. I find that it slips and eventually loosens over the course of normal movement. It's not a strong grip, you know? Overall, this watch band is ok. Not great, but not horrible either. Definitely middle of the road."
4.0,"Got it on a whim.  Unique.  It Is sturdy, and very cute."
4.0,"Bought it for my daughter. She loves it.  It actually came in earlier than expected,"
4.0,They look small but they aren't. They are comfortable dont lose shape or sag. I prefer dark colors so went with blue have washed several times since purchase and they are still nice.
4.0,"I really love the way this ring looks and fits. I was tired of the normal boring rings. This is extremely tough to get on tho, but it is possible."
4.0,"These fit well but the brown lens were a little darker than what appeared on the website. The arms are on the short side so if the distance from your eyes to your ears is longer than normal, like my me, then they might feel a little short."
4.0,"Constructed well, very cute but it is small. Enough room for valuables, a book and snacks but a standard beach towel won't fit."
4.0,these scarves are very thin.  They have beautiful patterns.
4.0,Scarf was what you would expect for the price. Not bad for the money.
4.0,Again I love it!!! Runs small next time get 2 sizes bigger
4.0,Happy that I bought it...the necklace is kinda short though. But i really like it. The charm is also smaller than I thought it would be
4.0,Was a nice “first” outfit.
4.0,I would have given this dress 5 stars but for the slight discomfort I have around my neck region due to the high front &#34;collar&#34;
4.0,"Good quality, sorry a little small"
4.0,"Perfect fit, and exactly the level of warmth I was looking for. Only criticism is that the fingers aren't dexterous enough. It's a combination of how they're sown at the finger tips, and that the outer layer of material seems somewhat loose compared to the inside throughout the whole glove. Very nice gloves, but I can't remove my wallet without taking one off."
4.0,"Adorable pants, much too long but she can get by wearing them and rolling the cuffs. Hopefully they will last long enough that when they fit properly they won't be worn out."
4.0,I bought it for a young girl that needed a long slip.  It fit her very well and she says it works well.
4.0,Good alternative to a bulky scarf. Keeps your neck warm & is cozy soft.
4.0,its a belt it keeps pants up. I needed it a bit darker for the wedding tho.
4.0,"I got a size small. I'm 5'6&#34; about 140 and I should have ordered a medium. Not sure why I ordered a small, but they fit fine, I notice I was pulling them up a lot but that could have been because they were a tad too small. They're very comfortable though!"
4.0,So far it is working well and has lasted longer than any of the others we've tried. If it continues to work we will be happy.
4.0,"Product is great quality! Looks exactly like pictures. They fit my reading glasses, but am having issues with my Rayban sunglasses.  The opening is too tight to easily put a pair of sunglasses with a large temple tips in. Only reason I took away a star. Will try to stretch them to fit..."
4.0,"The band is not bad considering the price. It looks nice, the magnets are very strong and it feels secure. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the watch/band makes a rattling sound when my phone rings which is kind of annoying."
4.0,A little smaller than expected but she loved it
4.0,"Sweater looks as it does on the model -- except the arm holes are higher up than I realized exposing more skin than is appropriate for the office and you need to wear a halter or strapless bra or straps will show.  For the office I wear a cardigan with it.  The sweater is made of a light fabric that makes it perfect for spring/summer and it's smooth to the touch.  I bought the medium and it fit me perfectly -- I am 5'7"", 125 lbs.  I will buy it in a couple more colors."
4.0,"So, I finally broke down and bought some packing cubes for our last trip. It is fun to have something new when you go on a trip,<br />and I didn't need anything else.<br /><br />I did like them, I kind of wished the cubes were different colors. When we did laundry, I put the clothes back into<br />the correct cube instead of just in the suitcase, Generally I use gallon size baggies for smaller items. The grey<br />plastic &#34;cube&#34; turned out to be real handy for me. The laundry bag is maybe adequate for a skinny three year old, I used it<br />for my husband's shoes.<br /><br />Glad I bought them."
4.0,"Nice, nice hat. Definitely keeps your head warm. If there is anything to know it is that I wear 7 5/8&#34; backpacks and this winter hat was ever so slightly loose. Still a good hat IMO."
4.0,"Rather stiff leather product. Glasses fit nicely in the case that is not lined. There is a pressed logo on the front of the case. Personally I prefer a soft leather case, it takes up less room but this is good for an environment where the glasses are knocked around, perhaps a briefcase or luggage."
4.0,These are great masks for outdoor use!
4.0,Nice jacket. I would have loved it more if it were just a bit larger. It was tight in the arms. Nice color and fabric.
4.0,Smaller than expected but the kids loved them.  We used them as party favors for an emoji themed birthday.
4.0,The hat is a little small however it will be alright.  I can say that it came on time with no problems.
4.0,"Love this! Good fit tho a bit large. Great pattern, good weight to fabric. Will get lots of wear."
4.0,"The fit and style of this shirt is great- however they don't mention the actual material- they just call it comfortable and silky.  So if you are looking for a cozy natural material waffle shirt this is not it.  It isn't a deal breaker for me because it does look really good!  :P  Definitely not for lounging for me.  Next time I'm looking for something online however, I will be more careful to make sure what I am buying is actually a natural material --even if I put that in the search bar it doesn't mean that is what will appear."
4.0,Slightly large. Made well.
4.0,"So cute! Colors are vibrant and print is very well made. My son received as a gift and loves it!! Only reason I am giving 4 stars is because the strings are not a solid color as in the pictures. The hoodie we received has rainbow strings, which stand out as a complete contrast to the hoodie itself.  Also could have done one size smaller, but he’ll grow into it!"
4.0,"Worked up a sweat trying to put it on! With some adjustments in the ribbon it fit well! The ribbon is low quality, but pulled as tight as they are, the wrinkles are absent. I ordered a medium, my bust is 36 inches, waist is 29-30, and hips are 37 inches. I am a bit chubby in my belly so I want to start waist training with this. So far just from the get-go I notice how nicely it squeezes me, and it is crazy comfortable. Definitely wont be difficult to wear this for long periods of time, besides of course the putting on. Maybe it's just because im a rookie at clasping these things but it was a huge hassle haha. Above and below the buttons/clasps are an odd little folding/damaged area, seems to be because there is a section of fabric that surpasses the boning. Wearing pants slightly above the bottom as well as having underboob hides it, and for the price it is definitely not a big issue. Seems to be pretty good buy that'll at least hold me over long enough to buy one of those custom designed corsets. We all know how crazy expensive that is haha! Overall definitely look at sizing and for slightly bigger measurements you can simply loosen the ribbon. :)"
4.0,Fits as expected and I love that they are lightweight since my son tends to sweat even in cooler weather.
4.0,"I thought this ran a little small. I gave it away, but really liked it. The quality isn't great, but it is just meant to be a holiday top, so it is fine for the couple of times a year you might wear it. I would buy it again, but just size up."
4.0,"I'm 5 8"" and this is not long enough. It's quite decent, it's made well but I have to wear it really low on my hips for it to be near the floor like I wanted. If I wasn't in Jamaica I would've returned it."
4.0,"These short women's dress ankle socks are fairly lightweight, but are still substantial enough to wear with my low, walking around sneakers or other casual shoes. I really would not wear these with my running shoes or in my boots because they would be too thin and the strenuous movement or rubbing against higher cut footwear would probably make them slip down. The socks do not bind and seem to fit my size range correctly. They also launder fine without much shrinkage of the fabric (cotton/poly/spandex). It's handy that these come in a 3-pack.  While these are not the socks for dress wear or athletics, they still serve a necessary part of my casual wear. I generally use these as my everyday or weekend casual socks when I'm just running errands or don't want to go around the house in bare feet."
4.0,Workout top is nice. Ordered an XXS for reference I weigh 103 pds. Little loose & sleeves are a little long but overall it fits nice.
4.0,"as shown, there's way too much cleavage. i ended up wrapping it around and tying in back. worked like a charm"
4.0,It’s a super cute and stretchy. Looks just like the picture. I do recommend
4.0,It's lovely. I've gotten many compliments on it. Material is stretchy and the fit is forgiving.
4.0,Good slippers.  Use them on my Rv and like the rubber soles
4.0,But it's exactly what I wanted
4.0,This was bigger and it looked tight in the picture but it's looser than I would have expected but I absolutely love my sweater so much.
4.0,The watch bands are beautiful and comfortable.  I like how it has a ribbed design.  It is waterproof and drys fast!
4.0,Art class will love creating paper mache masks. Reusable and light weight. Quick delivery
4.0,It looks cute and many people love them but the only bad part is the elastic that hold the slippers are too tight. My wife removes the elastic and it fits perfectly.
4.0,I like it and wear to church.
4.0,It has a weird smell that doesn't faint easily. And it itches your wrist. It's still cute though!
4.0,"Band isn't as stiff as the band that came with the fitbit, it's definitely more flexible.  It's held up well though and I haven't had any problems.  Was well worth the money to get this band rather than spend an extra $50-100 to get the grey fitbit.  #winning"
4.0,"Great undies, they serve their purpose. I marked down one star because the white one came with a stain that I cannot remove even after several washes."
4.0,They are good to help my day throug without sore legs. Love them. Thank you.
4.0,Fit is somewhat small in length.
4.0,"I received a ton of compliments on this cute little, sexy, thing.  It hugged my hips and curves perfectly.  The fabric is a bit see-threw, but comfortable.  Fabric could have been of better quality, but can't get upset at the price.  I can wear it all summer, White Parties, here I come."
4.0,It is a cute and open style. It will be more suitable to be worn o n thiner finger.
4.0,I love these pants!! They are so soft I want to wear them day and night.  The look is true to the picture. Unless you are very tall you WILL have to hem them but they are worth a little hemming.  The size chart runs big so you may want to order one size smaller.  I would have given 5 stars if not for them being so long but after hemming to get right length you will never want to take them off.
4.0,Super cute pattern. Its soft and fits perfectly except for the chest is super wide so its a bit baggy on my daughter. The length and arms fit great.
4.0,It was pretty torturous getting these on and I had quite the struggle. Once I finally got them up they did fit.  They are tight on my thighs but not so much that it is uncomfortable or hard to move. I do not like the location of the seams on the booty and can feel them on the backs of my thighs. The tights are fairly stretchy (except on my thighs) and I do like how opaque they are.
4.0,"Had this band for a few months and for the price you probably can’t beat it.  Band is holding up well so far. Only complaint is how much it loosens up when wet, but any textile band would likely do the same thing."
4.0,"Good construction and a bit more elegant than the run of the mill masks. I've moved on to lighter ones with ear loops, vs string now, but these are my go to, if the others are dirty."
4.0,Great value for kids who have a propensity for destroying things. My son uses these for running and playing softball league but he has a narrow face.
4.0,This is a beautiful dress I bought it for my court wedding and it’s beautiful just a very awkward top I am medium I got size 6 but the bust seems to be larger and a little stiff but still really nice. Won’t be returning because it’s too close to the date but if I had the chance I would return and get another dress form the same company with a different bust.
4.0,Run a couple sizes small. Quality and durability is great.
4.0,"I like the shirts, but not for compression purposes. They are too large for that but will be great for just a comfortable shirt to wear with jeans!<br />I just ordered one size smaller for my compression needs. They should arrive today!"
4.0,"The product is great, very sexy. The only problem is that when cinched down a couple of the little holes started to tear. Other than that it was a great purchase"
4.0,"Its superb, looks great and make you feel comfortable. Package shipment and delivery was cool. Thanks Amazon"
4.0,"Very Pretty, but shows scratches easily. I am used to Tungsten."
4.0,worked pretty well. just really hard to get that little peice of metal into the loop.
4.0,"Nice size stone. However, nice to have wider ring diameter to balance the size of the stone. Love the color of the stone."
4.0,Thin Lycra yet helps a great deal with the cold and wind chill.  Afterwards just though it in the wash and your ready for another journey.
4.0,"The only downside was the feathers covered the right eye a bit, but was able to bend and snip them so I could see. otherwise great purchase for the price. Will be used for a masquerade holiday party."
4.0,These ear muffs are very warm. My only criticism is that the top piece is plastic and easily twists when off.
4.0,Life saver during pregnancy!
4.0,"The skirt fit perfectly but I probably should have gotten an extra small shirt. I’m 5’4”, 128 lbs, and a 34B."
4.0,"Does not block total noise, still can hear my husband snoring. They r comfortable."
4.0,"True to size. Washed & dried beautifully. Bought one for myself and one for a gift. Like the design & style, not so much the fabric."
4.0,I really like these shorts but sizing is always a struggle with them coming from out of the country.  If your normally a medium get xl if your normally a larger get xxl
4.0,"So I was tricked a little by this products. In the picture of the model the bottoms come up above her navel. Well when I tried this on they’re not high waisted at all, but that’s okay. I still like it and I’m wearing it for vacation. I’m typically a L-XL more so cause of the girls. I did buy this in an xl."
4.0,"wouldnt wear it in freezing weather, but on a 40-50* day its perfect"
4.0,I like that it holds both cheques and cards. It does set off security at the airport TSA checkpoint (as a good RFID blocking wallet should).
4.0,"Because of this I would rather rate 3.5. Also, it is plastic. 😕"
4.0,"Cute necklace and fair quality for the price.  Pleasantly surprised that it came with matching earrings!  Great, true-red color (not orangey).  The necklace probably won’t last long, but it’s held up for the four times I’ve worn it so far."
4.0,"Love this dress, it looks fantastic on. Fits beautifully. Would pay more if it were lined."
4.0,"The bracelet is put together well, it's light and bouncy, and my niece is going to love it.  This is the season to wear this."
4.0,I order the wrong size but the hat is still sweet
4.0,"I bought this hoodie for work (I work at target and I wanted something to keep me warm). It has a pretty decent quality. I had small fuzzies falling off of the hoodie after the first few washes, but I haven’t noticed it since then. I read other reviews that said to size up, so I got a medium because I’m normally a small. The medium fit perfectly!"
4.0,"I loved the style! Super cute! The length was okay and the material was a “heavy” material. However, I am 5’4” 135 pounds, I ordered a small the waist fit perfect but the legs were a bit baggy for my liking."
4.0,"Lightweight, shiny, cute skulls. I like these earrings for the most part. They are pretty and a nice color with good shine. They are lightweight and eye catching. My few cons are that I have filigree earrings this same weight and color that just recently broke that were bigger than these earrings and the same quality but I only paid 1/3 of This price for those earrings. So value for money isn’t the best. But I couldn’t find those earrings to repurchase so I went for these. I have a matching necklace and really needed a replacement so I bought these. I do like them a lot though. So I don’t care too much that I may have overpaid."
4.0,"The exterior of the bag is very high end, and yes, there is lots of pocket room, but I noticed that I’m going to have to be gentle with the interior material zippers. The three interior compartment’s fabric is almost like a low quality rain jacket. I expect the exterior of the bag to last. If/when the interior compartments start to tear or not function, I’ll probably just gut the bag and continue to use it. The exterior of the bag looks extremely expensive."
4.0,Love this bag. Great quality.
4.0,Me encanta este producto ya los tengo en todos los colores
4.0,"Great quality material, unfortunately size ran a little small."
4.0,Believe it works.
4.0,I liked the looks of this slipper.  I thought it might be a little plusher but was happy with the ability to machine wash it.  Got it for our 4 year old granddaughter.
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings. The opal has a decidedly pink tint to it. It also comes with clear plastic backs, if you'd rather use them than the original backs.<br /><br />I didn't realize when I ordered these that they are plated, and I can't wear plated jewelry. The plating wears off in a few hours, and then it makes me itch."
4.0,"Of course, these are using fish hook style earrings to attach the tassels and they are not sterling silver or stainless steel. So, with that knowledge, you wear them for an event and remove them if they start to irritate your ears. These are cute, long and dangling. The multi green color is nice and will work with a number of colors."
4.0,My 3rd set of this brand of socks. They are better than the normal no show socks. I just bought a pair for my dad who wears boat shoes a lot .
4.0,"Very attractive masks with classy look.  Also, very comfortable to wear."
4.0,The straps are a little big but the size in length and width is true-to-size. If I had &#34;taller&#34; feet these would fit perfectly. I have to curl my toes to keep them on. I like how they look though. I feel bad giving anyone less than 4 stars.
4.0,This dress is sexy and made of quality material. It's runs a little small so i would go a size up but other than that is really hugs your curves and sucks you in. I love it!
4.0,Works great with all the lenses.  Would have given it 5 stars but one of the lenses broke in half while in my pocket.  I must have come in contact with something and didn't want to carry around the beautiful carrying case that was included with the lenses.
4.0,"No complaints honestly. I went with a medium, I’m 5’4 and around 125-130 pounds. The shirt were a little tight in the bottom of you have a little more booty. Other then that, love it"
4.0,The band is comfortable although it comes undone a little too easy. Definitely worth the price though.
4.0,"Really great quality for the price. Material was thick and bright colored, so I'm hoping it will withhold the sun and saltwater."
4.0,Love my socks :)
4.0,Very pretty just not enough pockets in it like I expected.
4.0,Not really true to size but very cute.
4.0,Sandals etching could have been darker.  You have to move it back and forth to visualize the image.  Image needs to stand out more.  I like that there is room for personalisation.  You should think about offering that as well.
4.0,Gives good coverage from the sun!
4.0,"My kids loved them, wouldn’t slip off their heads, comfortable."
4.0,good product and great price.
4.0,"I got this robe for the hot summer months, and it does the job.  The polyester fabric isn't breathable, but it is extremely light and silky, so it feels cool.  The medium size is fine for me (5' 10"", 160 lbs).  It comes to just below my knees.  (The Amazon ad should be clearer that the solid color robes are more than 2"" longer than the pattern robes.)  Only annoying thing is the belt, which is not long enough, hard to tie because the fabric is so slippery, and sits very high on my body because the loops are too high.  Other than that, I'm pleased with this."
4.0,"Loved this dress. Only downfall is the plastic in the tutu skirt started coming apart after first wear. Still looks great, just a bit less poofy. Daughter was very happy."
4.0,"Liked the product - first one I ordered had a hole in it, returned for a new one"
4.0,The color look different in add
4.0,Did not like all black color  Logo was flat looking Team Logo was not SHARP enough  it did not stand out on jersey
4.0,"Just don't wear it in the shower or it will have condensation inside and die on you.  Learned this from previous purchase of this watch.  If you take care of it, it will last two or three years before the band breaks.  Then you can look around for a nice band and wear it another couple of years."
4.0,I like it but the tulle under the dress is very stubborn.
4.0,"Nice bag, a little smaller than I had expected, but still nice."
4.0,We  I needed a mask for Halloween costume and I love that these have the adjustable ear tabs. They seem to work well and hold up fantastically in the wash.
4.0,Nice lightweight vest
4.0,"This chain is pretty and delicate in appearance and the exact size I needed for a charm.  The closure is a little difficult to open & close, but just because it is small."
4.0,Not the most comfortable not the best material but just a bit scratchy material. And the waist is definitely very very tight for a size large. The waist is more like a small - medium. But cute to workout with or the beach
4.0,I was hoping for a  larger one but this works.
4.0,Should have came with extra links
4.0,Look very nice on. Would have got 5 stars but didn't come with the pins
4.0,"This is a very cute wristlet with a fun pattern that seems appropriate for both casual or dressier attire. It also can obviously slip into a purse as a &#34;regular&#34; wallet. The wristlet strap is easily removable. The outer material has a nice &#34;silky&#34; feel to it. My only complaint is there aren't separate compartments like there are in some of the other 31 wristlets. So while I maybe COULD still fit my phone in, it just seems it would be in the way of credit cards and cash. I prefer the two or three compartment styles. Please note I did find the price of this wristlet to be very reasonable compared to other comparable 31 items on Amazon!"
4.0,I made a mistake and read the measurements wrong so this belt was way too tiny for me. So read the sizing information closely!!! I gave it to a friend of mine as a gift and she likes it.<br />Just double check closely to make sure you are getting the right size
4.0,"I've order this twice now. First time no problems, loved everything. The color hasn't faded yet, no problems wearing them. One thing is the color rose gold and gold are very similar. Second time, I'm missing one of the balls on the rose gold, nowhere in package."
4.0,For such a low price it’s great. One of the threads came undone but it’s okay.
4.0,"The finish is a bit dark, almost like stainless steel, even after using silver clothe on it.  It well made and the fit is great.  It is ok but I wish it had more of a shiny silver finish.  It is stamped as .99 silver but the satin finish darkens it."
4.0,Cute but waaaaay bigger than expected
4.0,Well bottom was perfect fit..But the top was just to big on me but hey! I think the grills are meant for men’s not kids teeth but okay.
4.0,This mask is awesome!! It's a little to small for my head but I cut the sides where the mouth opening a little more and it fit better. Still I love it and can't wait to wear it!
4.0,These are so nice! I find they are durable le and perfect for my side gig to give out as my teamies hit goals along the way. I do feel the light blue and light green look almost identical in person though. I wish there was more of a color difference.
4.0,Nice casual comfortable dress. Would be best on someone tall.
4.0,Beautiful shoes but the sizes run too small.
4.0,I have these pants in blacknin a size small and the black size fits perfectly. These blue ones seem a tad big  I hope they don't stretch. They are very nice quality and thick and there is no show through and I love that! I am 5'6&#34; and 130 lbs athletic build and I wear a size small.
4.0,"I found this to be wonderful in the workplace. I don’t have to wear a mask when alone in my office, but found I was almost out the door without my mask. This lanyard kept my mask with me making it easy to put it on immediately."
4.0,This shirt is very comfortable. I ordered a L as I go between a M and L depending on style. I think a M would be a better fit.
4.0,Great cute boot for the price. Going to buy slip-in arch supports though
4.0,loved it and the sparkle and shine is beautiful
4.0,Really pleased
4.0,Not stretchy. If they were a little stretchy they could last longer.
4.0,"I love these my only issue is that some of them arrived bent at the top which is fine and easily fixable. My main issue is that I received 1 less than I was supposed to get. Which doesn't seem like that big of a deal however I have a certain number I need to make for my order and it is super inconvenient. I need the proper amount but I don't want to have to literally return them and wait for a replacement to be shipped...I have a deadline to create my project. I also ordered more than one from the same exact seller and for some reason they were shipped at different times...The initial one arrived last Friday Oct. 29th and the 2nd one should be arriving today according to Amazon so I'm hoping they added the missing one to this order but we'll see if they even noticed. For refence my order was placed October 26th so the 1st batch came 3 days later and the next one will be 6 days later if it does arrive today. So just because you order it together does not mean you will receive it today if you have a deadline. Other than missing one, the slightly bent tops of about 5 of them and them arriving at different times; I am in love with them and cannot wait to use them once my missing one issue is solved. I really hope I won't have to ship it back just to get one..."
4.0,The shorts are great lined them slot. Like the style of the top but was not enough elastic for support to hold.  They said it ran small so I ordered s large. The bottoms were good but the top is small.<br />If your ordering a larger bottom you would think the top would be a close match.
4.0,"I read the reviews and ordered the larger size. It was perfect. Love the look of the coat. Will have to review as the winter goes.<br /><br />Added comments. It is tight under the arms and the arms themselves. Did not realize this until I put something heavy on and tried to put the coat on. Don't know if this is how the coat is cut, or a defect in mine. I do like the coat, but am bummed I cannot wear a sweater under it. I hope I hear from Orolay about this. Changing my stars to 4"
4.0,"I recently purchased this beautiful piece.  It fits comfortably and looks stunning!!  It is a solid cuff with no seams that might snag clothing or irritate skin.  I wore it with a bunch of thin gold tone bangle bracelets and received several compliments.  The colors aren't quite as vibrant as what is pictured, but still perfectly attractive.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that after a few hours of wearing it, i ended up with a green ring where it was sitting higher on my forearm.  I will keep wearing it and make sure it moves freely so that it doesn't leave that nasty mark.  I received this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"they fit well , my only complaint is that i can definitely feel the embroidery on my inner thighs."
4.0,Looking for a shirt that was similar to my old Puma golf shirt - this was great.
4.0,"Let me just say first off, I love it!<br />Ok, I ordered a 12/18 months so it runs small. My baby is 9/12 months right now. So she won’t be wearing it long. It fits perfect! The only thing I have to say bad is the ties are way to short. I may see if I can replace them. My babies weight is 19 pounds."
4.0,I love the dress on but ran small. I'm usually a large but it was too tight. I'm just going to reorder an extra large.
4.0,Love the look it looks great the only reason I give it a 4 star is because the part that sits on the watch when you work out it fogs up so you can’t tap your Apple Watch other than that everything is lovely and you could always take a part off if you need to work out in it Very fashionable and cute would recommend it to anybody!!!
4.0,The skirt’s quality was decent. It wasnt uncomfortable but it is quite short if you have thicker thighs. It isnt see through which is very good considering it is white. Overall the skirt is cute and its perfect for the summer.
4.0,"A gift, a charm, and wonderful piece from a classic piece of literature. She enjoyed it and I've heard only excellent things."
4.0,Nice. Fits my face well.
4.0,"I like it so far.  Its bigger than I thought and takes up a lot of room in my purse.  However, I like the way it is made and it holds a lot of cards.  I only gave it 4 stars because, I dont know how effective it is .  I just rec'd it in the later part of December."
4.0,Incredible detailed charm!
4.0,Love the design but is not a exact fit... My son likes it's but fits like a muscle shirt
4.0,I am usually pretty worried about how shorts will fit me and how it allows me to move. These shorts fit me very well(40ish waist) AND allow me to move around a lot without shifting. The elastic sections are well placed and it provides plenty of pocket space. We'll see how it handles a few days at Disney World!
4.0,"Lovely skirt, perfect length but the waist is tiny. I ordered a Small, I’m usually a size 4 and this is very tight around the waist. Otherwise happy with this purchase."
4.0,Great material and quality but I should've gone 1 size up in these leggings.
4.0,I wish they were all the same color. But it’s not that big of a deal. My son likes the smiley face.
4.0,"When I first got this I actually had got the wrong hoodie, the wrong one looked nice and such ( it was a Soul Eater one) I had sent that one back, then I had bought another one of these some time later and I don't regret it, the overall feel of the hoodie is nice the design looks great too. I had bought an XL and fits me just right but I would always buy a size or 2 larger then what you currently wear, other then those 2 things it was great."
4.0,"Light material, airy. Love the color! Perfect summer dress for the beach or boardwalk. Runs a bit large."
4.0,"Men....beware. When you pop these bad boys on those babes at the pool will see parts of your thigh that have never seen the light of day. This could either be good or bad depending on how often you skipped leg day. Regardless, these babies are short and you will either love them or hate them for it. My advice is to embrace it. Bring out your inner Magnum P.I. and rock these trunks at your nearest swimming hole.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount for my honest review*"
4.0,This would be a great dress for a choir or stage to wear but up close it was a little bit cheap looking. The fit was great though. My husband said I looked like I belonged to some strict religion.
4.0,"The bottom/skirt is perfect, it fits great and seems like it’s a good quality.  The top was too small so i don’t plan on wearing it.  I plan onpulling the skirt up and wearing it like a strapless dress!"
4.0,Fit nicely - good value for money!
4.0,"But can't give five stars as quality is merely good, not great.  Otherwise, fun gift for clubbing, cosplay, and cetera!"
4.0,I like the jacket. Pretty much as advertised. I was a bit put off by the black skull @ cross bones small patch attached to the lower right front. I don't know the significance as it did not show on the add.
4.0,"This is our second bag. They improved the front closure. The previous bag's magnetic closure tore off from the leather. We are happy with the &#34;new&#34; closure. The bag is functional, looks good and fits a iPhone 6."
4.0,Liked product for price & picture covered well.
4.0,Definitely made for women with longer legs but it was nothing a little hem couldn't fix.
4.0,"These glasses were shipped quickly and well protected!  They are super cute too and they look awesome!  they run on the smaller size,, so just be aware if you have a larger head or not like tight these would not be the glasses for you!  I believe that they are extremely feminine and feel they should not be listed as unisex.<br />I did receive the glasses for a discount in exchange for my honest review!"
4.0,I really like this umbrella. It can be rotated 360 degrees. The only thing about this umbrella that could be improved is the handle aspect. You have to take the hand crank out from one hole (the hole used to open the umbrella) to the bottom hole (to rotate the umbrella 360 degrees) and back again if you want to close the umbrella.
4.0,Very pretty dress but it def runs small so I suggest ordering a size up!!  (It was very tight for me in the chest area with the buttons.)
4.0,Keeps food cold long enough for me.
4.0,Very nice idea :)
4.0,"A little tight under the arms if you have big boobs, but otherwise the dress looks amazing and fits as described. I worse this for a tea party but can see using this for a multitude of events."
4.0,"I really like the nice purple color. This is a nice set for everyday jewelry. I would wear it anywhere formal. I bought two of these. I'm going to keep the purple set, but return the Austrian crystal. It just looks cheap."
4.0,I ordered these big just in case they were too small the material is comfy my daughter loves them!
4.0,Cute but only will fit someone size 8 and under
4.0,"Keeps good time for cheap watch, a bit heavier than I like but wear occasionally."
4.0,"Order UP. I usually wear a M in these dresses...I have several from Gap, Old Navy, etc. I am 5'8 with a curvy figure...34 DD chest and hips. The dress hits me mid calf which I did not want. The top part fits my chest and hugs my hips and butt tightly. The fabric is nice, but also a bit thin. I'm going to keep it for a night gown and order a L to use as a dress. An accurate size chart would be nice to have on the site."
4.0,"Haven’t worn it yet, but fits well and seems it will  be comfortable."
4.0,Perfect and served the purpose. Quick delivery.
4.0,"I'm speaking from limited time wearing these.  They fit well (tho, still breaking in) and seriously dig the zipper in regards to convenience. I'm a mechanic, so not sure how they will hold up under oil? Therefore, so far, so good."
4.0,"Pros:<br />Heavier than I expected - feels like quality<br />The lens color (green/blue mirror) is very vibrant and close to the Ray Ban colored lenses.<br />Comes with a soft cloth case and cleaning cloth<br />Fast Delivery with Amazon Prime<br />Gold metal trim is true to color<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lens quality is low (which is to be expected) - almost gives me a headache when looking through the lenses due to a little bit of blurriness. However, I am very sensitive to such things - ie: motion sickness, nausea, etc.<br /><br />Overall - 4/5 VERY CUTE and STYLISH sunglasses."
4.0,"I purchased these because Walleva has provided for me in the past, with a little regret. The earsocks fit just fine. But the temple shocks don't fit. That may very well be at fault to me, but I've had to trim the plastic for them to even fit; and yet they still fall out."
4.0,"I have had this in my purse since the day it arrived. There was nothing complicated about it. Just attach it. I am always digging through my purse trying to find things. I am never able to find anything. This can be scary when you are looking for your car keys or home keys. Most of the time this light did help. It would go on when you would put your hand in the purse, most of the time. This was helpful. I have no idea how long the light will last or if there is a battery that can be changed. For me, I think my purse has too many things so I need more than one. Lol. I think it could be helpful to many."
4.0,"Me encanta el modelo, el tejido, el color, el estampado solo que los bolsillos quedan un poco grandes pero en conjunto quede satisfecha con mi compra, gracias"
4.0,The band is not as flexible as my original band.  The band did fit my series watch and looks very close to the original band
4.0,I’m a 7/8 and a Small fit me good had to return the Medium’s … Black ones are more of a faded black not a dark black …
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c069bfa90f2ca25392117080f55b3dd]] 4.5 Star rating!<br /><br />Come really quick and faster than expected. Made with a really brocade style material it adds a richness to the look. Although the trip worm and accessories are not leather, they are a nice quality. The brass like buckles and rivets also make a nice touch to this. The JAckiet is separate and can be worn independently of the corset. I also comes with a thong or what we call an &#34;eye patch&#34;.<br /><br />All in all its a good quality for a non-leather corset. So you can get the same look at  a better price. I will update this review wth any issues that may arise with wear in the future.<br /><br />*Please see video review for a more in-depth look. Also please feel free to contact me with any questions.<br />**Coupon purchase for review"
4.0,Gorgeous dress. Super comfortable. Only thing i didnt like was the slip under the dress was so short when I danced it kept coming up. Besides that it was great.
4.0,Fit was good but tight across shoulders when reaching ahead or up.
4.0,"I bought this larger than I needed as I am going through breast reconstruction. I expect to fill out the bra in time. The zip front is what I needed most and it is very convenient for my chemo and reconstruction visits. Just unzip, treat, and go. Convenient."
4.0,These are super cute nylon masks that come with removable filter and ajustable ear loops. Graphics are great and have not faded after several washings. Didn't give a five star only because I don't like the wire on the nose part.
4.0,Clean elegant look. The leather is soft and isn't obnoxious looking if clipped on your belt loop.
4.0,"This broke the same day I received it. I am extremely disappointed as the stones were good quality. However, the elastic did not hold and that was my main concern when purchasing a bracelet like this.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I contacted costumer service regarding the broken bracelet and they sent me a new bracelet replacement! Costumer service was friendly and easy to contact."
4.0,"Beautiful pieces.  Amythest is a bit cloudier than I would have liked, but still very good, expecially for THAT price!"
4.0,"Came in rapidly, is in fine condition.  The watch is light weight and fits well enough.  I asked via Amazon if one could add a link but never got a response.  For the price, I'm quite happy with it.  It is helping convince me to wear a watch.  I would buy one again.  Doing only 4 stars as my question was not answered, otherwise would have given 5."
4.0,Beautiful set of bbeads.i wear mine on my wrist. Long enough to wrap 3 times with slack left over.
4.0,"It is nice (mostly on just the front side).  It was a good buy for the price.  I needed it as a symbol for a craft project, not as jewelry.  It was easy to attach.  It arrived on time.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had been as nice on the back as the front."
4.0,"Texture of material great, color is what is expected overall a great dress, but runs somewhat on the small size.  Would recommend its purchase to others."
4.0,"The gloves are soft and comfortable to wear.  Even though the knuckles are hard, they do not rub on your hand through the glove.  The finger holes were a little larger than I would have liked, but the thumb hole was much too loose.  The wrist comes with an adjustable Velcro strap, but pulled at it's tightest, there was a wrinkle in the fabric of the back of the glove.  The material itself is thin and breathable.  You get what you pay for with these, they aren't the highest quality, but they aren't falling apart either and they are affordable.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Love the look.. Let's see if it wont fade asthe description states...
4.0,The price was the best. The fit and color were nice too.
4.0,Está bonito y queda perfecto
4.0,These pants are very comfortable and very cute BUT they are different from the photo. The buttons in the photo are black and the buttons that came on the pants are brown. I hate brown buttons and probably wouldn’t have bought them if they had brown buttons BUT they are so comfortable and cool I’m glad I bought them.
4.0,"I don’t ski, but I like padded ski socks for working outside in the winter, and also just wearing about the house. Long, thick socks keep my feet warmer.<br /><br />The Forcool Women’s Padded Skiing Socks are made in China, from 40% merino wool, 40% acrylic, 12% nylon, and 8% elastane. That’s according to the label on the bag.<br /><br />I wanted to see if the socks would shrink, so I washed and dried one to compare it to the other … and wow did the washed sock shrink! The washed sock shrank by several inches. But when I put both socks on, they felt the same on my feet. I couldn’t really tell a difference between them.<br /><br />The sizing seems pretty accurate. I tried a size medium, which is men’s 4-6 and women’s 5-7.5. I actually wear a 7.5 in men’s and the medium in the Forcool socks fit me.<br /><br />The socks have light padding in the shin, heel, and toes.<br /><br />The socks come up to my knees and actually stay up there. I tried wearing them for a few hours and didn’t have to tug the socks up once."
4.0,Very nice with several sections to organize!
4.0,"Looks great, but overpriced for what it is (I paid ~$60). Would have bought it for cheaper but I appreciate the design and couldn't find a competitor product that looked similar enough."
4.0,but fine
4.0,Nice looking hat just a little small looks almost like a child’s hat
4.0,Nice quality and fast delivery
4.0,"Choose a smaller size, I think it is larger than my expectation."
4.0,Beautiful! Took off one star because they are a little light weight. Would have liked them to feel a bit more substantial.
4.0,"I love this dress!  Very cute.  I gave it only 4 stars because it doesn't fit loose like the pic.  However, it is super cute!"
4.0,"This is a great bang for the buck.  I have some high end watches and of course this does not compare but at this price point its an amazing deal.  First off, the watch looks great but throw the bracelet it comes with in the trash.  You are better off putting it on something you like.  I have it on a Eulit Panama 20mm.<br /><br />I put the watch on my timegrapher and the movement is as expected.. not great but not horrible either.  It is about +26s/day but the amplitude and the error rate are very acceptable.  The movement in the watch that I received was running well, with no signs of issue.  This watch is a keeper.<br /><br />The case is chunky but not to the point of looking awkward on the wrist.  My wrist in the shot is 7.25.  I think the bracelet it came with could fit the wrist of a gorilla but again, its probably already been hauled off with the rest of the trash so I have no experience with it."
4.0,These googles are a good tight fit and anti fog.
4.0,I ordered this dress because it looked easy to use for breastfeeding and it was cute. I ordered the color Brick Red. My only complaint is that it looks orange not a brick red color. The length is great and it looks like the pictures except the color. Other than that I like this dress.
4.0,Bought before and xlarge was a little big and fit perfect after washing. These are a little tight before washing
4.0,So far I like it. It's a good size and it seems pretty good quality for the money.
4.0,Hurt when worn for more then two hours. I have had it for almost a year now and I only wear it on special occasions. Very pretty and big enough to see through my thick hair.
4.0,It fit perfectly and its very nice looking! The material is nice but it is very sensitive and I'm clumsy so it did rip very easily when I pulled on it. The stitches on the side were what ripped but other than that it was a great product.
4.0,It's a tad tight around the middle but that's where i carry my weight.  Zipper kind of a pain to get zipped.  Might exchange for a medium. Overall I nice dress.  5'5 140 38c
4.0,"Fits top perfect.  Good length  considering I'm short, however seemed to have excessive amount of material from waist down...had altered after I was asked if pregnant as plenty of room to hide this. Colors wash & remain vibrant, material soft & doesn't bother my skin ."
4.0,"I use these when traveling by air, and would recommend them."
4.0,"Disclaimer: I received the item for a reduce cost in order to try and give it a review.<br /><br />It's a nice wallet, it's pretty big and it has lots of compartments, i.e credit cards slots. I would have liked it to be a little sleeker. Because it's  big. This a wallet can be used as a mini clutch. This is perfect for someone with a big bag because it won't get lost in their clutter."
4.0,"Great for a little girl who doesn't have her ears pierced, or who is allergic to earrings (like mine). My daughter loves being able to have &#34;earrings&#34; and changes them daily. She's 6 and notices how many of her friends have pierced ears and even though she knows she is allergic, she still wants to be like them."
4.0,"Super cute and I love the fit,  they just scratch really easily."
4.0,"I am 5'4, i weigh around 135 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fita me pretty loose, the shirt goes down to mid thigh for me. I will probably make it into a crop top though. If you're pretty skinny and around my height and weight then i recommend to get a small for a perfect fit. For me I'm just going to make it a crop top. However i love it anyways. I could also use it to sleep."
4.0,"so cute, great color, size, length.  the chain did break near the clasp after about a month, but was fixed pretty easily.  otherwise I love it!"
4.0,Fits perfect for me
4.0,It's a great sweater....it's not too heavy or light and the sleeves are more 3/4 than full so it's perfect for someone like me who is barely 5ft.
4.0,"Wear it regularly. I like it,"
4.0,Muy lindas pero me quedaron pequeñas. Se tienen que pedir un número más.
4.0,"Nice shade, material is thin not thick."
4.0,too shapeless for me
4.0,Cute socks and thinner. Cheap and afforadable
4.0,These earrings are very intricate and beautiful! The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because with the opals it was almost too much for me (I prefer simply elegant over more bling). They are just as lovely after the opals are taken out and more my style. If you like jewelry with more pizzazz then these are perfect for you. :)
4.0,I really like this watch. I would give it 5 stars but the strap is a little short. But I knew that going in 'cause I read the reviews. It is so nice to be able to freedive and never have worry about the watch getting water in it. It is also extremely durable as far as shock goes.
4.0,"3 zippered pockets I would use are left/right and one in the upper waist band on back which is very nice for cell phone area - my Moto X4 stretch fit into it fine. The material feels nice and I like the ability to adjust the legs to either open or tight - open doesn't look good but feels good on the leg. The waist and material stretches and waist also has a string tie if too tight. I'm slightly bigger than what it says the XL size should be but it fit me ok. I don't like the aesthetics (view) of the short leg style - ie. cross between pants and shorts, but if you like that style then these are good pants/shorts."
4.0,"I received this outfit in a large. It was somewhat tighter than I thought, but is ok to wear. It is very thin and light weight and long. I like it!"
4.0,The bars it came with were way too thick but the bars I wear were too short. Took pliers to them to make the holes close enough for my regular bars. Really cute and fun to wear for a few hours.
4.0,"Exactly type and size I needed. Very hard to find in local stores!  One issue... even though the description says assorted colors, all I receive is solid white.  Would like a little color!"
4.0,"The packaging was pretty and so is the necklace. It is a very pretty, deep blue color. I am very excited to wear it with tonight’s outfit. My only concern is with the quality of the chain. I will be really putting it to the ultimate test while wearing it over the next week to see how sturdy the chain is made. I will be back to update if there are any issues with the quality. Other than that, the look of it is beautiful especially for the price. I would buy again."
4.0,Got it for my 6 year old - she loves it!
4.0,"The product works as advertised. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that I had a very difficult time getting the backing off the tape that holds the foam to the inside of the hat."
4.0,"It was nice! I received a lot of compliments. The quality wasn't too great, the seam was loose in the shoulder area."
4.0,The left pocket was smaller than the right. Other than that the dress fit fine I wore to church with heels and to a graduation party with flats.
4.0,"I like it because is like several bracelets in one, simple, cute, and young; great for your teenage niece or daughter."
4.0,"I purchased this dress to wear to an outdoor event, but it was to cold to wear the dress, but it is a basic summer dress"
4.0,Cute style for all ages. It is easy to slip on. I pretied the back twice before I got it where I wanted it. Washed it on delicate with Woolite.  I hung it on a hanger to dry.
4.0,Have been through 4 airport securities now. No one detected the belt. Quality could be better though.
4.0,Amazingly constructed. Resolved discomfort in shoe length and width
4.0,Simple watch needed to complete business casual attire.. looked great
4.0,Good quality and the price very reasonable
4.0,Runs small even for Xlarge. Cute though.
4.0,Good. Like them
4.0,I initially purchased this belt for ONE dress but after wearing it and liking it I have decided it goes with a lot of outfits.  This belt looks very cute on and it is decent quality. I wear it a lot!
4.0,Wish the wrist band was longer.  If my son was chubby this would not fit his wrist. Very small but great to us to learn to tell time!
4.0,"Good looking shirt. Construction is good, material is on the thicker side. Fit is somewhere in-between slim and standard fit. Length is shorter than a standard shirt. If you are 5'5"" to 5'8"" the shirt lenth should be spot on. Any taller than it's going to seem short. If you are on the fence size up one. Also the arms area little on the puffy side."
4.0,Very warm.  Thicker than expected
4.0,"This shirt is made from a nice soft material and feels well crafted. Overall, would look good in the right size.<br /><br />My sizing typically runs between XL and XXL, with XXL often being a bit on the roomy side. I ordered this shirt in XXL and have to say it fits just like my XL shirts (before even washing). In fact, it was so much like my XL shirts I had to double-check the size tag when I took it off. I would definitely recommend ordering one size up, particularly if you tend to wear one of the larger sizes."
4.0,"The rain jacket is what I expected. It has a comfortable, roomy fit and it is waterproof and perfect for travel. The only negative is that the pouch zipper was broken when it arrived."
4.0,Watch I bought for my mother I thought would be easy for her and it was but her wrist is so small and the watch doesn’t stay put.
4.0,"got for the X something nice and yeah, it fits S described and is like silk. She lived it just as much as the next guy who I think had no complaints either. Lol"
4.0,"I ordered a size up per some of the reviews, but it was too large.  For reference, I usually wear an 18/20, and am more pear shaped—the 20 was too big. I will be trying a smaller size though!"
4.0,"I really like these pants they're super comfy. My only problem if that two of the belt loops ripped after a day, and the button kept coming off till I eventually list it about a month ago."
4.0,"compare to the typical jean legging (even those with pockets), these look really close to actual skinny jeans with belt loops.  They look less like leggings, has a good solid blue wash and feels very steady. good stretch. not see through. the back pockets are steady too, can hold my smartphone just fine, but I hate the pocket placement, needs to be a bit higher, because they almost make it seem low rise, but yet the legging is high waist. will consider getting the black pair too soon. Love the length of these leggings, because some legging fit just to the ankles. Btw, I'm a guy, 5'8 that wears women's jeans and the occasional legging, because of my smaller waist, sometimes because the way leggings might look on a guy, i don't always wear them out, but these are perfect actually. A smooth transition to a legging that can fool people you're wearing jeans with back pockets."
4.0,I really like these Aviator style sunglasses. I got them for myself but I'll probably give them as a gift to a male member of my family on their birthday. They're a little big on me. But otherwise they're definitely worth the money.
4.0,"Cheap feeling, but for the price its ok."
4.0,They’re cute but they’re superrrr big.
4.0,Good value and quality. Just wish they were a little larger
4.0,"This was a nice shirt not too in your face like some ,haven’t washed it yet but looks like it won’t be a Shrinker so will probably have to hang to dry."
4.0,"The sizing is way large, go down two sizes.  Other than the size, my husband and I absolutely love these robes.  Soooo soft and warm.  It has a hood and goes all the way down to feet."
4.0,Cute top but one sleeve is smaller than the other. Probably ask for exchange. Color is very bright pink
4.0,Like the shirt. I bought an extra large and it fit just a shade snug. Great material.
4.0,"Worked for the concert I needed it for! The chain is VERY long (came to mid thigh, i'm 5'4"") & I was able to remove it easily and use a shorter one from a different purse. Fit way more than expected"
4.0,"Wish it had a front pouch pocket, but they are very comfortable and lightweight,  perfect for a chilly morning"
4.0,"The dress fits well to the body, the material feels very comfortable and the color is perfect."
4.0,Very sturdy set of braces. I like the stylish stripes and the nicely finished hardware.
4.0,I liked it but too small.. returned it - asked for a new order - correct size.... Haven't heard about reorder
4.0,"Fabric is pretty thin and quality is on-par with a Halloween costume - I wouldn't call this high quality, but it's good enough for Halloween. Size is as expected (I'm 5'6"", 115 lbs; ordered the Small and it fits exactly how it should). Sleeves are quite wide, but fabric is not stretchy, so that's the only way to lift your arms!"
4.0,Size  was an issue but a nice product
4.0,Bought these in preparation for a trip to Costa Rica.  I did a &#34;practice run&#34;  and will be ordering more.  They have changed the way I pack!  LOVE THEM.
4.0,"Chain broke within 1 day of wearing, but the pendant is amazing."
4.0,"The leaf design (or whatever you want to call it) is rather wide if you have skinny fingers (like me).<br />The ring was a bit bent when I got it (probably just a little damaged on the way to my house) in the bottom, it's a bit flat.<br /> It really is a nice ring, I just have too small of fingers. I can still wear it, and it looks great! It's just not a ring I would wear if I was doing a lot with my hands that day."
4.0,Very cute and comfy but seems like zipper should come down a little more. Other then that I love it
4.0,"Problem with this hat is that it stains, and fades when you sweat. If you wash it, it gets worse. Fit and construction are fine, just need to use a fade resistant fabric."
4.0,"So cute and you can smell the oils all day, the bracelets band however is very thin and it seems already after a couple of wears that it's not going to last very long so I'm kinda disappointed about that but maybe it will surprise me! Essential oil bracelets are my new obsession lol!!!"
4.0,"Thought these would be little bigger and bolder but not so lucky. Either way, they are well made with a beautiful finish on all four pair, and you can't beat the value. I turned them info gifts."
4.0,"So far so good. The belt is exactly what i need.  I am in between reg belt sized and this belt has allowed me to get a good fit.<br />I have had an issue with the release, which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I hoping it was user error."
4.0,I like them. The diamonds are a little big but not to much. They fit good in my lip.<br />I will buy more from this seller.<br />Thank you!!!!!!! :)
4.0,These shirts feel great and have enough room in the waist. silky smooth and would be great for summer hiking. my only issue is they do not have a label so  it is not easy to find the front of the shirt.
4.0,"I'm giving 4 stars because the skirt is very much true to the picture! It is not puffy like in the photo, I took mine to the cleaners to press it my zipper was cheap I had my cleaners replace the zipper other then that ... If you are a size 10 in American or below this is perfect I got the xL and I'm. 14 it fit but snug !!"
4.0,Let a bit to big for my face I have a small face but the quality is good
4.0,This is a really cute bag. The only problem with it is it's way too small. I couldn't get my phone nor my wallet in it
4.0,We loved the ear pieces. It was very helpful with my 4 year old who just started wearing glasses. The straps not so much. They snag your hair.
4.0,had them for about two weeks fit in glasses good and don't heart your eyes love the polarization and they don't get scratched easily.
4.0,"The photo made it seem more like it has a silver finish, but I would have to say it is more like a chrome finish. That said, for the price I think it is very cute."
4.0,Cute but returned it because it ran really small.
4.0,Fits good and helps keep me cool.
4.0,ordered a one and received a two. Fortunately for me they run small because the two did fit. Made one little birthday girl very happy.
4.0,Nice thick material. There is elastic in the shoulders so the fabric gathers if your shoulders aren’t wide enough to stretch it all the way. I ordered a small and have to have it taken in so maybe buy a size smaller ?
4.0,It is lightweight. But I purchased a small and wish I had gotten a medium. I am 5 feet 2 and weigh 115 lbs. and thought a small would fit good. Nope. I can just get it around with an inch or two to spare. Keep that in mind when ordering.
4.0,Very nice. A little smaller than I envisioned.
4.0,"I have been using this product for a few years now.  As a regular hiker, I know where my hot spots are going to be before I even go on a hike so I apply them before I go.  Those little white foam pads are a lifesaver!  I put them on my hot spots and NEVER get blisters.  Looking at the price, you think that they are pricey for those little pads, but when you are hiking Half Dome and get up and down without any blisters you will think they are worth every penny!  Last year we went hiking with a friend who got blisters and used the wet pad with cover and they also worked.  For the angry review that I saw, I am going to assume that they did not apply them correctly.  The only thing that I don't like is that there are not enough of the white foam pads in the box which is what we use the most of. I keep checking to see if they will start selling a kit with just the pads.  We end up giving away our extra on the trail to folks that are not prepared."
4.0,"Love the dress, but the belt is a little too small... I like using a satin Rubin as a belt more, so not a big deal."
4.0,Love them! Look great! Only problem I had was putting them on because of the curved metal. Had to fish it through my ear lol.
4.0,Fit great.  Design was a little off centered.
4.0,Good quality stretched out a little. Lasted about 4 months
4.0,So far I am very happy with the bags. I only used the bag one time. I do not know about durability. I would like to see solid colors as an  option.
4.0,"Girlfriend loves these, very sexy, but do not wear them to a wedding with 3-7 flights of stairs. Talk about ouch. They are great for a date night though. She got lots of compliments and hit on alot wearing these.<br /><br />Update by girlfriend:<br />I purchased these in 2018 its 2020 and they are still one of my favorite heels. I wore them for 2 weddings,  1 rehearsal dinner, and 3 parties(one was Halloween) they are easy to clean and look crazy sexy. I always get compliments and or hit on when I have these on. Granted I'm always ""stunting"" if these are on in the first place. I definitely recommend, be sure not to tie them too tight."
4.0,This is a single bracelet with two colors.  Its is exactly what I was looking for to help with my golf game balance.  The colors are nice. Thank you
4.0,Very cute for the $$
4.0,Good for kids or simple cosplay.
4.0,Good bag!
4.0,I like it because I don't need a bra under it.
4.0,Not as good as pic<br />It will do
4.0,I wore this to a 1930s Halloween party. Pieces are kind of flimsy but they did the trick and were not expensive.
4.0,"Nothing to complain about.  I like the case they came in, not a fan of the ""sock"" and got rid of that immediately.  I like the way they fit and can't really complain.  Usually, I buy cheap sunglasses after trying on dozens of pairs.  Considering that I couldn't try them on first, I'm quite happy with the fit and feel of them."
4.0,very cushiony
4.0,"I would love to have given these socks the full 5 stars but only one issue prevented that...the texture did not feel good on the bottom of my feet. It was almost like standing on gravel instead of being soft. Maybe after a few washings they will soften up. Otherwise, the color, quality, and fit are perfect. Maybe if they change the way they're manufactured and make the foot pad part without any texture, they'll feel good right off the bat."
4.0,"I was hesitant to order this. I'm a dog groomer and was questioning the water and hair resistance. Overall I'm happy with it. It's super cute, doesn't hold smell. Doesn't completely keep you dry. But for the price it was very nice"
4.0,"Love the wallet, my only complaint is the middle flip id holder sags a little."
4.0,"Bought this as a gift, recipient claimed to like it alot."
4.0,It's good for mask
4.0,Sturdy and well made case for TruVision glasses.
4.0,"I really adore this shirt. It falls a bit lower than I'd expected, so I wear it with leggings more than jeans but it is ultra comfortable and very flattering. This is a great every day shirt"
4.0,"Packaged nicely.  Constructions appears to be good.  No tumble dry recommended, which has left packaging wrinkles in the shirts after several washings.  I'm more concerned about this than husband is."
4.0,They look great .. the size and the fit were on point
4.0,"Update- great customer service- they resolved the issue.  Replacement umbrella is working well!  Great customer service.<br />This umbrella won’t open all the way on its own and is very hard to close.  By the time I get it closed to get in the car, I’m soaking wet.  What’s the point?"
4.0,A med would have been better but based on the chart I chose lge. I'm sure it will shrink Skittle after washing. Used under my hawiian costume.
4.0,It was nice....
4.0,"It’s sturdy and flexible, and petite. Works well With Apple Watch."
4.0,Bought this for my grandson - 3 years old. Was perfect for him at this price point. Wish the cape was a little more adjustable as the neck is a little large for him - but he loved it!!
4.0,Daughter said it was a little big but it actually fit her prefect. Not too tight or big. Pretty color. I hope the material will last. Just got it so i don't know much about the quality of it yet.
4.0,"I like this dress a lot and I get compliments on it almost every time I wear it. Out of the 3 Zattcas's dresses I own, it is my favorite.  I'm 5'5&#34; and had to have the bottom taken up (My seamstress charges $15 for dresses/ $8 for jeans if that gives you a price range- She also took off the belt for me at no additional cost.) My only complaint is that the back and front of the dress do not line up in the pattern.  -The picture below is to show you the line of where the front and back panels come together on the side and how they do not line up at all. - The picture is poor as it was shoved in my closet and I just left it on the hanger to snap the picture.<br /><br />I wear it often with this navy shrug at work to keep my shoulders covered and it matches perfectly. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U9ZPZV0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
4.0,"The double Pearl Braclet is very classy looking, especially with a little black dress!  It is just the right accent piece.  It is a little bit difficult to get on, but goes right back in place after a little twist."
4.0,I love the dress it’s comfy and cute. However the black has faded a little bit after only a couple washes. :/
4.0,"Very pretty, bright colors. Colors wear off and discolor over time but solid concerning protection."
4.0,Super cute and comfortable. Very soft and cozy. I'll be ordering more in different colors for this fall & winter.
4.0,Well made and cute dress for my 15 year old for school functions.
4.0,These fit great and have been a really nice entry into compression socks for running.
4.0,"I love this shirt, fits well. And despite other reviews, I think this is long enough to wear with leggings, it wasn't short as I was expecting (because of other reviews).  I can't give this 5 stars because this shirt is pink, not red.  The packing slip said red, but this is not red."
4.0,Love this suit. The only issue I have is that there is virtually no support in the chest area so if you have a larger chest it doesn’t help lift at all.
4.0,Looks smashing with the thin garb plaid cardigan
4.0,"It is just as pictured and is adorable. If you have a lot of credit cards and carry a lot of receipts and change in your wallet, which actually describes me, it will not clasp.  However, because it is so lovely, I actually shedded a few cards I always carried around and really don't need anyway and it clasps just fine. Definitley encourages minimalism :)"
4.0,I love these sun glasses.  They are easy to fasten tightly onto my glasses.
4.0,"This is a very cute belt. I was worried it might not fit when it arrived but the size is good for me (I might have been able to size down one size even but this one will work). The only complaint I have is the way it buckles. There's not a belt buckle, so to speak, but a rivet type thing that just pushes through the holes. I'm not a fan of that very much but since I won't be wearing this daily, I can 'deal with it'. It's difficult to pull out of the holes however, and I'm worried it will end up breaking. Fortunately, it's not an expensive belt and it's going to look very cute with the outfit I bought it for."
4.0,These help reduce noise but not completely block it out. The way the fold up is kind of tricky to unfold them to put them on your head ( at least for my kid. )
4.0,I liked the colors and the fit. The high waist help give support and material was comfortable and not thin.<br />I ordered medium 5’9” 150 lbs and fit nicely.
4.0,"These are lovely, well made earrings but larger than expected and so I am going to turn them into posts that will look vintagey and be more flattering.  Don't know why I can't find red earrings that are about 8 - 10 mm (except for round balls.)  They are all either tiny or huge!"
4.0,"Nice colored band. Using now. So far, so good. Did get some grease on it that I was able to wipe off with no stain. Wear in most of the time to track my sleep and daily activities. Only two months old now, so don't know about longevity. I did break my original band with in one month of having it. Not real sturdy connections points. If you happen to catch it just right, it's gonna break. Not real likely, just I'm able to do weird stuff."
4.0,This is a cool dress! I wear a size 11/12 and I bought a large and it was huge on me. I am 5’1 and this dress went way past my knees. Definitely size down as this has a little stretch to it too.
4.0,"It’s a really cute top but it fits snugger than expected. It’s not so tight I can’t or won’t wear it, but I prefer my tank tops just a little big. It’s made of soft, stretchy material, perfect for yoga or other exercises, which I think that’s what it’s made for lol i ordered the XL but I normally wear a L, or sometimes a Medium, but mainly a Large due to my chest size. It’s not too tight around my chest or belly pouch that I acquired after having 2 children. I would definitely order at least 1 size up or 2 if you don’t want a form fitting shirt."
4.0,The skirt fit really well. It was a different material than I expected but still nice.
4.0,"Does run a little on the small side, hopefully some shapewear will help fix that though.  Love the grommet details, love the hi-lo length, especially since I'm 5'2""  Makes me feel very sexy and mysterious. Lol.  The hood is an extra plus too."
4.0,"I went up a size because of other reviews. I ordered and XL, but did find they needed to be returned for a large. They fit baggy on me, not super tight as pictured. Quality is great and they are super cute and what I have been searching for."
4.0,"Love the size, easy to grasp, needed something durable that we can take outside or let kids use with no worries about breaking. They tip over a little easy, so that is the only negative."
4.0,"If you like cotton product, you'll defiantly love these. They are breathable and comfortable, but will stretch out after a few washes."
4.0,"It's a great quality jacket and looks exactly as it does in the picture. It was a bit smaller than expected on me, but I take the blame on that aspect for not following the &#34;always get one size larger than normal&#34; rule. The coat is not made of any stretch fabric, so make sure you check the sizing chart and stuff before hand. Or, get a size larger than what you normally wear. Other than that, this product was really good and i'm still pleased with it regardless. It definitely pulled together my 707 cosplay at Tekkoshocon 2018."
4.0,This hold my tummy in very good could be a little longer
4.0,It was delivered alittle after first date but I was compensated quickly and it was received a day and a half after complaint.It fits great just alittle longer than I thought it drags if you don't hold it up when walking but other than that nicely made looks great send pics when I put it on
4.0,"Great belt that complimented my Snow White Disney Bounding outfit PERFECTLY. Just FYI, the goldtone buckle in the front is plastic, not metal. I'm worried it'll crack easily, but I've worn it 3x whole days (8+ hrs) and so far so good. I might not wear this belt ALL the time, but great if I want to finish off an outfit with a pop of color."
4.0,"This watch is very sturdy and has a handsome look to it.  I was surprised of how well it is made. I am a women but like a big face watch so I wear this to work everyday and have received compliments on it seversl.times<br />Of course, if you are a female you will probably have to get it sized like did but it was worth it!"
4.0,Looks great but runs a little small
4.0,"Esperaba otra textura de tela. Es poliester. El blanco es muy transparente y se debe usar refajo o enagua para que no se note. Al ser un corte alto de cintura el refajo hay que subirlo a cada rato pues si no, se nota a mitad de cintura y se ve feo. Quizás en otro color no haya q usar. Pero en general es u  vestido muy versátil. Compré size M"
4.0,Exactly what I wanted except it is smaller than expected! Size up! I bought size 9 month for my 4 month old hoping it would last through winter . Here is the 9 month kimono pictured (right) side by side with a size 3-6 month shirt (left). It fits my 4 month old with a little room to grow. I love the feel and design.
4.0,Great product quick shipping !!!
4.0,My dad loved these. I purchased the same brand and similar pattern from a local retailer and so I knew this was a great find. These pajamas are very comfortable and washes well!
4.0,wish they were a little larger other wise nice earings very dressy or can be just the pop you need when being casual also
4.0,Dwayne Wayne classics for a costume. They did the job.
4.0,"I was surprised at how pretty this swim suit was when I received it. Fit was a bit snug, but I need to have it fixed because one of the straps was sewn on twisted. Otherwise it was good quality material, and very pretty. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,Needed plain neutral tanks and these were perfect!!!
4.0,Great deal and plenty of designs great deal!!
4.0,"I love the color and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  Mine does not taper in at the waist the way it should, it does not adhere to my waist line as it should but still looks great.  Good feel good at work clothing option."
4.0,Beautiful blouse ugly buttons
4.0,"Kind of goofy, work good 450miles of rain"
4.0,"it moves around a bit if its not secured in place but overall it looks  really good, it doesn't look cheap at all."
4.0,"This necklace is very cute and will probably get better with wear, meaning that it is a little bit too shiny for my conservative tastes.  But at this price, it was a great value for the money.  The cross itself is just the right size; very dainty and pretty colors in the stones.  The chain is a little too shiny but will get better with wear.  A lovely pendant for a teenage girl."
4.0,"Beware, runs very small.  Love this little dress. I,m a 36C and it wouldn't zip past the bottom of rib cage.  Zero give in fabric. So Bummed!"
4.0,"Great shirt, color matches description, and love the crochet cut out in the back, but it is too short.  It will work for me because I am short waisted, but there is no &#34;slouch&#34; whatsoever like pictured on the model.  I normally order L in USA sizes, and ordered and XL and it fits.<br /><br />I am a long time Amazon shopper and depend on reviews to help make decisions.  I did get this item at a discount in exchange for leaving a review, but my opinions are genuine."
4.0,love the scully .. been wanting to find something light for the spring summer time because im an avid scully hat wearer lol my only gripe is i wish yall made this in every color because i would definitely buy every single color  of this hat .. please consider that and let me know lol ...
4.0,"These earrings are super cute and I think my eight-year-old will love to get them for Christmas. However, I do have one minor complaint; as shown in the photo, the set arrived with a mismatched pair- three teal stars and only one bee. Otherwise I am pleased with the purchase."
4.0,"Fits great, was true to size, but the fabric looks a bit cheap (which it was inexpensive, so should be expected)<br /><br />Lost one start because it had &#34;wrinkles&#34; when it arrived that were hard to get out."
4.0,"Love the style of the dress, but chose the wrong colour entirely. Re-orded in orange and blue."
4.0,Went to take it out of the plastic package and pulled it straight out and it stuck to the adhesive on the plastic bag lol I was planning to be careful with it but already have to figure out how to get this off of it. Seems nice though!
4.0,Look and feel awesome but damn I must really need to do some work in my calves!
4.0,I use them for headbands when working out. They keep the sweat outa my eyes just fine. The print tends to fade quickly though.
4.0,I like that they are a sturdy thickness and nice elegant look just too skinny for as tall as they are.
4.0,Very pleased with the sweatshirt
4.0,"I bought these pants because I love yoga pants and loved this style...but I took a risk and bought the largest size available ( XL) and they definitely run small and are snug, however they aren't constricting but they show every bump and lump.<br />I do love the style but I guess they are only made for small women..."
4.0,FINE
4.0,Great for the price! The color is maroon looking in the picture but it's more red. Other than that it's great! I'm a bigger girl some was nervous about ordering online but it's great!
4.0,"The brown leather band  is almost too small for me however, this is a good watch for the money. The black leather option was  sized better. I am pleased with my purchase. I wanted I watch that was not too big and this is just the right size."
4.0,Gloves fit perfectly and were beautiful. Cigarette holder came damaged with the silver piece falling off.
4.0,"I used these as a prank on my girlfriend, she complained about getting her the wrong  earings so I pranked her with these for Christmas, had a better set to back these up tho"
4.0,"Ok, a little dull in colors, not as bright as advertised. But the pad is nice and thick so I kept it."
4.0,Love they way they look and how light they are in your ear BUT getting them in is hard I feel like the stem you screw in is not long enough
4.0,Very nice quality.  Barely fit my neck though.  Prob made for someone who is average size. Perfect for my Halloween costume!!
4.0,"Super cute. A little big feeling. I got a small and I am 5'10"", 135 lbs. Just not as tight as I would like. I wish you could see the mesh better."
4.0,A little hard to read. Needs better app. Does not sync with Android. Cannot manage data. Surprisingly accurate pulse. Would be more useful if data was downloadable to website. iPhone app is too basic.
4.0,Internal pockets are not made of high quality!
4.0,Good product and reasonable price
4.0,Not a perfect fit in the crotch but otherwise good.
4.0,"They are cheap, so they are cheap, but they are definitely cute for a costume!  There is no way I would wear these every day though."
4.0,"Very cute,  i have a 32 inch waist and i just barely had to stretch it to clasp. I purchased the xl, If it was any larger,  it would be too big."
4.0,"my bf  has a bigger head than most people. the hat just fit him but it is a little small. however, my dad fits perfectly fine."
4.0,"Nice looking sweater, it arrived with one of the seams open, which I quickly stitched.  Could have been better quality for the price."
4.0,"I had to send this dress pant outfit back because it was too tight on the bust area. Very nice material and fleterring every where else, but smashed my chest down even without a bra."
4.0,They are really nice but too big for my head.
4.0,It's beautiful but it does run a little big.
4.0,normal production
4.0,My mom got me a pair of these and they fit great. Colors are bright and I haven't had any issues yet.
4.0,Seems like a great quality but I would recommend ordering a size larger than normal as the straps make it a little tight to slip on and off easily.
4.0,"Very cute perfect fit it just took too long to get here over a month, I pretty much forgot about it. Very nice though!"
4.0,Fit could be a little better. A bit large but great material and color
4.0,"Pretty dress in the front. The back is plain and the material is very thin cotton (tshirt like) material. It’s worked well and fit well. I would consider this for nicer warmer weather instead of colder weather but the price was excellent, so I have no complaints."
4.0,"Cute mask. I purchased the rhinestone one but it is more iridescent. As with most fashion masks, it doesn’t stay over your nose if you’re talking. Not super protective, just a basic fabric mask with a cute design."
4.0,"Nice looking glasses, fit well. The reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 star is because they feel a little flimsy, but the price and look is not bad at all. I like them."
4.0,90%
4.0,The sweatshirt came on time which was awesome compaired to another 3d sweatshirt I ordered that I’m still being shipped from a different seller. The colors are super vibrant and my nephew and niece just stare at the illustrations and point out the characters. And I brought it oversized which is great. I wish it was normal sweatshirt material though and one of the strings in the hoodie was a bit frayed but other than that I love it.
4.0,Work well for what i need
4.0,"I personally love then they are super breathable, comfortable, and keep me warm"
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected, but great craftsmanship and it's just as cute as it is in the picture!"
4.0,strange place for a label you need to remove..hopefully it comes of without issue.
4.0,I wore this on a cruise in Spain. It was nice. Received alot of compliments.
4.0,"It's not the most flattering but very comfortable, nice fabric, great for household wear or for a swimsuit coverup.  I wouldn't go out to dinner in it but that's not what I got it for.  I ordered a large and it is roomy enough, I normally wear a 10-12 size."
4.0,"I gave it four stars because this bracelet is made for a man and not a woman, because it’s too big. The bracelets are cute and nicely made though. Oh and the necklace is nicely made also. As far as the bracelets I’ll size them for my wrist later on."
4.0,"Size was good... I ordered an XL hoping it would fit like an actual XL and not be too tight and I wasn't disappointed! The arm holes are low, but that's fine, I just wore another tank under it. It fits like a loose workout style tank. Loved it for the 4th!"
4.0,Very comfortable. Very happy.
4.0,My wife looks awesome in these.
4.0,"A bit saggy on my legs, not sure they will stay up above my boots but they're really cute and could wear them with shoes too. I think I will be pulling them up more than I was hoping but oh well, they are cute and warm and I still enjoy them."
4.0,"This is a very cute top!  I love the straps are tie able, so you can adjust them to your liking.  They completely cover my bra strap, so you get that sexy look while still having support.  One small Hangup was  that it slightly puckers by the arm hole.  It is not a deal breaker for me tho.  The material is light, airy and comfortable.  The stomach area is stretchy and very forgiving to any problem areas.  I think this is a really flattering cut and am so pleased with it.  I’d def recommend this top.  Fits true to size."
4.0,Top quality and attractive style but rather heavy. I replaced it with a lighter weight purse.
4.0,Nice container.  A little bulkier  than I was hoping for . It has eliminated my accidentally activating my remote starter .
4.0,"SO CUTE! A little pinching on my nose, but worth it!"
4.0,Gag Christmas gift. I want to buy one for myself!
4.0,"Very thin, so it will fit under my equestrian helmet,,but doesn't cut the wind quite as much as I hoped."
4.0,"Nice leather jacket, not the highest quality  leather but defiantly worth $150.00. I feel it's true to size (I ordered a small) I can wear a light weight sweater with it comfortably. Overall I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it at this price."
4.0,"I really like this watch fob.  I was surprised that it had a nice weight to it (not flimsy or light). The only thing that worries me is that apparently you cannot replace the battery in it. Makes me a little unsure about how long it will last.  But for now, works great and is very attractive."
4.0,I had many compliments❤️ Very comfortable ❤️
4.0,"Fit as expected (5'5"" 130# size M) and not overly revealing, which was a plus. One word of warning, I bought this in hot pink and it is pretty see-through so a pair of pasties is definitely necessary!"
4.0,Very simple. Great color and nice fit.
4.0,"Love it, but a little large face for my taste. Otherwise, it's as advertised!"
4.0,This is very soft and looks nice. My only complaint is that it feels like one size too small for me. For anyone who is on the larger size(not just fat like me but has large muscular thighs) I recommend buying one size larger that what you normally buy.
4.0,I really enjoy the fit of this shorts. It's also fells very light. I have to get used to actually wearing when wet as it is more compersome than a regular bikini bottom.
4.0,"This is a nice set....I give it 4 stars because of the color. The gold is very bright, it reminds me of those tri-gold jewelry sets. I used a clear enamel on it to tune it down a bit. I sure if I had let it sit out a while that would have done the same thing. The necklace and the bracelet fit, with space remaining to adjust. My ring size is 11 and I gently pulled it until it fits comfortably. I really like this set and will wear it a lot."
4.0,The dress fits very nicely and the colors are vibrant and pretty.  The length is just right.  I purchase another in another print.
4.0,My son loves it but the Material is thin and the front of the shirt is partially see thru
4.0,"Nice true to size for me. I got the black glitter, silver, light rose gold, green glitter/ turquoise glitter, purple glitter, and purple. The green glitter/ turquoise is actually clear with green glitter. I was really wanting the one in the picture since it looked really pretty. The glitter is coming off in the first 5 minutes there is glitter on my skin. The design isnt as dominant either. I took away a star for those things color not being right and glitter coming off. Other than that they are a nice alternative to wearing your real rings. I included picture of what I ordered and what I received side by side to show difference."
4.0,"The 10.5 that I ordered is my size shoe.  The right one fit perfectly even with my orthotic in it.  The left one was just a bit snug on the left side with my orthotic in it.  However, i adjusted( cut )  the orthotic a bit and they fit great!  These sneakers are very light, which I like,  they are comfortable and they look good.  The forefoot  of the shoe is a little bit wide, but i got used to it quickly!"
4.0,Such a nice fit and super comfortable
4.0,"Extremely thin- but decent, just added some spank under the dress... I'm a little too curvy not too. Sizing as expected on chart"
4.0,"I love this dress. At first touch out of the package I could tell it was going to be nice. A slightly heavy-weight material but not too heavy to make it uncomfortable in the sun. I purchased the 2X-L and it fits well. I stand 5'8"", 200lbs., hourglass but more heavy in the chest than the derriere. The dress has a nice cut in at the waist to give it shape and there is wonderful swing. High neckline like in the picture but not suffocating. I am about to order more. Summer just got fun as I was getting bored of shorts."
4.0,Very pretty earrings for the price.
4.0,Good tough socks
4.0,"Great bag! Roomy, fashionable, well made. Very happy with my purchase."
4.0,I bought this for my sister because she always is wearing a hair tie on her wrist. It drives me crazy when I see that so I bought her this with the hope that it would look better and that she would like it. I have to say it worked out perfectly she loves the way it looks and has gotten a lot of complements on it. She hasn't had any issues with her hair ties not fitting on or not. She likes it because she never has to worry about stretching out a new hair tie leaving a mark on her wrist. For the price you pay you can not complain it is worth the price. She has sensitive skin and has had no irritations or anything. She hasn't taken it off since she got it and I hasn't even turned green or anything. For the price you are paying you can't complain and it lives up to everything I want it too.
4.0,"Looks great and the fit is awesome. There is one draw back the doesn't seem like a big deal but it's becoming an issue. The length of the chin strap is small. Takes a couple seconds longer to strap. That wouldn't be an issue except now it's rubbing on my chin and making a rash. The padding on the retention strap to prevent that is really thin and doesn't stay in place. Don't know if it'll become a big enough problem for a return, will try it for a couple more days."
4.0,These do ease lights during night driving.  Very happy with this purchase.
4.0,Order up a lot in size. They run very small. Luckily we read the reviews and were able to go by measurements. Super cute tho.
4.0,"I like how well made it is but, It's smaller than what I expected"
4.0,This item was pretty basic but the wording on the card is beautiful and makes the necklace even more appealing. The craftsmanship is very nicely made sturdy and does not look cheap. This will be a nice gift for a friend that is very special to you in my case this would be a coworker that will be leaving my department.
4.0,"Fits perfectly everywhere except the actual bra part. It is not meant for someone with a bra size bigger than a B. I either almost shows your nipples or you get underboob. You could get a size bigger, but then the criss cross part will be too big."
4.0,It is larger than I expected but seems well made.
4.0,"I like that it has a sort-of pinstripe look. It's a little snugger than I anticipated (considering similar items I've purchased), but I like it."
4.0,I was expecting black and white but it looks blue
4.0,I really like the bag. It seems sturdy. Pricey for a non designer bag
4.0,"This necklace is pretty and I was drawn to it because of the shape and colors of the stones.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is larger than I thought it would be, so that is probably my mistake for not checking it out a little better than I did before purchase.  As this was purchased as a gift, it turned out the recipient was thrilled with it.  This is a love it or not type of item."
4.0,"Love This top! The fabric is smooth and silky. The off the shoulder sleeves fit well and is stylish. The only con is the elastic around the chest is a bit tight. I have a small frame and found it bearable but a bit tight. For ladies with a larger frame you may find it uncomfortable. Regardless, I will buy another one."
4.0,"Theyre pretty wide my babys foot is rather slim, the fabric is like faux leather almost very cute though i do love them"
4.0,"So being familiar with this material I know it tears and comes undone easily, but there were a few holes in the sewing on arrival, I did just fold them over and re sew them, I got two pairs the other pants were great, no holes no tears. Wear them all the time, favorite pants. Everyone compliments them, and I love that an inner material was sewn in so they arent see-thru I 100% respect that! As these pants are typically too see-thru to wear out, I can wear these anywhere with confidence nobody will see the shape of me, or see me thru them"
4.0,My kiddo thought they were really comfortable.
4.0,Made very well and great fit
4.0,"Fit a little big for my kid, I recommend going by measurements and not by age. It was soft and warm fabric."
4.0,These belts are great. I would recomend.
4.0,These pieces came on time and were exactly as expected.  Very pleased with the product for the price.
4.0,The metal stud is a little big but you'll get use to it
4.0,"Cute dress. It's a little snug on the torso, but fits well otherwise."
4.0,"Unique build, not super bulky, perfect for traveling, &amp; good price!"
4.0,"We ordered this ring in red, and either the red is more orange, or we got orange. Other than that the ring is nice, and very comfortable, but runs a little larger than expected, which is somewhat annoying because we were hoping to use these as wedding ring alternatives for things less suitable for our everyday rings. Still, after a few months of on and off usage they're in good shape with no noticeable scratches or other damage."
4.0,"Sleeves a little too long but other than that, I'm happy."
4.0,"fits well, very cool and comfortable.  great as a swim cover-up."
4.0,"For 16 pairs of plugs, this is a great deal. My other 00g plugs and tunnels look bigger, but these are true to size. I do like jewelry that make my ears look a little bigger than 00g (I wear a lot of silicone tunnels) but these are all nice for the price. I did get three pair of black plugs and one black pair with glitter, so it really is just like a grab bag, but the other colors are all nice. If you don’t mind the smaller looking plugs in your ears, these are perfect, but if you like them to look a little larger, I would suggest skipping these. I am happy with my purchase though!"
4.0,They are very cute. I just wish they were bigger. They’re too small.
4.0,Not as soft as Oofos but certainly not too hard - meaning they don’t hurt my feet if I wear them for several hours. Don’t think you can beat them for the price. MUCH better on the feet than regular flat flip flops. I would buy again.
4.0,I love the dress and the color. I usually wear Large but I went a size up considering all the previous reviews saying if you have a large bust to get a size up and yes if you have large bust you definitely have to get a size up. It fits perfectly from the bust and the rest it's a little too loose but it still looks nice. I'll be buying more of other colors.
4.0,"The fit isn’t like a baseball cap, even allowing for the adjustability. The front sits too high for that, but it’s due to the embroided logo.<br /><br />That said, the hat is very good quality. Nice heavy materials, well constructed and good embroidery."
4.0,"These black shorts arrived, seem well-made, fit fine. But the belt that came WITH these shorts? It's an odd BLUE color. A blue belt with black shorts? I suppose that could work, but it looks very odd. I was going to return them, then I looked at the picture - and there it was. Blue belt. So I'll use the belt elsewhere. But hey, maybe my fashion sense is off. Maybe the blue belt would look great. Anyway, I like the shorts themselves."
4.0,its nice but doesnt hold up in the wash
4.0,"Great fit and style! I don’t love the print, but I knew that before I purchased because the picture is accurate. I purchased for my daughter to have a suit that held up to frequent use for her swim team. After several uses, the fabric is already showing wear. I’m not sure if the quality is really better than any other suit I could buy, but the price was really great."
4.0,"I can't believe how beautiful it is for the price! It arrived WEEKS before expected, it was packaged  securely and came in perfect condition. I have a 14k rose gold band that I got from a jeweler and the color  is matched perfectly. A highly recommended buy!"
4.0,"This is a really cute watch.<br />It doesn't look cheap, even though the price pretty much is.<br />My only complaint is that I have small arms so the watchface always ends up sliding around to the inside of my arm.<br />it doesn't stay in place very well, but it looks nice."
4.0,They seem ok. I wear a 3 x for loose but a 2x in other shirts the 3x fits me like a 2 x. Not tight but certainly not loose where it hangs.
4.0,Beautiful charm.  Hope to enjoy wearing it.
4.0,"Love them, but they run a bit small. I wear a medium and ordered a large per customer reviews. Maybe I should've ordered 2 sizes up. They are too snug for my liking."
4.0,Looks great with navy or gray pants.
4.0,They matched my skin better than the pictures made me think they would.  Easy to paint on.  They hold tight to my skin but aren't stifling.  Worked well as fake tattoo sleeves with some bracelets to hide the transition to my hands.
4.0,"It's not the best fingerless gloves, but it's do-able. The gloves do keep your hands warm and it feels great! The only setback from it is that it does snag on some surfaces and tears up a little. Still a nice pair of gloves, nonetheless."
4.0,"Soft, lovely dress. It looks great and I would wear it anywhere"
4.0,I’m 5’2 and I feel like it was good fit. Very comfortable.
4.0,I really love the looks of this swimsuit top. Sometimes the outer layer sticks and doesn’t lay nice on top of the layer below it but it’s still a keeper.
4.0,I should've ordered a bigger size but I like it
4.0,"everything was great except for the length of the pants. they were a bit longer than expected. shouldn't be too surprised tho since the measurements didn't include a length for the pant leg. at any rate, i'm really glad they were a bit longer than a bit shorter because this should be an easy tweak.<br /><br />other than that, everything is great."
4.0,"I like them, though was kind of sad when I clipped them onto my charm and the lanyards kind split apart. So just needs a little reinforcing and great to use."
4.0,I really love them. My only complaint is the inside sole came apart so I had to glue it back down. I wear a 7 so I am not ober stretching them or being rough on them.
4.0,"Nice shirt, very smart.  Unique cut.  Just wish it was a little longer.  At 5’3” it’s just below my waist.  Taller people, be aware.  And it has very little stretch for a Jersey like material, I wish it was a little more on the stretchy side."
4.0,Wife loved it! Not high end jewelry but great for the price.
4.0,Very pretty on my 9 year old.  She loves them and brings them out on many special occasions.
4.0,So far so good. Went on perfectly easy and it was sturdy.
4.0,"It's actually a little more orangish looking in person, but still a nice bow tie that will get some use.  I'll need to find another red tie for the look I'm wanting though.  It's not too shiny, which is what I was afraid of it showing up as, and feels like very nice quality.  I'm still happy with it, just not the color red I was expecting!"
4.0,"This suit was just gorgeous. The material was lovely and very well cut, the tailoring was sharp and the stitching strong. The jacket fit well but the pants were too snug, so I had to return it. I was really disappointed because it looked absolutely fabulous on my wife."
4.0,"They are cheap as can be, and while they protect your eyes, the screw has fallen out of one side, though I was able to replace it. no case as pictured, so 4 stars."
4.0,"My husband has been wearing wristwatches for years, and particularly likes automatic and square shaped watches. I asked him to try out this AOCASDIY brand Men's Square Analog Automatic Watch as it has both features that he enjoys. When I first showed him the Amazon listing for this watch, he was a bit dubious as to the quality of the watch because it was priced so affordably. When it arrived, however, he was pleasantly surprised by how nice this watch turned out to be. This watch has a charming looking dial that is easily readable, and housed in a handsomely attractive black square case. The watch has a clear display case back so he can see the spinning rotor and functioning movement. The black leather watch band with the exposed white stitching, while not the highest quality strap, is still comfortable and looks terrific with the watch. The watch sets and functions as it should. In addition to being a self-winding automatic, this watch also hand winds. My husband noted that the hand winding function felt a little rougher than with some of his more expensive mechanical watches. All the same, it still worked fine. Overall, my husband could not believe how nice this watch turned out to be and is now thinking about ordering the watch in the other 2 color options (Silver and Rose Gold)."
4.0,Waist is a little tight. I am usually a small/medium but returned for a large due to waist( elastic) feeling too tight for how I want pajamas to fit. The sleeves are a little short too. I like the material so returned for a large.
4.0,They are really pretty and I highly recommend to purchase.
4.0,Battery is in the sole and Was not set in place when we received. Once positioned correctly daughter wore them happily.
4.0,These earrings are nice however the clasp is very loose and the earrings come off with the slightest of touch.
4.0,"Good watch, well made and has a very nice look to it."
4.0,"Nice, a little short"
4.0,"Purchased for my daughter. It’s slightly large on her. She’s 5’6, 155. She says it is comfortable though. In the future I’d buy a size down maybe two just to see the different fits. It’s definitely stretchy. Pretty decent dress for the price."
4.0,I made a bunch of really cute keychains with these charms. Great gifts. Love them
4.0,Love the quality but likely see through.
4.0,"Right price,  good quality."
4.0,Good shades for a cheap price.
4.0,"Very nice, well.made strap. The color is great and I love the added tassel!"
4.0,I am a 2x... they fit and are very comfortable. A bit thin but I wear them all the time.
4.0,"This is a very nice jacket for fall weather.  My first complaint is the lack of attention to detail-the US Flag was put on upside down, it is velcro so it is an easy fix but again somethings attention to detail makes the difference.  As for sizing I would recommend ordering a size up, it fit my husband perfect in the arms and across the chest but was a little tight across the bottom of the coat."
4.0,"This necklace looks really nice when I go out somewhere.  I'm very pleased with it, and the price was great too !"
4.0,The fit is close to Size the biggest problem is the blue dye rubs off on everything even after a month he gets on the side of the white tube the stretches on the side of the shoe have deteriorated not sure if I would buy them again and that they got older. These little pebble light things were inside the shoe I don’t see what they had to do with the shoe but every day a couple more would show up. Is this something that belongs in the shoe or is this China get rid of stuff?
4.0,"Comfortable and magnification seems right Keeping them for computer glasses. Not navy blue, more like electric blue."
4.0,Love these!  Stylish!  Comes in a case!  Only gave 4 stars cause the nose pieces fell off BUT I don't care for the price I got it for and how friggin cute they are I still wear them!  Likely will buy more!
4.0,I like this strap but it is too long and when you adjust it to be shorter the padded part of the strap won’t sit on your shoulder.<br />A way to remove excess strap material might work to make it more adjustable.
4.0,Nice bathing suit but the color was off from what is displayed.
4.0,I am 5’7” and about 156 lbs.  not top heavy and this shirt fit with plenty of room.  I’m wearing as a shirt over leggings.  It’s not see through.  Washed well.  I would buy again.
4.0,It was way prettier than I expected.  Also the people liked it and wear it often
4.0,"I like it for sure! Very pretty color, silver detail, and nice feel to it. One of the crystals did fall off though. I kept it in the zipper side of my purse and it must have gotten knocked out. I still have it and will try to glue it back."
4.0,"Nice thin fabric, form fitting, but runs quite small.  I normally wear a large, and their XL is so small it is almost doesn't fit."
4.0,Excellent for face and neck
4.0,"a bit smaller than i would have liked, ... dancing stone is ok, but not brilliant.  4 stars only because there is not enough room to use my better rope chain,  as im always busy,  horses, critters, quad,  etc. and need a good chain,...  it will not fit through the hole.  otherwise,  it truly is adorable.  just smaller than thought.  (:"
4.0,Planning to order in different color.
4.0,Cute & classy!
4.0,I changed my review from 5 stars to 4 stars simply because of the translucent nature of the beads.  The string can be seen through the beads; this is pretty but not as nice as i had hoped.
4.0,Not too bad. Looks nice but can tell how fake it is the closer you look
4.0,Great and soft
4.0,"This is true to size.. i read reviews and is always not sure when it comes in chinese sizes so i ordered a size up, luckily i know how to sew bc i literally had to sew it a size down... other than that cute shirt"
4.0,"Great product, fits individual great! Hard to find size anywhere,  thrilled to be able to find what was needed!"
4.0,"I like this shirt alright, but it IS a bit unflattering. I read so many reviews about how good it looks on everybody, and it just doesn’t on me. I’m not very heavy, not at all skinny. Very middle of the road when it comes to body shape. It’s a bit tight around the middle. Works well for exercise though. Hopefully it’ll look more flattering as I tone up"
4.0,"Fits great, just like their measurements said. I'm a little smaller in the chest so I put a safety pin there to hold it together a little closer. Very flattering and comfortable! Hubby loves it! ;) Only strange thing is that I ordered the navy with white dots and I received black with turqoise dots, it's super cute though."
4.0,Nice color a little complicated getting over head  due to it has a side open zipper.  Nice color not fitting but once you do get it on is nice to wear to wedding etc. .
4.0,Was exactly what was wanted!
4.0,I love this suit It's super flattering. After reading I ordered a size up The color is super lovely and it feels great on! I was worried because I am short and one piece suits usually sag a bit for me but this is actually fairly snug! The price is great I may order another in a different color.
4.0,I do like these bands
4.0,"For some reason, the image made it look like the shorts fade to black. They're just red with a black edge at the bottom.  The lettering did start to look tattered with daily wear (2 mos), but the consensus among the guys was they thought it was supposed to look like that. My son is 6'2&#34; and has a 31&#34; waist.  The Mediums fit in the waist and were adequate in length, though he did wish they were a smidge longer.  It's the best we've found though, so we did order a second pair.  He loved the pockets and feel of them. I took off a star for the lettering, though I must admit, it does look like it is supposed to be distressed."
4.0,Fabric is thinner than expected.
4.0,"The fabric is a little sheer if you stretch them out and the legs are oddly long when compared to the waist ratio. I liked that there's a lot of room in the groin area, where pants seem to always split on my husband. The pattern is bold and bright. Decent pair of sweatpants."
4.0,"Tad bit small but fits. Not great quality but you get what you pay for. This is just our &#34;backyard&#34; swimsuit, we have a thicker better quality for out in public."
4.0,"Bestie for real, excellent"
4.0,Nothing wrong with the shoe.  It just runs a bit small in size and width.  I have to send mine back for that reason.  The shoe itself is great.
4.0,"Not the most stylish and attractive slippers around, but super comfy! Great for around-the-house-wear. Has a decent sole on the bottom so you can step outside without messing up the slipper."
4.0,"I knew these were going to be big, but they are really big!  Like them a lot. The price was good, and the shipping was quick. Good buy."
4.0,"I use these so I don't lose my glasses.  I bought these because I wanted some &#34;dressier&#34; styles.  They are nice looking.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they are quite long and sometimes get stuck behind my back when I lean back in a chair.  So, I am constantly pulling them free but I do wear them and they are pretty."
4.0,"Great ring, doesn’t turn my finger green. The reason why I only gave it four stars is because it bends a little with use, not unlike most of my other rings that are made of the same material."
4.0,"Shipping took forever, and it was thought to be lost in the mail so it was prom to refund my money and then it showed up anyways, the material seems to be of good quality and fits well"
4.0,"This is a very good replica of Hermione’s time turner. Unfortunately, it’s not made out of gold😂 But other than that it looks really good!"
4.0,"bought it for a halloween costume, and made the retro look just right"
4.0,"I received this as a gift and I love the necklace. My only issue was the little book in the back, I felt it just didn't sit right or belong there so I had a jeweler remove it and add it to the necklace near the rabbit. But overall a great piece and I am glad I have it."
4.0,The bracelet was bought as a gift and was a hit. Than you so much.
4.0,works pretty well. I haven't tried it on my really tarnished jewelry yet.
4.0,"somehow makes me itchy if I wear it for too long, but relatively a great product."
4.0,"I really like this. Stretches to white on my wide parts, hopefully that won’t be forever. Awesome for the price, i want to hem it to a tunic length, though."
4.0,This mask looks awesome and scared kids and adults during trick or treating! The only downside was the eye holes. They aren't placed correctly and nearly impossible to see out of. I had to cut the holes bigger. I still recommend this mask though. The hair on it is awesome and the details and lights are super creepy!!
4.0,Looks nice and I think the material felt nice.
4.0,Large isn't hardly large !  I would tell everyone to order a size larger than normal.  Very pretty though !
4.0,"This top is great for the price!  I ended up returning it because the material is a little cheap, almost like what a halloween costume would be made of but not as bad, and the color of the flowers was off.  If I had ordered it sooner for spring or summer, I probably would have kept it but it was an impulse buy and it now October.  No need for a floral, off the shoulder shirt in New England right now."
4.0,So this skirt isn’t as orange as it looks online..it’s closer to a rust color but I still love it! Also the bow belt is optional!
4.0,Very cute charm.  It is tiny but easy to see.  It looks like my Chihuahua puppy.<br />The charm is as pictured and arrived on time.  The print is small but the charm isn't that big.<br />Putting these charms on the bracelet isn't easy.  You have to have both sides open at the same time.  I used a plastic coated paper clip to hold one side open while I opened the other.
4.0,Friend of the family liked it a lot. He wears it all the time.
4.0,"I have an ample booty, so it does go up my butt crack which I don't prefer but for a costume... it's ok."
4.0,"Love the color of the dress, I bought the yellow. The fabric is thin and may be more appropriate for a swimsuit cover up. The medium fits me better after I washed and put it in the dryer. Seemed a bit large before washing and drying. 5’3 150#"
4.0,Looks cute. Wish I would have seen the skull design on the back before purchasing. Might have affected my purchase. Get a lot of compliments though and it fits nice.
4.0,"Love how they feel, soft and stretchy. They run a bit large."
4.0,"I liked the weight of the sweatshirt and trees are cute, just fit a little snug."
4.0,"Cute designs, saw one just like it at a local store for $27.00 for a pair- only bad is one broke - not repairable"
4.0,"I absolutely love these boots, but I had to order a second pair because the bottom rubber breaks off fairly quickly. They fit perfectly, are comfy and I always get compliments on them. I guess you get what you pay for, so only expect them to last for one season."
4.0,Very cute but tight across the bust and I am a 36B.  So order up one size?<br />Holding on to it until I drop 10?
4.0,This was not a good fit for my tiny 6.5 inch wrist. To adjust it to where it fits just right the metal part on the band sat right on that bone on the outside of my wrist and was uncomfortable. To adjust it where it wasn't sitting on that bone it was too big and the weight of my watch would make it slide around on my wrist.
4.0,These are adorable and comfortable but they definitely run small. Order up a size to play it safe.
4.0,"Fit a little longer than anticipated, but it is very comfortable wear"
4.0,Very nice. Well hemmed. Good size.
4.0,They came just as they look and you get a free gift of another piercing my one complaint is that the color wears off overtime
4.0,Read reviews prior to buying. Read some that said the product wasn't long enough. I purchased and XL and it could easily fit someone 5'8 maybe taller. The fabric is thin.
4.0,very cute and my husband LOVES it but this dress is VERY short.  I'm 5'4&#34; 150lb = curvy.  The x large fits great but hits 5 inches above the knee.
4.0,"Our fast growing 2.5-year-old granddaughter absolutely adores pink & when she saw her new pink shoes (size 7) she couldn't wait to wear them. Thankfully, they are a perfect fit with just enough growing room that she'll be able to wear them for a while. I was pleased to see how sturdy & well made they are, too. These shoes are a great buy for the money."
4.0,Very good quality and “adult”. I needed a simple black bag that can be good for work and leisure and this fit the bill. Comes with a shoulder strap as well.
4.0,Good quality but very stiff.<br />And it doesn't work in at all like a leather band.
4.0,"This dress came nicely packaged. I wash everything before I wear it, it comes out the dryer still looking like<br />new. Its not cheap or thin.  Love that it will not need a lot of ironing. The quality looks like it would cost<br />more money. Classy yet comfortable. I should of purchased two. Great buy."
4.0,"Saw the shirt at a good price, so I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised! Other than it being wrinkled (what did I expect, right?) it fits perfectly and looks just like the picture. Note: The material is a little thin/transparent, so expect to wear an undershirt."
4.0,Comfy and they fit as expected
4.0,"The foot part of the sock is really comfortable, unlike more traditional crew socks I bought recently that were a lot more polyester and spandex so they always felt like a second skin and if my foot were a little damp after showering, they were annoying to put on.<br /><br />The downside is the top of the socks are pretty loose so they don't really stay up."
4.0,"We bought this as part of a Halloween costume (my wife was treasure and I was a pirate) and it worked out great. The price is quite low, but the quality is high. Although it was a bit shorter than expected, and a bit more bronze than expected, overall it was a great piece of clothing for the purpose we needed it for."
4.0,This patter is so cute. I ordered what said 2-3 but it will much more fit a 3 or 4t. We'll wait because it's super cute.
4.0,Nice bracelet thinking of buying another one.
4.0,Nice especially getting three in the set however it's to large for my neck so I only gave it four stars.
4.0,A bit of a boxy cut. Material is nice.
4.0,😖😱🤔👌👌👌
4.0,"Delivered to L.A., CA: fast less than 7 days.<br />Appearance of product: gold colored belt looks more like yellow glitter but thats kinda how the picture looked.<br />Quality of product: good<br />Size: there was no way to figure out the sizings<br />Overall opinion: fast delivery, looks exactly as pictured, simple packaging but i don't think i will be using it. If the gold was a richer shade, it would have been perfect."
4.0,"I love the idea of the elastic belt, especially for hiking, or activities where you really want your pants to stay up well, but don't want anything to restricting or tight. Overall I'm quite pleased with this product, I was a bit nervous about the plastic buckle, I found it easy to operate, and surprisingly sturdy. It was very simple to cut it to fit, and looks nice with clothes.<br />My only criticism, is that the elastic is a little hard / stiff, and while that does help it keep its shape nicely, it can cut into you a bit when sitting down or bending over.<br />I would still recommend this product. Bottle cap for size comparison."
4.0,Beautiful but too large at hips. Seams stick out and bag:(
4.0,"I bought this band as a replacement for the stock band that came with my Pebble Smartwatch. Overall, I love having the band and it gives the Pebble a more professional look. The clasp works really smoothly and opens with just a touch, but requires enough of a touch that it doesn't just fall open after touching a table. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have noticed that the paint on the outer side tends to wear down over time, especially if you have your hand on a table or desk a lot. Personally, I like it. The wear gives the band some character.<br /><br />Also, the band shipped from China, but I was surprised at how fast it came in. I had to double check that it came from China because the speed it came in nearly matched the speed of Prime items."
4.0,"I just wanted to mention that this is a ladies fit tshirt - it is not a boxy tshirt, but rather has a little bit of a tuck. However that is not to say that it is form fitting, it is not. It is loose enough not to cling.<br />Great color, exactly as pictured. Very soft cotton."
4.0,HAVE NOT WORE THEM YET BUT I LOVE EM
4.0,I didnt realize they were big studs. I wanted them for my top ear hole but they will do.
4.0,"I like to keep my class ring nice and shiny by using this polishing cloth about once a week.  It only takes me a couple of minutes, and the ring always looks brand new.  I get about two years worth of use before having to replace it."
4.0,Very cute! Girls can be active without worrying about showing their panties.
4.0,it's a fun necklace and the price is great even for costume jewelry
4.0,"Fun watch to wear for a high-end look, at an affordable price!"
4.0,too haevy
4.0,Nice mask. Colors are just as pretty in person. I bought to use when riding the motorcycle with the hubby...but it also came in handy for the pandemic ...thick material. Will be perfect for winter...kinda too thick for summer/spring.<br />But all in all still happy with the purchase.
4.0,Cool or kool these rectangular throwback glasses are nice with a light tint an comes with cleaning towel an bag to carry them in
4.0,I am 5’7 and 38D and weigh 175. I ordered a large-material is nice<br />This dress fits perfect.<br />Will look dressy with some nice jewelry .
4.0,Love them... great to workout in.... Very comfortable and they stayed on my waist the whole time that I worked out. Also they are very flattering on a woman that has curves.
4.0,Beautiful runs a little small
4.0,"The scarf is great it is perfect for this cold  weather,  only wish it had some stretch, the 4 stars is because there was to be a support our troops bracelet with the scarf and there was not."
4.0,"cheap suit.  Buttons fell off.  But, for $100 its ok.  Actually fits really well on me.  I use it as a costume for gangster night dancing."
4.0,"First time using this product; little thicker than originally thought but, worked nicely for our &#34;walking dead&#34; event."
4.0,"Mostly true to character, though the white decals on the side don't go as far back as the anime design. Its a bit tight. I ordered a medium even though I'm a US Small and it was still tight in some areas. Otherwise, it's a great costume."
4.0,I was able to see my daughter wear this shirt.  She wore it with a nursing cami.
4.0,Looks huge but wash and dry and shrinks nicely
4.0,A little small and has no pockets :(
4.0,"I like the sheerness of this product, but idk if it's just me since i'm pregnant now, but the legs are a little too tight than i expected. Im usually a medium and sometimes a small. I know the belly makes a difference, but im talking about the legs.. i haven't gained too much weight as of now, but the tights barely reach the center of my thighs... might rephrase since i don't know if i explained myself well enough. Anyways, ordered a M"
4.0,This is a nice basic sweatshirt. It looks nice on. Doesn’t look like the most expensive but decent. Looks just like the product image.
4.0,"This scarf is soft, elegant and works well for the office."
4.0,I love them. Look exactly like the picture and for their price? Amazing!
4.0,"You know, this is really Christmas-y and not ugly so you can just get into the spirit or give as gift!  Medium weight, neither flimsy thin or heavy bulky.  The knit of material isn't tight but you can't see through either.  The arms are long, not tight fitting, the cuffs + bottom of the sweater are ribbed but none are what you would call the tight fit of like sweatshirt cuffs.  This actually has all the colored knit on the reverse of front, like one whole piece is joined at arm holes + seams...where attached you see some of the white yarns holding it together. That's probably the ugliest thing about it.  Wear it, enjoy"
4.0,It is comfortable but not padded so I would wear this with dark colors if you don't want anything to show.
4.0,"This was super cute on my daughters! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the skirt was really big but other than that, we loved it!"
4.0,"it is very nice, however a bit on the small side."
4.0,Nice top. A bit sheer. Defiantly size up.
4.0,"Very nice and comfortable, but too low."
4.0,The hat is perfect except that it doesn't fit as baggy as I was looking for like in the picture. It doesn't sit on my head as shown. I have to actually pull my hair up and tuck it inside otherwise I love it.
4.0,I. Use them they're perfect and
4.0,"Point of Ref: 5'3&#34; at 158lbs (36, 30, 40). Normally a size 8 or M in dresses.<br />Great Value. Professional and casual look. Not too fond of the belt."
4.0,"Ordered a 10, my size, since reviews here are all over the place, it is really small, more like a 9.  I put the sole up against other shoes I have that are similar and there is a big difference with this shoe being much smaller every time.  I'm glad the seller allows free returns.  Sorry they don't have a bigger size I needed these shoes."
4.0,Very nice sleek look good quality I wear mine all the time
4.0,Nice bag but not that easy to lock. I have been pulling the straps in and out to loosen it up some. Still difficult to get the locking loop exposed. The locking feature is nice if you need that.
4.0,"My grandsons loved it. The material is a little bit different,  but they say it's comfortable 👍"
4.0,will stretch well made
4.0,"When I ordered this necklace originally, it came with a few small defects. The defects were small imperfections in the frame, and a a little bit of glue on the stone. The stone was perfect and lovely. I spoke with the company and not only did they sincerely apologize for all of the minor issues, but also replaced it with a much nicer version without question or hesitation.<br />The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars, is that the initial item wasn't as perfect as the replacement, but once they were aware of the issue, they went out of their way to ensure I was satisfied. The customer service alone is worth all 4 stars."
4.0,Very cute fashion glasses! Having fun with them!
4.0,"My husband Loved his ring!! He's hasn't worn his original wedding band since the day we were married, due to it was uncomfortable. When I saw this band I decided to order it for him since our 11th anniversary was this year. The style, price, but most important comfort was the deciding factor. And now he has worn it, and tells me how comfortable it is.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because I'm not sure how well it will hold up. Once it's proven its self then I will up it to a 5 star rating.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product, based upon my own personal experience.

4.0,The product did last long.so I was happy with that watch.
4.0,When I saw these Pretty Baby Gifts - Shiny Handmade Tassels Soft Sole Shoes First Step in Learning to Walk Baby Shoes I was in love. I couldn't wait to get these and try them out on my little girl. They looked so adorable and I loved the gold color and the added sparkles. I also loved that I was able to choose from a few different color options. They did take a little bit longer to arrive since prime shipping was not an option and they were coming from another country but that wasn't a huge issue for me. The shoes looked exactly as pictured and I was very happy with them. the little fringes are a cute little touch. The only issue that I found with these shoes was that they were a little wider then I think they should be. Other than that thought I was very happy with this product. I will definitely be recommending these Pretty Baby Gifts - Shiny Handmade Tassels Soft Sole Shoes First Step in Learning to Walk Baby Shoes to my family and friends. I bought this product at a discounted price in order to leave my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,"I have very petite wrists, and I've struggled to find a FitBit that was small enough that it fit my wrist without gaps. So I was devastated when my Flex 2 died recently. A friend gave me a Charge 3 to try, and while the device is close to the size of the Flex 2 (see picture), I was seriously struggling with the out-of-box band. Could not get it comfortable and it was rubbing badly on my wrist; definitely couldn't sleep in it.<br /><br />I went looking for replacement bands, and thought I'd try this one since it attaches similar to how the Flex 2 band does (a pin in a hole, rather than a buckle). I have been nothing but happy since the moment I put it on! The silicone (or whatever material it is) is much softer and smoother than the band that comes with the Charge 3. It's easy to put on and get sized *correctly*, which has eliminated the rubbing on my wrist. It's even comfortable enough to sleep in!<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got the Small size band, and even with my tiny wrists, I'm wearing it on the next to last hole. As in, almost as large as it can go - if my wrists were any larger, I'd probably need the Large size band. That seems a bit off to me, so just be aware of it if you have mid-to-large wrists<br /><br />Tip: the band has a little slot that you can tuck the ""tongue"" (the loose end of the band) into after you insert the pin into the desired hole to latch it. At first I made the mistake of trying to tuck the end in and then insert the pin, and was having a hard time, until I realized you're actually supposed to insert the pin first and then tuck in the end - so much easier that way!"
4.0,"Nice shirt, but runs small.  I normally wear a large, but I had to reorder an extra large.  I weigh 149 and am 5'4&#34;.  The quality of shirt is great though."
4.0,Purchased for my daughter and she loves it. Jacket is perfect and very soft inside
4.0,Fun to wear over tank tops
4.0,"A bit too baggy for me, but I'm small chested. It was very soft and would probably look great on an average woman."
4.0,Does not fit that right.
4.0,"This is cute, but definitely order a size up. I’m 5’5” 130 and normally do small, but I got a medium and thankfully I did. The shirt is a bit cropped and shorts are small, but nothing too bad."
4.0,"They're good and feel comfortable but a little tight. I normally wear an 8.5, if you're feet are any bigger they may not fit. They look great with my converse shorelines"
4.0,"This top is super cute but it looked really big on my body.  Perhaps with a smaller size it might look better but it is a very, very wide, flowing style and wasn't flattering to my figure.  I ordered my normal size XL, and it was plenty big.  the fabric is a heavier weight and I wanted something cool for the hot summer ahead.  But all in all it is very cute and on someone with a better figure it would be great."
4.0,"Great colors and great quality, but it’s way too small! I wear a size small and ordered a large because of some current chemotherapy issues I am going through.<br />This large was tight on me."
4.0,I love this 2 piece swimsuit.I can say the top was a struggle to put on. I’m a 40G 206 lbs. I got a 2x
4.0,Nice quality product however it did run on the big side as far as sizing goes.
4.0,My 8yo likes these and uses them as play shoes. They are true to size and decent comfort.
4.0,These work great I used them with my masks I made in the washer and dryer and they stayed on!
4.0,This earrings are pretty cute and I really like the colors but they are small in size compare to the picture they have on the site. They are also nicely well made.
4.0,It's been six months since I purchased this shirt for my son.. Great fit & holds up well with washer and dryer..
4.0,"Dress arrived swiftly and in good condition, looks just like pictured on site.<br /> I'm 5'8"" and weigh about 165 (full 36C bust), ordered a large (their XL) as reviews indicated to order a size up. Must say it's a little big, should have just ordered a medium. Since it's a bit larger, the slit in the skirt doesn't gape open, which I prefer. The neckline PLUNGES so the dress being a little too large makes the neckline gape, revealing more than I feel comfortable with. But again, a simple alteration will fix that. Overall, I'm happy with the dress. It looks just like in the picture, comfortable and is well made. I didn't notice the sequins sleeves bothering me as some reviews stated, maybe after time?  I will add a warning about the zipper though. It's a bit stiff and the sequins material tends to get caught in it if you're not very careful. The dress is a bit stretchy so you can easily pull overhead in a pinch."
4.0,"I'm in love with this dress, however I'm having to return  or should I say do an exchange because  it's to  big of a fit.  Hoping the replacement  is here in time for the event."
4.0,"We got these for a costume, and they were perfect!"
4.0,This item runs a little small so order up a size. The design is adorable and the material is very soft and comfortable.
4.0,My son has a beard<br />He likes these very much<br />They are adjustable and light
4.0,"I wear this when I have to shovel the driveway in the winter. It keeps my ears and head warm, and also covers some neck. It is so soft and looks cute."
4.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for, and are very comparable to Gymshark style. I would say these are about 75% squat proof, so I do feel comfortable running in them. but I don't think I would wear them to the gym. Overall I do like these a lot and will most likely be ordering more in other colors."
4.0,"The material is nice and thick and extremely soft. It has an adjustable strap to help it stay up. My only dislike was the ""S"" in splatoon is cut off."
4.0,"Gorgeous bag, I love the pockets, I just wish I could use the big strap, and take off the small ones. When I do, the buckle part from the small one sticks up, and I work with children and I could see one running face first into the sharper part."
4.0,Nice hat and should work great to keep my head warm
4.0,Would be perfect if no polyester!
4.0,My daughter loved the pjs very soft great buy
4.0,"good fit, clear shield as shown, but was folded and not shipped flat the plastic is bent which makes it awkward and not ""hanging"" exactly right. I rolled it up and put in a cylinder for a while to see if that would help it but I think it needed heat to get it out and I am not willing to risk damaging. You would think they would have thought the effect folding plastic and shipping it might affect how it hangs."
4.0,fit very well will will buy again.
4.0,"This ring is great for men that are hard on their hands.  It's very solid and is a decent weight. The only thing to be cautious of is sizing.  Due to the material of the ring, it cannot be sized (smaller or larger)."
4.0,This is a cute but runs small. I am currently breastfeeding and I wear a small undershirt with this. If I didn't it would be too revealing. Only one button in front
4.0,I like the fit. They are comfortable
4.0,"This is a stylish and comfortable tank, I'm used to racing tops and they are much lighter and thinner,  this one just seemed too hot to run in. But great fit."
4.0,The pants fit and look great! The sizing chart was very accurate. Feels nice too would definitely buy again if black medium was in stock ;)
4.0,"This is a nice summer dress and feels good to wear. Very float.<br /><br />It is a little in the short side, coming just above my ankles. But I can live with that."
4.0,The dress is very nice but so so small.  I don't know what Xtra large person it is suppose to fit?  A size 5 maybe!!  So if you are a small person the dress will be fine!!!
4.0,Ok to use one time.  Leaks by soft hand washing.
4.0,"Cant beat it for the price, only concern is all the caveats concerning ITS WATER RESISTANCE"
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress. It is so cute and comfy. I am a size six and I ordered a large (two sizes up) as others suggested. My one issue is that it is very low cut, so I plan on sewing a snap into the top to keep anything from showing. I would definitely recommend this dress."
4.0,Cute top but never got to wear.  First got large.  Way too big. Got medium still big.  So I haven't worn either.  Seems like it would be cute and fabric is somewhat nice. Order at least 2 sizes smaller.
4.0,Never tried before but needed for a certain pair of shoes - worked well!
4.0,"Not bad for the price. be prepared it's a very large watch. But the White Dial makes it stand out. I changed out the White rubber Band, for a Black Leather Rally Band with Red stitches (White stitches looks good also). Looks much better!!"
4.0,"I liked the jacket and it was well made.  But, in the end, I decided it was too similar to other jackets I have and I returned it in favor on another jacket."
4.0,Product must be altered! Average fabric quality. Would have liked heavier gauge material.
4.0,This is a well made backpack. It is sturdy and the stitching is great. It looks llike it will hold up for a long time. There are only 2 negative things I have to say about it. Mine didnt come with the waist or chest straps. Also the arm adjustment strap has no form of stopper so the first time I tried to put it on it came completely out and I had to relace it.
4.0,"This was bought as a gift for my niece who is 4 months old. If it doesn’t fit now, it will later😁"
4.0,It's a cute dress. It was a little loose because my wife lost weight. She would have liked the sleeves to be a bit longer.
4.0,I like MOST of the jewelry that came with this. Some if the nose rings have a sharp edge on them and I had to file them down with a metal file. There are some really cute designs! Good for the price.
4.0,"Great color, wide enough to protect back of the neck and tops of the ears!"
4.0,"This really works.  The soft velvet strip on the inside does not slip and the band is comfortable, not overly tight.  Works well for working outside in the heat and for running."
4.0,"This dress was super comfy and light! I received so many compliments!!! The only thing is be careful with the material it can get snags very easily. But again, completely worth the price and perfect for the summer!!!"
4.0,"Very cute chain, I wear this as a belt. Decently sturdy durably material."
4.0,"I liked this jumpsuit but it is a little odd to get adjust correctly. Length was okay, any shorter and I would have returned. Overall okay for what I needed it for and the cost."
4.0,"We are using these for a circus themed work event.  We bought these shirts and returned one that was too large, but they fit as expected and when washed, didn't shrink.  Not something most people will want to get a lot of wear from (I don't think!), but will be great for our event.  Will add pictures after....."
4.0,"The inlays went well together and everything arrived intact, although I had to file one of the edges due to it being a bit rough on one edge.  Other than that, they are lightweight great every day plugs. Make sure you take them out before you shower, the water can loosen the glue on the inlays over time."
4.0,My favorite tote.  I'll probably buy another one in another color.
4.0,Exactly what I ordered. Fit was good. Had a very strong chemical smell out of the bag- Must wash before wearing.
4.0,"New style, took awhile to get used to."
4.0,I loved this bracelet! It went together well with two others that I wear all the time. Unfortunately I lost it recently. I'm guessing I must have got it caught on something and it broke.
4.0,I wasn’t sure about these at first. The pictures make them look super thin like tights even though they say they are for yoga. In reality the thickness is somewhere in between. They are really well made and are pretty much seamless. They were really hard to put on and are a little too tight but they are cute. I especially like the fishnet detail on the backs of the legs. Also I think the diagonal stripes should be angled the opposite direction because this way kind of makes your legs look thicker than they are.
4.0,Material is thin which is nice for a big guy like me.
4.0,This dress is great for summer and it has pockets! Looks great with a light cardigan or a jean jacket.
4.0,I ordered the swim set in size 4xl and I'm overjoyed by the outcome. The swimsuit fits perfectly and the set looks EXACTLY like the picture. The only reason why I'm give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I wish the cover up was a little bit bigger. I would've loved to be able to tie / pin the cover up closed. Overall...very nice set.
4.0,Beautiful colors and soft material if your looking for something different than the normal reds and blue dresses but runs very small.
4.0,"I really like this dress. Fit is good. It’s a bit longer than I thought it would be. And it’s more casual than I thought but it works for me. I’m 5’3”, 155 lbs"
4.0,Very constable
4.0,"I do like the print, it seems comfortable, but the cups are a bit weird... THe padded cup is a bit small for the size of the fabric.. Have not worn it yet to swim, but I do like how it looks.... I am usually a 20 to a 24, I ordered the 6xl and I would say it was a good fit, not tight and the bottoms had good coverage and came high enough on the waist to not cause a muffin top..Worth the money"
4.0,I wish the neckline was a little bit higher.
4.0,They are good quality. They are thin which I like because my feet get hot easily. They are a little big for me but that is a pretty common problem for me so it must just be that I have small feet.
4.0,Pretty impressed with the fit and quality of this top. I got this on lightening deal for a great price.
4.0,"Love the feel of the material and warmth. They are not easy for me to put on. Once in place, they are perfect, as beautiful as expected, and the detailed trim sets them off. Despite the snugness, these are the very best gloves I’ve ever owned/worn. I’m very pleased."
4.0,They were really cute just a little small. She wears a 13 in Nike brand but some brands are different
4.0,It's cute  for the occasion and price.
4.0,The material is quite soft but is a bit on the thin side. On the model it looks like a short dress. I am 5'6 and it is a shirt with a peplum on me. I expected this but others might not. The color is true to image.
4.0,to small but still wearable.
4.0,"Great dress for the price. I got many compliments on it. The top could have been better, but overall it served its purpose. I got a size 10. I'm 5'3&#34;, 150lb, and a 36D. It fit pretty well."
4.0,Nice skirt and color but was too big
4.0,"Really nice dress, but it hugs every curve and the neckline is too deep for me. So, I had to return it.  I am 5'3 /145 and I ordered the large because I thought it would be a little loose.  I should have ordered an XL.  The material is soft and very stretchy and feels really nice on your body.  Overall, I would recommend this product.  You will definitely have to order up one or two sizes depending on your body type.  ****"
4.0,If you going to order this dress you should order down one size.
4.0,Not a bad product. Print is slightly different but item was too long and slightly big. Returning.
4.0,"It's a very good looking skirt, never found such a nice looking fake leather skirt for this price. However, I could JUST get into the large size of this skirt, so I ordered a XL too, but there is no difference is size. The skirt looks good enough that I want to wear it anyway, but too bad that the sizes are a little off. If you have curves, it will be very hard to get into it. But if you don't, it's a really nice skirt!"
4.0,"Unbelievably soft, but mine was a bit too small."
4.0,"This is the second set I buy; my daughter likes them. I bought 12-14  and I think  they are kind of small, but maybe she is just taller than average , still a good purchase though."
4.0,"fits perfectly around the body (stretchy as well), only problem i have are the straps… they fall easily or feel too tight so it leaves red marks on ur arms.. im sure there is a way to fix this but overall decent dress for the price! very nice fitting around the waist"
4.0,Arrived just as and when expected. Looks good and seems to be of good quality and a good value.
4.0,Cuts off at my chest....but it's still a cute dress
4.0,i like that they arrived when i needed them
4.0,I don't hv anything negative to say except the delivery drivers do NOT know how to follow my instructions!!!
4.0,Smaller than on photo
4.0,I ordered an XL and it was the equivalent of a US medium. Not the seller's fault. I should have paid better attention to the measurements!
4.0,I loved this costume. I was the lion and my grandma was my lion tamer. The dress did shed quite a bit but It was a really comfy outfit and i got tons of compliments on the boots. I wore some wedged timberland shoes and layered the fur leg piece.
4.0,"I was already familiar with this shirt. It is a very good looking shirt, but just like many other brands, the problem is that so many brands that I have tried as an experiment just do not last very long before they start getting those familiar pin holes in them. Many t-shirts in the past sometimes have lasted years. Now some of them degrade after a few short months. One particular brand only lasted 3 washings! The cotton quality has seemed to have changed overall."
4.0,"These socks are like wearing massagers on your feet! They are form fitting and supportive, non sweat and wash up great!  Only minor issue the cuff up the legs are a bit too tight. But overall great!"
4.0,"Simple, but look nice."
4.0,A little see through but great!
4.0,"I am a thin, small framed woman (about 5''0&#34;) who has a little &#34;pouch&#34; that I am always trying to hide. When I saw this top I thought it would be perfect for me. I loved the style and the colors that were available. I decided to choose the small in dark lavender.<br /><br />When I received it, the color wasn't the dark lavender that I had expected. It was more of a rose pink color. I still think it is pretty though. The material is 95% RAYON / 5% SPANDEX. It is very comfortable and lightweight!<br /><br />Because of my height, I could wear this as a dress but I am sure for others that are of average height, wearing it with leggings would probably be more favorable. I still wear it with leggings myself and it looks even cuter with a nice long necklace or a scarf!<br /><br />Even through washing it in the washer and drying it in the dryer, the color never ran and the top didn't shrink.<br /><br />I gave this a 4 star rating only because of the color not being what I had expected, however, it really is a great top!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I always have relied on reviews to determine whether or not I want to purchase a product. I hope my review will help others as well."
4.0,nice belt good price
4.0,"Fits as expected, love the  look! It is light enough to wear in any season. Only down side is the corners snag very easy, so just bewear of were you are walking and where you store the scarf"
4.0,Looks better in blue
4.0,The elastic band is too tight.
4.0,Nice shirt but s little tight in waist
4.0,"They seem super huge when you get them, and the details aren't .. Well the picture is about as good as it looks. But nonetheless he is a nerd and still loved them lol."
4.0,Nice skirt look great and good fit.
4.0,I sought this brand for my Mother; I had previously purchased the same socks or similar for her at a retail store.  My Mom finds them more comfortable than other support hose she has tried.  The quality seems reasonably good as well.
4.0,I’m shocked that this dress is only $26!!! I returned it because I’m not busty enough for the top to stay in place and the length needed to be longer to look better. But the quality is superb for the cost. It’s a thicker stretchy material so I do recommend this to anyone who has the body shape to pull this off. It’s a cheap dress but looks expensive.
4.0,Love the bracelet. It broke after a while because it kept getting caught in clothing.
4.0,I'm giving it a four stars because it was a little tight and I brought it for a Gift for an adult but it was nice maybe for a teenager will be good and the price and shipping was good.
4.0,Fit big around the chest and I feared it wouldn’t stay up. Not much structure to the chest area.
4.0,"These are nice, simple handkerchiefs.  They're just printed with colorful flowers - pretty basic.  I'm hoping they soften after repeated washings.  They held up well after two washes so far.  I'm pleased with them for the price I paid."
4.0,The top was a little short but beautiful.
4.0,"Fun Halloween glasses. Purchased early before (all) Halloween items increased in price, including this one. A bit cheaply made but they aren't expensive and won't be used too much. The glasses legs pop out so you have to pop them back in every so often. Still, happy with purchase as they will just be used sparingly between now and Halloween."
4.0,Nice looking top that fits well.
4.0,Runs a smidge large. But great top.
4.0,I bought it has gift my sister loves it wears it every day
4.0,"I got this sweater as a promo-free for an honest opinion. To give you me specs I am 6’0” and have 41” chest 31” waist. I usually wear things a little slimmer since regular fit medium usually hangs on me because the the stomach area is just too big. Unfortunately this sweater seems more like a tall-sized sweater because even at 6’ the bottom hem extends almost 5” past my waist. The sleeves also extend well past my wrist by about 3”. Again if I were about 6’4” this would be a great length.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is the softest fabric I’ve ever felt, the blue that I got is just gorgeous, and the white trim is a beautiful contrast. I’d probably need a small to make it work for me. The only thing is that as nice as it is, I doubt I’d spend $50 to buy a quarter zip sweater no matter how nice it was."
4.0,"Very cute, runs big and wide."
4.0,Fits well. A little thin but very cute.
4.0,"Obviously the material of the actual product is a lower quality than that in the preview, but it still looks pretty good. Fit was a little tight for me, bought a Lg and I'm 5'8"" at 155 lbs. The zipper should have gone down the back further though as there is no stretch or give to the material. I'm thinking I'm going to rip the dress eventually."
4.0,It's beautiful the only thing is you can't shower with it if you have a picture inside.  Water slips in thru the wings.
4.0,"Cute, well-made. Pricey but supports a good cause while keeping tiny feet warm."
4.0,"I usually wear a 14.  I ordered the large.  It fits perfect.  I also purchased the dress in purple back in late winter/early spring and the purple dress had pockets.  It was also made with thicker material (assuming because of the season) and I like the thicker material better.  So, when I received this one, it was a little thin like a really thin t-shirt.  This teal dress does not have pockets and looks better.  The dress can be dressed up with heels or down with flat sandals.  I only gave 4 stars because of how thin it is but I will probably order a few more in other colors."
4.0,This belt was exactly as described. I bought several others from different sellers on amazon and this was the only one that looked exactly as pictured. I am a size 4 and the small fit just fine.
4.0,Didn't read well enough to realize they were mesh. Still a good lightweight tank though!
4.0,"I ordered these compression socks because I struggle with plantar fasciitis and varicose veins. I also work frequent 12 hour shifts and am standing most of the day. I have found that compression socks help ease the pain and swelling when worn consistently. These socks were thicker than the other brand of socks I already had. I thought this may be a good thing as it will offer more support throughout the day. The size I ordered was slightly large in the foot area and tight in the upper part of my calf, which was to be expected as I have somewhat large calves.  I would prefer they had a men's version and women's version since women tend to have smaller feet while some of us have larger calves. However, I was still able to wear these without much discomfort, as in the benefits outweighed the slight size issue. They've held up well, and haven't lost their elasticity. I like the extra padding around the sole of the foot. These socks are breathable, soft, and not overly constricting. Overall, I'm pleased with them and feel relief when wearing them. I also noticed they have a money back guarantee so if the sizing is off one can always return. I received a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Product is good quality but runs small! Size 2t-4t fits 2t at most! More like a 12-24 month fit compared to other socks.
4.0,The green is very pretty. The lace is delicate & it requires a shirt to be worn underneath. The only negative is the sleeves are a little long.
4.0,It does ride up when you walk unless you’re wearing stockings. But it’s sexy and greatly made. Easy to wash.
4.0,Could not use because the dress I was planning to wear was changed
4.0,Beautiful but heavy. Pulling on my ear loobs all day at work. Better for parties or for shorter durations.
4.0,Do yourself a favor and do not apply directly over bare skin
4.0,I loved these more than I thought I would. Great fit. Comfortable enough to layer.
4.0,Fit well. Great price.
4.0,Good snapback.I like the designs and logos a lot but it fit kind of on the small side(or maybe I just have an enormous head). If I adjust it all the way to the largestsetting(the last hole) I can wear it comfortably.<br />Other than that great hat
4.0,"These are a little heavier than i expected, but not uncomfortable at all. Keeps them from swinging wildly, which i appreciate. Took a long time to arrive, i guess they came from China. They look good and don't feel cheap."
4.0,"Very attractive shoe with a good heel. Well made, but a bit on the small size for a double width. Hopefully, it will stretch out. Also, the strap is very long and will need to punch in a couple more holes for the fit."
4.0,Very cute. I use it as my work bag
4.0,Well done but runs very small going to exchange for a bigger size
4.0,I loved the design and the look. But the quality was not as expected and the material did not feel good.i feel it was see through in light and thankfully I got black. I would have returned it if not for the trip I was taking the next day and I had plans for this dress.<br />I usually wear a medium or large t shirts . But after reading the reviews I got a small and it fit perfectly.<br />Be sure to size down when u buy.
4.0,"It's exactly as pictured.... a teeny bit &#34;thicker' than I expected (especially at the hinge end) but not as enormous as many.  I just wanted a simple tie clip for my son's school uniform (chemistry lab + tie = anxious mother looking for tie clip) -- nothing extravagant, nothing silly... and this is perfect.  Good price, too."
4.0,"This is a really nice autumn-leafy-orange scarf. It feels soft and cozy and is big enough to use as a hood if it's freezing and you forget to bring a hat. It works as a shawl or as a scarf. It is quite bulky, though, like it takes up half my backpack. When I first put it on and showed it to my sister she asked if it was a towel, and she wasn't joking or teasing me. And that made me feel like that picture of Lenny Kravitz. This scarf is probably better worn as a wrap or hood.<br /><br />I'll update if it pills or anything but so far it looks and feels really nice for acrylic."
4.0,Buy one size larger!! I’m
4.0,I bought this for my mother and it meant so much to her because of the flower on it had a meaning to her. Worth the buy.
4.0,"I love them. They were a little bigger than I expected, or maybe my ears are just smaller than I thought. 😆"
4.0,The Good: Well made and nice color variety.  Tassels make for easy attaching.<br /><br />The Bad: Does not provide super powers.<br /><br />Overall: Purchased for Superhero Puppet production.  Happy with purchase.
4.0,"Great quality, fit as expected."
4.0,A little see through and tighter than expected
4.0,Cute jumpsuit... Bought this in white and material is very see through.  Runs a little smaller than expected with a low crotch  (nothing a good girdle can't handle)and long legs.  I ordered XL I'm 5'9 200lbs with a little belly
4.0,"This was on my daughter’s wishlist.  The negative would be long time from ordering to arrival.  I ordered in November, and finally received it a few days AFTER Christmas.  Minus 1 star for shipping.  She likes how it fits, and it looks cute on her."
4.0,"Great deal, very cute design, and fast shipping. It was surprising to find that the hole in the panties was so far oriented to the back, and the panties run a bit on the small side, Which are the only downsides. Definitely worth buying!"
4.0,Great organizer for our family of 4.
4.0,What was needed
4.0,"I really like this jacket, it's soft, comfortable, warm without being too heavy, and I love the color too.  I would give it 5 stars it weren't for the fact that one of the button holes, the one on the bottom is not open, the stitching is there but the hole is not.  I will have to cut it to open it, haven't done that yet, hopefully it will be ok after I do."
4.0,"Love the floral print, super soft fabric and the purple tee I purchased color wise ...I’m obsessed with it! For me so times I can wear a med or large size but glad I got the med in this case would have been to big."
4.0,"I'm 5'2, 125lbs and purchased a medium.  It fit like a medium, but note it is form fitting, thin, and slinky/sexy.  Be sure you have either the figure to wear it with confidence or purchase a very good, smoothing undergarment.  It is not lined, so everything you wear will show through unless you plan carefully.  It is a pretty dress if you can pull it off, great for a Christmas party or a night out when you want to look classy but drive him wild.  For the price it's worth purchasing."
4.0,"Very nicely made bag, that comfortably hold the basics. The front catch is a little hard to get used to, but, with practice, you can do it with one hand. Since I always use it &#34;cross body&#34;, I would have prefered the center hand to be removeable."
4.0,"Very cute necklace, but falls off really easily. Found it inside my bra twice and then I lost it. Looks and feels great for the price."
4.0,"I love the bag. I just expected it to be a touch bigger. Also, I wish the hardware was silver not gold. Otherwise fantastic. Use daily."
4.0,"This dress is very cute!  I am 5'1&#34; and 110 ilbs, 34 D, I ordered a small and it fits great.  There is a little room under the arms but not so much to cause a problem, skirt is a little thin."
4.0,"They looked super small coming outta the package, but they did actually fit my 12 year old boy. Good buy."
4.0,They seem to be of fair quality. For what I need them for they will workout just fine. So far I can’t find anything wrong with the earrings
4.0,A little small but good for cosplay
4.0,"Neck is kinda tight, looking at the pic now I realize it is supposed to be like that"
4.0,Hermoso lo recomiendo
4.0,Somewhat small but did not stop my 5 year from wearing. He loves this hat!
4.0,The suit was easy to get on. I like the built in hand coverings.  The zipper chafed my granddaughters face.  Also there is no way to tighten the hood so it is useless. Just falls off.
4.0,pretty and very dainty
4.0,This is a great look!  I wanted something large and fashion forward and this is it. The bracelet was quite large and needing links removed. My local jewelry store did this for $10. And it keeps time quite well. So far so good. I received compliments the first time I wore it.
4.0,"The sleeves are very tight fit and cant put my arm through. However, the rest of the shirt is fine. Very strange. I might have to just tie around my waist until I slim down."
4.0,I absolutely love the look of this piece it's a definite show stopper. Disappointed that it arrived with defective clasp but it's an easy fix. Overall a must have.
4.0,"The cups run a bit small, but the band is fine. I am ok with the smallish cups because with the dress I'll be wearing it with (strapless dress with plunging neckline), I need some almost invisible support. This bra fits my needs perfectly! Even strapless it stays up and stays in place."
4.0,These are very pretty. The only complaint I have is that they lean forward and expose a good portion of the tube. I replaced it with a sturdier pair that I already own and now I love them.
4.0,Arrived as ordered.  Great fit
4.0,"I bought the dress knowing full well it would be an imported brand (i.e.- something from overseas) which means things tend to run smaller and be made with lower-quality material. For the price ($30 at the time of purchase), I figured I'd give it a shot, plus if it was truly awful I could send it back per Amazon's &#34;free return&#34; option on the dress.<br /><br />To my surprise, the dress itself is not bad at all. The fabric is a stiffer type of cotton, but not rigid and unwearable. It does smell a little &#34;chemical&#34; like out of the sealed bag you get it in, but one wash and the smell is gone. The length is fine and cuts to the knees. The cut for the natural waistline is a little higher on myself and probably on most people (I have an average-sized torso, so this dress might fit better on shorter torso versus longer), but the width of the belt hides that a little.<br /><br />The two biggest issues of the dress is that for one, it's unlined. Even a simple thin white satin lining would have done wonders for this dress. The fabric is a little see-through, so you'll either have to enjoy people knowing what color bra you have on, or wear a tank top/underskirt combo, nude undergarments, or a full slip to hide your colorful intimates. The second biggest issue is the sizing in the arms. I am by no means a super thin woman, and I will admit my arms a little bigger up top from being formerly overweight and having some fluffy skin hanging around like stubborn bat wings. But the arms actually fit, at their worst, at the elbow line. Every time I bend, I'm afraid I might rip the dress. If I had gone up a size, the arms may have fit better, but since the dress fits everywhere else perfectly, I would have hated to have an oversized dress simply in the name of the arms. I may hem the sleeves up slightly and add in a little fabric to match or compliment it if it continues to bother me.<br /><br />Overall, the dress is worth the price, and delivery was fabulous (go Amazon Prime!), and if I had the choice, I'd buy it again. I do like it, I just don't love it."
4.0,"This one was hard to rate. On one end, the quality of the stiching and the wallet in general looked very good. On the other end, the pockets for the cards were really tight and when all of the pockets had cards at the same time the wallet looked like an overstuffed burrito. The deciding factor to rate this a four, not a three star minimalist wallet was the price. At the time of my review the wallet was listed for less than eight dollars, which is a really good price for a minimalist wallet.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,"Very soft and true to size, but very short."
4.0,"got this for my daughter, and she loved it"
4.0,"I'm 5'8 125lbs and normally wear a small (size 2). After reading reviews, I decided to size up to a medium since I purchased this as an airline outfit. I wanted it to be slightly roomy and comfortable for travel. The medium, though a little odd to figure out at first was the right decision. It's loose in alll of the right places but the drawstring is a little long, so I actually just cut it for aesthetic reasons. Overall, good buy. I would recommend for travel or as something quick to throw on for easy comfort."
4.0,Most comfortable that I’ve been able to find!
4.0,"This thing is pretty cute! The wings are a little funky but it was $16. The zipper has a double zipper on it, one ,upping from the top down and the second starts in the back and goes up the front! My guess is because it was made in China and many people there do not use diapers, you can unzip from the backfor baby to go potty without taking the whole thing off? I have a tall 6 month old at 28” and it is pretty long for her. We will just roll up the sleeves and legs and it will be fine."
4.0,These are solid and nice and comfortable. After long use feels a little tight. Blocks out sound really well. Impressed.
4.0,"I’m 5’9, 200lbs and usually wear a size 14. I bought an XL in black and it’s fit great. Super cute, hides my bra straps and doesn’t seem see through, decent material. Only negative is a personal preference; it’s a tad shorter than I like, it’s sits a couple inches above the my knee.  Will definitely be keeping this!"
4.0,I bought this hat to help protect me from the sun after laser eye surgery. I thought it would be just another hat but it's so cute!! The bow is a shade or two darker than the hat but it adds a little pizazz to the hat. Super cute!
4.0,My daughter wears these everyday at school. They have held up after washing everyday!
4.0,"Looks very cheap in person, but I added some black coloring into all the grooves and now it looks like a nice antique ring.<br /><br />The adjustable sizing is great and actually looks like a fitted ring when you're wearing it."
4.0,"Is absolutely georgeous, always get compliments when i wear it, but the fit is too large, order a small and have to send it tailored in order to fit"
4.0,"My granddaughters will be wearing these dresses to their Mommies wedding on the beach. They're super cute, lots of different colors, and with the mix of blues, they'll look great in the beach wedding pics. My youngest granddaughter is 1. I ordered the 1-2 yes. It fits, but it's a little longer on her than her sisters. It's ok tho because it looks adorable, and it fits around her midriff area, and with the ties on the shoulders, it can slide down anymore. I cant wait to see the pics. They were low cost, cute, and they can wear them more than for the one event. They'll be able to wear them next summer because they are just below the knee now, so next summer they'll fit just above the knee, and the top area is elastic,  so there's that. The necklaces that come with it are a hit too. Wooden beads, for a bohemian jive."
4.0,"Nice quality dress, length is good, I am 5’8 and it is down to floor as in photo.  Wish there was a bit of gather at waist like a similar dress I got as the vertical  stripe print across front would look better with a gentle gather rather than seen straight at waist seam."
4.0,"Nice bag for the price. I'm a Kate Spade fan but needed a new plain black purse. It's a nice size and fairly well made. There are a few details about the design and construction that you will notice are lacking if you regularly purchase higher priced bags. (A few poking out ends in the stitching where the thread was changed midway, the handles aren't edge-coated, the little detail on the handle hardware is slightly off place, the zippers aren't that smooth...) Those little things aside - it is a good size and will get the job done. I do like the pockets and that it has a zipper on top to close it. It came flat and needed to be &#34;reshaped&#34; a little. It did have a bit of an odor but I wouldn't say it was strong or off-putting. It is the same smell most items have after wrapped in plastic for a while. I'm sure I will over stuff it as I do with all my other handbags and it will need replacing sooner than usual but I would say it is a good buy!"
4.0,I liked the jeans material of the hat.
4.0,Needs space for thick things!!
4.0,Wore to a wedding & felt great in dress.
4.0,Very cute set! Only complaint is beautiful is spelled wrong on one of the charms.
4.0,Nice leather bracelet.
4.0,I enjoy these. Thought they would be smaller .
4.0,These are great fit for my Starfleet uniform and is easy to put on.
4.0,really nice and great sparkle- I have a small wrist so ordered it because of the size- great bracelet to travel with - no worries if it gets lost- great price too-
4.0,I gave this to my daughter she love purple it is dainty and looks really nice it said 925 but I just think it's the little tag on it but like I said for the price you can complain
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. A soft cami with an elastic shelf bra with no padding. I'm 5 feet, 115lbs, and 34B. I bought a large which is a little big, but it will probably shrink in the wash and fit fine."
4.0,"I first ordered the ankle heather grey ankle pants and I love them for work! They look so nice, are comfy, just the right amount of stretch. Then I came back and ordered the magenta ankle pants and to my surprise, the fabric is not the same. Way more Nylon than the grey ones I love. This gives them a very thin, flimsy feeling (although very soft) but you could literally see every lump on the back of my thighs. Super bummed 😞"
4.0,"So, I am between an XL and XXL.  A stretchy XL fits great.  These were a little tight.  So I will say they are a good XL.  Since they were a little small, I didn't really wear them, but they seem to be well made and have a bit of control."
4.0,"my kids love these, however, I would have liked to see a little more substantial material used for a hoodie. It is more like shirt material."
4.0,"I love the back of this, the color and the overall design. The only issue I have is that the straps are just a little too long so if I do any kind of moderate workout, my ladies start trying to creep out of the top of the bra. I like the longline look and this works well for cycling or some of my strength workouts but anything else is too much!"
4.0,"Shirt is super soft and a little bit thicker, like a thin sweatshirt.  It fits me perfectly, but I sized up because I was going for a flowy look like the model..I guess size up 2 or 3x to get the oversize look"
4.0,Very comfy. Too short for me. I returned it. 😢
4.0,"These masks are a mixed bag- literally.  As many other reviews have stated, the solid-colored masks are very large while the printed ones are smaller. After reading reviews before purchasing, I thought I would prefer the bigger, solid ones since I do not like masks that touch my mouth/cling to my face.  However, it turned out that the printed, smaller-sized masks fit me nicely and how I like masks to fit (roomy).  The solid-colored ones were too large for me.  I tied small loops at the end of their strings and they now fit me how I like.  One of the photos I included is of the loops I tied on the larger masks (near top corners of bag).  But I prefer the printed ones due to their softness.  The solid-colored masks are very stiff.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind if you are looking for extra protection, the printed masks may not be for you as they are a thinner material.<br /><br />The prints are cute and look the same as advertised in the photos!<br /><br />ETA: Photos were taken after washing and air-drying the masks."
4.0,The material is more like t-shirt
4.0,"Fit as expected, arrived on time and in good condition, would recommend, and will purchase again!!"
4.0,"This band is lovely, stylish without being gaudy. The latch is a magnet, which is great as it holds the Fitbit on my arm securely. The only bad part is that the magnet is exposed, which means it sticks to anything I rest my arm on that happens to be metal: food trays, utensils, even my laptop. It would be better if the outside of the magnet were shielded somehow. It's a minor annoyance..."
4.0,"Really amazing leggings, but they fit a little small."
4.0,"Beautifully made, just wish they shipped it better because of the crease down the front of the bonnet."
4.0,"For the price its a great shirt I've paired with khaki green jeans.  I wear with sleeves rolled up with the button sleeve holder.  Order up as the sizing is smaller - I wear an America Medium to Large.  I ordered the XL for a blousy easy fit.  I do have to cut off loose threads but this has now survived about 7 all white, hot water washings."
4.0,A little big for a kindergartener  but my son loves it.
4.0,It looks so cute but for me it doesn’t fit my neck on one size I might have to cute a hole between some to make it fit perfectly but that’s being a little picky ya know. I do recommend it like I said it’s ADORABLE
4.0,I love the harness and enjoy how well sewn the belts are I did not put five stars down though because my side snap holders were incorrect. One of the sides had a missing snap and I was upset because I looked through the packaging to see if it had simply fallen off but it appears it was never put on the product. The one snap that is on though is very strong and I am glad it can hold.
4.0,"Very stylish and a great leather band - thick and high quality.  Case is shinier/more reflective than photos display (neither good nor bad, just different).  Mechanism appears to work well, keep good time, button function as expected.  Only criticism is the numerals appear to be printed decals and look a little chincy."
4.0,"Love them! Exteremly large rings, but I love them none the less. I usually wear the rinds on a necklace chain with certain outfits. Recommended for those who don't mind a tad bit of off ness."
4.0,"Somewhat small, but I am going to work with it."
4.0,"First, the manufacturer's name appears prominently in glittering gold on the crown - somewhat detracting from the overall appearance.  I don't blame a manufacturer from wanting to advertise on its product but doing so a bit more modestly in this instance would have been preferred.<br /><br />The hat has quite a wide brim, and there is wire running through it so there is some measure of control over its shape.  However, given the size of the brim wind would influence that shape somewhat regardless of the desire of the wearer.  Still having that ability to at least influence the shape of the brim is helpful.<br /><br />The size can be modified with a tie on the outside of the hat so it can be snugged to the wearer's head.  Having lost hats in the wind I can say that is a useful feature.<br /><br />This is a very lightweight hat - we're experiencing a bit of a cool spell at the moment so not possible to verify this, but it should be comfortable in warmer weather.<br /><br />You may not win any fashion contests wearing this hat (although it's certainly not a bad looking hat) but it should help keep you cooler and more comfortable in sunny, hot weather, and the sun protection it provides could save you from skin damage caused by excessive sun exposure."
4.0,"This dress is great! It fit as expected, is form fitting but in a comfortable way due to the material of the dress. The design across the midsection is great to not only break up the pattern but also help flatter the waist and stomach. I recommend! I am 5ft 145lbs, length wise it hits right at my knees. Great for work which is why I bought it!"
4.0,It's a cute cover up. Does it look like the picture posted? Not quite. It is a little shorter than what is shown on the model. The fabric is nice though and it does fit me so I can't really complain. It's well-made. Looks like it'll hold up. You can still see my bathing suit underneath as welll<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"My son loved these for his birthday party. They were true to the pictures online. My only issue was that some of the strings on the hats popped off, but we just reattached with tape."
4.0,Fabric isn’t breathable but fits well
4.0,"I love the variety, colors, and quality. They go in easily, however they are a little too small. I work in a busy restaurant environment and they kept slipping out. I will be exchanging for the next size up."
4.0,Very dainty but if you are getting it for someone who doesn't like big and gaudy then this is nice.
4.0,The color was not white like advertised. It was more of a bone/off white color.
4.0,good for a light sock inside a slip-on shoe or boot
4.0,fits great and feels great for casual use will not recommend for work since  everytime I wear the band it opens with the movement of my hand because of the locking pins on the sides of the band
4.0,Nice shirt with a cool logo.
4.0,"Absolutely beautiful and a perfect size for a woman. They are made a little cheap though. The shell part actually popped out of the silver backing, but luckily we caught it. We just had to glue it back in, but it was disappointing to have that happen."
4.0,I had this blouse in red and loved that so much I decided to get other colors. It is really beautiful and I wear it under blazers for a professional look when I present. The pink is a bit see through but I wear a cami underneath anyway. Also go the blue and it is just gorgeous as well!!!!<br /><br /> They can even be used in winter (currently 30 degrees here) as long as you have a scarf to cover the neck area.<br /><br />They do come down a bit in the armpit area but I like this because I normally sweat  a lot but my pits stay dry because air can circulate! I will probably buy one in each color.
4.0,"Loved the style, fit a little tight .. would have returned only due to the fit, but didn't have time. very good quality and love the style would purchase again but order a size 1/2 or full size up."
4.0,Sizing chart is wrong according to my husband. The fingers chart he would've worn a S and palm a M. We ordered a LG could've used an extra large. The webbing area at fingers doesn't quite go down. Overall he loves the gloves!
4.0,Bigger than I expected.. but really cute wallet to store all my cards. It’s a little hard putting the cards in the slots but overall it holds everything.
4.0,Was used to play Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. Turned out pretty good. Delivery of the mask was prompt.
4.0,Nice and flowy. Nice purchase.
4.0,"love, has to be ironed and it fits small but the color is great."
4.0,"I like this shirt, I wish it would have been a little loser around the middle. It was tight around my waist which made it bulge at the top. The material is very nice and the cold shoulder looks good."
4.0,"Fun, comfortable dress!"
4.0,"I like it, is a bit small but will need to wear it without a bra so it can fit better!"
4.0,"Considering the price, I didn't expect it to be as pretty as it is.  I love everything peacock and this was far and away better than expected.  Would highly recommend it."
4.0,"Let me start by saying that I do not own any high end watches. I prefer to purchase lower priced Chinese automatics due to the fact that they can look great, and function well enough for my needs. That is exactly what this watch is... a cheap Chinese automatic that functions well.<br /><br />Now for the actual watch. I'm very happy with the face of the watch. It is crystal clear, very high end looking, and very functional. It works as intended and all of the dials have been precise. It keeps time well from day to day so far, and rarely requires me to wind it (I do wear it every day).<br /><br />The band is a piece of junk and I find it extremely hard to believe that there is any leather whatsoever in it. It's a plastic/vinyl feeling band and it's very stiff and cheap looking. I swapped it out for a nicer authentic leather band from another watch I had that had been damaged. Looks great now, and feels good on. I'm 6'2&#34; and just under 200 lbs, and this looks just right on my wrist. Not huge, not tiny, just right. The crown and other controls are placed well where they do not dig in, or even become noticeable even when bending my wrist. I would probably buy this again, but only for the face. The band will go directly into the garbage, just like the 1st one did."
4.0,great for cub scout emergency prep unit - perfect keychain pull
4.0,My husband likes that they're light weight. Found them for less in Marshall's.
4.0,"Very nice dress look exactly like the picture however it didn’t fit me, I am 5 feet10 and it was too  short for me, other than that it is definitely a nice evening dress."
4.0,Nice-looking item.  No idea if it blocks effectively; it looks and feels like normal material.
4.0,I am really enjoying this nightshirt.  It is warm without being too warm which the long sleeve & long nightshirts are.  It has become my favorite Winter nightshirt & is so comfortable.
4.0,"Fit perfectly. Comfortable. There were a couple of spots that rubbed my foot on the inside  - it seemed like it was some type of glue residue - but after using a nail file on them lightly, the fit was perfect."
4.0,Larger hands might have trouble using the tiny screws
4.0,Very nice quality and appearance!
4.0,I have 1 out of 2. These are very comfortable just be careful not to snag it. It's pretty useless after that.
4.0,Love the color it's a pretty wine shade. The only thing I have a problem with is that it's a bit to short I prefer my dresses to barely not touch the ground and this ones like an inch or so from the ground. Love the material keeps you cool. Overall a very good product definitely would order another in a different color.
4.0,"I had bought this to wear over a couple of my tank tops because I don't really like my shoulders showing that much. It definitely is very comfy, but it's not as long as they make it look in the picture. Plus, it only comes in one size which was a bummer. Because of that, it's a bit small on me (not a lot but it's not quite as flowy as I wanted). Overall, I wouldn't buy it again, only because it doesn't quite fit they way I wanted it to. But if you are a thinner person, then it's a cute and comfy."
4.0,This is good and delivered as expected
4.0,"It is comfy but, my daughter is 10 years old and I got her the size, 11-12 and the straps were still a little too tight! Over all they were pretty good!"
4.0,"I have been using these glasses for bike riding for about 3 weeks now.<br />I ride in different light conditions sunny, cloudy, under elevated highway (Nimitz)<br />Pros: Good Construction.<br />  No obstructions to periferal view. A plus for street commuters.<br />  Removable sweat pad on brow.<br />  Comfortable does not fall off your face.<br />  Price for what you get.<br />Cons: The glasses are not dark enough for ridding into the sun.<br />  They take awhile to darken and will not darken if shaded.<br />I don't know how scratch resistant the lenses are, hopefully I don't find out too soon.<br />Thanks,"
4.0,Fits a little snug around elastic waist.  Over priced for the quality.
4.0,Super cute but seemed to run a little bit on the smaller size. Love the colors and the style.
4.0,I bought them for me but after I got them I gave them to my niece they look like plastic not that good of quality.
4.0,It's a really big locket
4.0,I was told that the Cortez model was perfect for big heads. Well not really. I wear a 7 7/8 size hat and these frames are a bit tight on the sides of my head. The optics of the lenses are incredible though!
4.0,It fits alittle big...but stil love it...
4.0,"The sizes run  a little small, but is a nice product for the price."
4.0,"This was a great low cost purchase for a Christmas gift. Our niece loved it! She’s a teen girl and put this on the second she opened it. The wrist/finger slots are quite stretchy. She’s a 13 year old with very petite hands and this fit her nicely. I put it on as well and it fit my hands without stretching it out on her either. For the price of it, it was a great purchase!"
4.0,Glasses wee fine.  A bit tight fitting.
4.0,"Really cute, nice quality. I think this would look good on almost anyone. I am short and curvy and I am paranoid it looks too short, but if you wear leggings it looks great."
4.0,I love this dress and am hoping to be down a few pounds soon to not need to order the larger size. I have broad shoulders and DDs so its pretty tight up top. The colors are vibrant and pretty! Its a soft fabric and super comfortable.
4.0,I would have exchanged this for an extra small if that was available. It’s a very pretty coat but it is not meant for petite people.
4.0,"I love the vibrant colors. There was a little squeeze trying to get the checkbook flaps into the holders, but overall it works! Exactly what I was looking for. Something simple to keep my checkbook from getting ruined in my purse."
4.0,I received the item on time...they run small but the design is nice
4.0,Comfortable. Seems to be wrinkle resistant.
4.0,I just needed bigger than a 3x.  Some shirts will work and others are too small…..  bummer.  Loved the shirt…. I’ll gift it to a friend
4.0,I love that It's fresh. The sleeves are a little bit more large than I like but It is okay. I like it anyway because the color and the fabric is so comfortable.
4.0,"This dress is very cute and I have gotten many compliments on it even when wearing a sweater over it at work. I am 5'3&#34; and the back of the dress is only a few inches off the ground, so if you're a lot shorter that could be an issue. It doesn't look as great on someone small chested as it does in the photo, but it's cute nevertheless. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because the straps undo easily if you touch them or move wrong. But I would still recommend this dress because it makes me feel confident wearing it."
4.0,"Good fit, good style, comfortable material. Starting to come apart a bit after the 2nd use likely from the Velcro on my elbow protection"
4.0,"Ordered my daughters size and they were very large, too large where they would not stay on her feet."
4.0,"Pretty good. Would only use this for packing clothes in. The straps are a bit thin with hardly any padding, but super convenient being able to pack the bag into itself."
4.0,"Likes:<br />- color (a bit sheer but typical for a white blouse)<br />- cut at collar<br />- length of blouse and sleeves (I am 5'3""); this is perfect to poke out under my blazer at the wrists and also to tuck into my dress pants<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- wrinkles BADLY.  Forget pulling this out of your suit case and wearing it.  You have to break out the iron.  :/<br />- on me, the front was a little too low cut, forcing me to worry if my bra was showing.  I'll sew it up to remedy but still (just about 1 cm probably)."
4.0,Loved this outfit. It fit great.
4.0,Used for the Thunderbirds air show.  Gate search went quickly.  Holds all I needed it to and more.
4.0,"I gave this bag 4 stars instead of 5 because it will snag your clothing. The blank side will catch on fabric, so be careful when holding it against you. Great bag, and even more beautiful in person and it comes in a pouch for storage."
4.0,My 16 yr old daughter loved it but it was sheer.
4.0,Very nice mug but a bit on the small size as far as capacity goes. Not terrible but I wish it was a little bigger.
4.0,Fits very well and nice material for being so inexpensive.  You would never know that I paid 9.99 for this suit.  It is a great value.  Note that the various colors have different backs.  The blue and turquoise is best as it does not have hooks like the white/pink/red.  That one has weird hooks that come undone easily.  I would not recommend that color!  But the blue and turquoise is a super value and definitely get it!
4.0,These are well made for being so cheap.
4.0,Super cute but they do run small.
4.0,"It's pretty much exactly what I expected.  Could have a little more weight to it, but that is just being picky.  Go USA!"
4.0,"I've only worn them twice, before washing them, so far. They do seem thin so I'm cautiously optimistic that my toes won't pop through after another wear, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do. But so far they seem to not slip off my heel and are indeed &#34;no show&#34; for the shoes I've worn them with. I'm pretty sure this has more to do with the shape of ones feet though."
4.0,"These fit ok, but very long on me.  Not bad for price."
4.0,i ordered L and returned for a Med still a tad loose. So I would say runs a lil big. But I haven't washed them so...My measures 29/30 waist 42/44hips
4.0,"I like it, however I wish I would have ordered a medium as the previous reviews suggested. I like it. I was trying to see what shoe works best the reason for two different shoes. Turned a lot of heads. Material is thick enough so you can't see through it."
4.0,Super cute top! It was a little more cropped than I wanted due too my bigger breasts (36DDD). But I would still recommend for cute workout gear!
4.0,Nice to have the availability for a replacement band. Sized as the original Garmin bands. Nice also for the lifetime replacement.
4.0,"I ordered the Wildyak Heated motorcycle gloves XL leather. I had issues with it not being warm enough and if you are looking for something that works in super low temps and produces very high heat, I would suggest a different model of glove.. Customer service is great with this company, they resolved my issue and sent me gloves that were warm enough for my application of riding bicycle and motorcycle."
4.0,"These remotes at first I thought didn’t work— but after really reading the instructions I realized I had to look and see what kind of receiver I had on my gate (had to remove the cover) flip the switch on the remote (inside a small cover) and then followed the instructions. Bought two remotes and both work great! They aren’t as well made as my original, but they were a good price. I got two for $20 compared to a replacement from Chamberlin for $40. I bought these as spares to have a backup and to give to our dog sitters."
4.0,I'm pleased with the quality and style of the earrings. They are small but exactly as I expected. I do find it a bit difficult to put them on because the part that goes through the ear is fairly short and curved.
4.0,"I've been using these gloves as a rake as I weed and clean up my yard.  After a record heatwave, parts of it were so very dry.  Even under such conditions, the gloves worked well to rake up the mess (see photos 1-3) which I would usually drag my regular garden gloves across until I wore out the fingertips of the gloves.  After the yard got watered again, I cleaned up more (see photo 4) and tried digging a little with them (see photo 5).  Digging was fairly easy, although I believe you would have to have quite soft, loose soil to dig deep.  The gloves held up well to some pretty hard work (see photo 6).  I would love to see a couple of changes to this set.  First, I would like to see them sell the gloves in at least two sizes because these are large on my hands and they would be far easier to use if they fit better.  Second, I would sell them in sets of two for the dominant hand... in my case, two right hands.  The left hand will hardly get used and the right will be overused.  Somewhere out there is a left hand gardener with the same problem!  Still, they are a great idea."
4.0,Was a bit too small but was still able to wear it
4.0,"This ring looks right like the picture. However! After wearing it for only a few days, it turned my finger green. It is a shame because I really like this ring."
4.0,"I wear a L with yoga pants so I figured a XXL would be fine. I expected them to run alittle small. I bought these in part of a mermaid costume. It doesnt go very high up in the back. It barely covers my butt.  You DEFINITELY need a long top. But, they are very pretty and shiny."
4.0,"Very cute, but it was still very small. My 18 month old Is pretty big so I got a 24mo size and it was still to small. I think this runs small. But then again, my baby is BIG"
4.0,"It’s really cute, the reason for only 4 stars is I was expecting like a bigger earring. It’s small and dainty other than that it’s really beautiful, and I love it."
4.0,"This dress was very pretty in person. Word of advice though, if you have ANY type of belly and would like your stomach area to be smooth, be prepared to wear some spanx and not the high-rise ones bc they'll show. I am 5'7 and weigh 183 lbs and I ordered the XL. I am working on my stomach area so it wasn't as smooth of a look as I would have wanted, but it wasn't bad at all. I just have a slight case of OCD and I'm very hard on myself, so I'm very cautious as to what I wear so I don't look fat. And that has nothing to do with the dress, that's just my own personal issue. The dress was EXACTLY as pictured. It was very comfortable, and the material was very soft. This dress is very appropriate for a date night or for a girls night out. Would definitely recommend for purchase."
4.0,Quality made. Love the pockets. Only downfall is they were too small. Definitely order up at least one size
4.0,"This unicorn hood is quite a magical piece to wear. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because the LED lights fade really fast. They only last for two hours before they seriously dim. By the end of the night, it was like the battery died. This is after inserting a new battery, too! It's a great piece to wear, but if you're expecting it to be lit all night, it may not be for you. I still recommend it because...who doesn't like unicorns?"
4.0,I thought it was cute but I had to return it because the bottoms didn't fit right on me. If you have a bigger bottom half this might work great.
4.0,"I got a large in the navy in this. It's a tad more loose than I prefer, and I think I'd have been happier with a medium. I'm going to toss it in the dryer and shrink it a bit since I don't want to send it back. The navy is a dark navy, darker than pictured. I'm probably going to order the teal too."
4.0,"haven't use yet, But looks good."
4.0,So far so good. My package arrived when expected.  The product washed up nicely and fit pretty good.
4.0,"I bought for my kids, and they are wayyy too big. The colors are bright and bold. Material is lightweight and stretchy."
4.0,"It is like the picture. However, seems really delicate."
4.0,A very well made bracelet. Love the design. Juat a little bit smaller than i expected. Over all a great bracelet.
4.0,used them on my new galaxy smart watch feels great seems strong.. i think i made a good buy
4.0,"I love the shirt, but I have this thing with t shirts that have “ bell sleeves” where the sleeve flairs out even with large arms. I’m going to have to have it tailored, but love it otherwise."
4.0,I received them early. I did receive a text. No email or update for Amazon that they had been delivered. They fit over my glasses perfect. I like them! I love my case to put them in. Frame is very fragil though which is why I did not give 5 stars. They fit over Perfect of my Rectangular Prescription Glasses. Thank you. I just need to be extra careful not to break them.
4.0,Lightweight and breezy. Fits as expected and color as expected as well.
4.0,"Arms are tight. Looks nice, but I'm afraid the material isn't gonna hold up."
4.0,"I like the sweater but it didn't fit the way I thought it would on the picture. I needed to buy it 2 times larger. I usually wear a size 6 small, and I order the next size up, and it doesn't hang loose the way I wear my sweaters."
4.0,"They run small. Nice colors, wash up well, no shrinkage that I've noticed."
4.0,It fits very nice I love it
4.0,This dress is lovely and well made. It looks expensive. It was packaged nicely. I am only returning it because the color was off for what we intended to use it for. I ordered the pale pink but it is more like a pale neon pink with a hint of peach. It was for my 8 year old who is on the small side and we ordered a size 4. It fit perfect everywhere but wasn't floor length. It was more tea length/mid calf length on her and she really wanted floor length.
4.0,"I really like these bracelets. I wear with my mantra band bracelets, which are also stainless steel. I swim often and hate removing all of my jewelry. I plan on getting another set of them in the near future."
4.0,"These boots are super cute and I love the design. They fit as expected, I wear a size 6 and they fit perfectly. They keep my feet dry and the hems of my pants from getting wet in the rain. Only downside is trying to stuff jeans into the top when you wear them, they bunch up at the top. But besides that would definitely recommend."
4.0,"This bracelet was advertised as a men's bracelet, but I am female and I bought it and really like it. I am able to wrap it around my wrist three times. It is a simple, slightly-edgy bracelet that has become one of my fashion staples. The only down side is that it seems like the holes are gradually becoming stretched and will probably eventually not fasten well."
4.0,"The ""jeans"" are pretty enough but quite roomy. They also have a ton of spandex and stretch.....a lot! So, if your into very stretchy, cute jeans'ish these are the ones for you. They don't have rips and tears so they were what I needed. But, too much stretch for my taste so I won't be purchasing these again."
4.0,It fits perfectly but it's very fragile. There's no way to fix it but take it to the jeweler. There should at least be a back up.
4.0,"Pretty earrings. Good quality for the price. Wear them all day.  Look genuine.  Only problem I that the earring backs are tight ,"
4.0,Good simple product. Safe and easy to use. Keeps my cards secure.
4.0,I’m 5’2” and I weight 163 lbs. I had a csection last year and I have not lost my baby belly yet(or much weight either) so I love that these pants hug my belly and offer support. I DONT like that they run small. I ordered medium(I usually wear size 8 in jeans or M in most pants/shorts) but the medium I received were more like an extra small(I put them side to side with some extra small ones I have). The sports bra in medium fits great(I’m wearing it in the picture).<br /><br />I ended up buying another pair in a size large and those leggings are what I’m wearing on the picture. The large sports bra was way too big.<br /><br />I did measure myself prior to purchasing and based on their size chart a medium should have fit both top and bottom but it’s way off on the bottom. Good material and decent quality. I do recommend you size up.<br /><br />I personally will keep my medium because I am actively trying to lose the weight I gained during my pregnancy and I know I will lose it and I love having clothes be my prize(previously a size 2).
4.0,"They fit nicely, just wish there came more than 4 in a pack."
4.0,"I think these boots are great for a casual day.  They are very comfortable, but not meant for a long day of walking."
4.0,My daughters love these outfits for tumble and cheer classes!
4.0,"Decent strap, quality questionable."
4.0,"Just fine for a Gilligan's Island theme party - but the Captain actually wore a dark hat, not a white one, on that TV show.I wear a large hat and this one fit on the last adjustment tab."
4.0,"This shirt also washes well and does not shrink. The color is true to the picture and looks nice. Fits well. Will be good for frequent wear,"
4.0,"Fits,well, true to size. But the red looks orange to me, which is disappointing since i wanted it for valentine's day"
4.0,"Nice sweatshirt, wish it was a little longer. My only issue is, I didnt get the color I ordered."
4.0,Beautiful purse for the price :)
4.0,loved the bracelet but it tarnished easily
4.0,"A bit too small and warm for me, but my girlfriend likes it. Doesn't really stretch at all. I reccommend a size up if you can."
4.0,This outfit was adorable on my daughter. It fit her nicely
4.0,Nice...but run a little big.
4.0,"Cool, just a keychain, not much to review but eh."
4.0,"Very sexy body con dress, i bought it for lingerie"
4.0,"I had to order 2 sizes up for it to fit. However they did mention they are bridal store sizes which is how I knew to order 2 sizes up, unsure why they run so small. I am normally a size 6, I ordered a size 10. It is a beautiful dress for the price. Runs VERY long. I am 5'2 and even with the highest heels possible i would trip on it."
4.0,"As simple as the tittle says, it looks fancy, the Shine its pretty good for not being real gold, its also delicate, so use it gently, for this price you can actually use it with gold combination clothes, my girlfriend love it so much.<br /><br />Recommended =)"
4.0,Perfect size to handle and does a great job!
4.0,Nice band and very sporty.
4.0,I have had these bras for almost a year. I threw out all my wired bras.  I'm not busty. I use them mostly I place of undershirts wear cleavage would otherwise show or slightly shear shirts.  Would be great if they sold them in a pack of single colors.
4.0,"The cheapest gmt on Amazon and automatic too. It runs and wears well. Not an exact replica of the Batman GMT per proportions and aluminum bezel; bracelet has hollow but well fitting endlinks with extended mid link; after removing all links, it only sizes down to 7"" wrist and not sure if you can use microadjust in clasp as I'm afraid to pull out easy link extender as would be required, but I like the bracelet as it's lightweight and closes securely; also had to lube rotating bezel with trimmer oil per YouTube hack but works fine now and lines up. The pearl gmt movement works well in this watch but had issue with same movement in a different brand so I may have gotten lucky. It hacks, hand winds and has unidirectional rotor, running at 21600 bph. There is no screw down crown but it makes operation of the movement easier. The case is plated alloy and not stainless but looks good, though can scratch (seen after I removed the bracelet). Lume is better than expected. Overall I'm pleased to have it and find myself wearing it often."
4.0,Nothing amazing about it. Kinda small.
4.0,Ordered for my pregnant sister to wear to funeral. She said it fits nice but the yellow is sort of see through
4.0,Super warm and comfortable however the material at the bottom of the feet is very VERY thin. Feels like you are barefoot or standing on a napkin.
4.0,"Was a little big, but was still cute!"
4.0,"This is a great cable knit sweater. It has a standard cable knit pattern, tightly woven. It fits well--a little bulky, especially under a tight fitting coat--but it's so warm and cozy. It's a great sweater for a crisp fall day. It's fine for winter too, but, like I said, the material is thick and the sweater is a little bulky so it depends on how lose your top coat is. If you have a slim fitting winter coat, it would be a little snug. The black color makes it really versatile. I love it with tapered jeans and riding boots. Maybe a nice scarf if it's particularly chilly out.<br /><br />I generally try to avoid washing and machine drying sweaters to make them last longer and to avoid pilling so i can't really comment on that. So far mine is in fine shape, but I haven't put it to a tough test via the washing machine or dryer yet."
4.0,"Arrived earlier than expected, which is always a plus in my book! The hat is a little more floppy than what I wanted, but it works since it's a pretty good price for what you're paying for."
4.0,"I bought these the same time that I bought the capris. Like the capris, the material is super soft and feels great. They fit as I expected and look great on. Very comfy! Glad I bought these at the same time. Like the capris, I will add a star depending on how they wash up long term and whether they fall apart in a short period of time or last a while."
4.0,"I like the print, wish the material wasn’t quite so sheer but it works!"
4.0,"The custom was so cheap material. After I was dressing foren1 half hour everything start braking it.  The upper level of the custom, the zipper etcetera."
4.0,"Nicely made, I like the button trim. Looks like they will stay up, but won't be road tested until the weather turns."
4.0,"shirt is awesome although a little on the snug side. I usually wear a size large with tshirts because I like them having a little room and not feeling like I'm wearing spandex. This shirt is a little tight but not to the point of it being super uncomfortable. that being said, this is the perfect Zelda shirt for a true fan that has followed the series from the start"
4.0,Kids loved them. Good product.
4.0,The top is a little to short for a toddler. But cute pants !
4.0,"I really like this cardigan, but it's definitely not perfect. I'm 5'5&#34; and currently weigh 145lbs. I got it as I just had a baby and thought it would be great for breastfeeding and would still look good when I lost the baby weight. It's a bit baggier than I'd anticipated but the sleeves don't go all the way to my wrists. I'm keeping this size as I don't want the wrists to be even shorter and it does work very well for breastfeeding. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase for the price."
4.0,Very nice for the price the bracelet  not vey flexable
4.0,"The Kosy Komfort Men’s Low Cut No Shoe Athletic socks are well-designed, well-constructed and thin.<br /><br />The cotton socks have grips at two locations – there is an elastic grip at the front of the sock that secures around your forefoot (just behind the ball of the foot) and there is an inner heel grip that prevents the sock from slipping off even during active sports.<br /><br />These Kosy’s do have some cushion but are a little thinner than Bombas or Converse socks. The socks do not cover the entire top of the foot and it might be an issue for some.<br /><br />They have held up to multiple wearing and washes without fraying. The elastane and grips are still working well. Make sure these are hand washed or machine washed on the delicate cycle.<br /><br />Recommended."
4.0,"Love it , it is very pretty as a day dress"
4.0,"I love the look and they have loosened a little bit, but they still rub the top of my foot.  Not my most comfortable pair of Vans."
4.0,"I've worn these for years - love them.  They're so easy.  Walk into a dark store, just pop them up on your head.  Great for hiking as they help keep the wind and side glare out.  4 stars because I think they could somehow be made more attractive.  They tend to look a bit like cataract glasses.  Function over style..."
4.0,"So I got this top for a wedding that u haven't been to yet. But I tried it on and it's so pretty, but it's a bit flimsy and it's not that long. But overall the top is very nice I like it."
4.0,"Very nice sexy red nightwear... I simply love this piece. It runs so small, it says for Xs to med.  but it is really xxs... So if you order it, you might want to go bigger.  I am 120 and find it to be smaller than expected.  But it works out, just snug.  It is beautiful and nicely made.  My hubby loves this nighty and kept complementing me on it.  I felt great wearing it and very sexy.  I have small breast and it fitted well in that area.  The bottom is a nice length and is well made. It also comes with thongs to add to the romance of this nighty.  This product is as decribed and is beautiful.  I recommend it and find you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Item was purchased with a promotion for free in exchange for testing and giving my honest unbiased opinion of this product. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review I hope you found my review helpful. Thank you."
4.0,Traps all your pee inside. Feels wonderful.
4.0,This dress is amazing but it was too large and I had to return it.  Might order in smaller size but it won't get here in time for my event tomorrow.  Beautiful peach color has a Pink hue to it which I love!  I'm 5'3&#34; 155 and the large was too big (maybe I read the measurements wrong).
4.0,"I enjoyed the logo on the hat, it fits well."
4.0,"Is a bit wide, but looks much better in person than i expected."
4.0,They don't fit mine.  Also the spring is too strong and almost bent my frames.<br />I'm puzzled why almost all clip-ons are polarized?  Ever try to pay for parking at a meter with polarized lenses?  Not easy.
4.0,Wonderful to keep photos of loved ones close.
4.0,"Love the band. I love the little ribs it has, seems to give it a bit of a different look. This material does seem to hold on to dirt a bit though."
4.0,"Received the product very quickly. The straps we weak, so I added a second set which made it much better. The mask was slightly annoying, resting on the upper lip, but definitely tolerable. Half-masks are the best!"
4.0,Order my son a size 8 because he wears an 8.5 but he has a narrow foot. Well these fit more true to size. The 8 wasn’t too small just for him to have slippers for the house. I wear a size 7 in men’s and the shoe fits me perfectly (no extra space) so depends on the fit you want
4.0,Cute purse great size for my 6 yr old not as thick of a material as I expected very thin but over all good for a girl who is always changing purses
4.0,Grandson loved it. Fits well.
4.0,"Some of the tulle on a few of the socks were sewn crooked, so the tulle was sideways whenever the socks are straight. But a few pairs came out okay and they will be beautiful in our spring photoshoot."
4.0,I wish they had a petite option. The legs are a bit long but l make do. The color is more of a pastel Easter-ish green. Definitely not &#34;jade&#34;. There's a little pocket on the left front side of the pants which is convenient.
4.0,Their great!
4.0,Sizes are small bit my granddaughter looked so cute in this outfit and is comfortable for her to wear!
4.0,you can’t beat it for the price
4.0,"Cute but the top runs a little small. I'm a 36D. Pants are a good length and width.. I'm 5'7"""
4.0,Fit my 8 and 11 YO boys well. Not too tight but tight enough to stay in place
4.0,"The pockets are a bit hard to get into in a hurry. I wish it had one back pocket, or a cargo pocket somewhere."
4.0,I had wished that that velcro straps were a little  longer so it could wrap around and hold better.  Other than that it's fine.
4.0,"I loved this watch band when i first received it, however now it's starting to turn and doesn't stay tight on my wrist anymore."
4.0,Product came as described.  They do not keep you updated on shipping very well.
4.0,Not a bad top but really keeps you warm
4.0,"Love the style and got compliments on the shoes from both women and men but they fit so small. I usually wear 11 and they fit perfectly but these fit like a 9 1/2-10. Because of the small sizing my feet start to get uncomfortable and start hurting so I try not to wear them for extended periods of time, but I still very much like the quality and style."
4.0,I don't know about durability yet. By the measurements this is somewhat small. I can wear it but it's not very comfy. I don't usually buy clothes online but these colors are really nice. Maybe I will just lose weight! Ha Ha.
4.0,"The socks definitely control foot odor and wick sweat at least as well, if not better, than wool.  They're comfortable if a little thick, but not hot. The only caveat is they aren't nearly as durable as wool or other synthetic materials.  They get ""pilly"" after a couple washes and last me about 6-8 months per pair. I still find them worth it for their performance alone."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7566ee042f0c427c54277467a3e28953]] I just got these today and instantly fell in love with them. If you are constantly on your phone, laptop, etc you should definitely invest in them. As soon as I put them on I saw a HUGE difference."
4.0,decent quality. you can slide the ears into the position you want. there's little bells on the bows that i didn't notice when I ordered but my daughter likes that she jingles when moving her head
4.0,Nice quality and color watch bands. Very easy to install on watch.
4.0,"It took a little getting use to the release mechanism, but it is so much more comfortable that the standard belt style!!"
4.0,order up a size
4.0,It’s super cute but I got mine too big. It either runs big or I’m not as fat as I thought lol.  I wanted this to fit perfect and be on the skimpy side like summer shorts but once again not sure if it’s the cut or the size.  I may shorten it myself tho not planning on returning it cuz I’m lazy
4.0,It is cute and looks fancy although it does look a little smaller than the picture shows
4.0,The bag set is perfect for traveling. Mesh keeps clothes fresh. The different size bags fit well together in all my luggage. Only complaint is the zippers could be better. You have to be careful when opening/closing since they jam easily so 4 stars.
4.0,"I get so many compliments on this pendant.  It is somewhat large, but it suits me just fine.  The blue on the body scratches off if not careful.  I guess it is just painted on.  I love the look of this piece."
4.0,I liked the hat tho it was bought for my son.. l.o.l
4.0,"Same color , fit perfectly on my body .:)"
4.0,I ordered this in a large but wish I had gotten the medium. It is very generously sized. The fabric is quite thin but provides a little cover from the sun and/or for modesty over a swimsuit. The white details are printed on and not embroidered.
4.0,I'm tall and these are way to long. Needed to shorten.
4.0,"Nice jacket, I had gotten one for my daughter and liked how warm it was yet lightweight. This particular jacket ran a little small and that is why the 4 stars. Highly recommend jacket for something warm yet easy to pack!"
4.0,"Based on prior reviews ordered one size larger than n.ormal, and fits perfectly"
4.0,WAS FINE
4.0,I bought a size 28 and it fits like my 27s
4.0,It is a very cute skirt plan on wearing it today. Just what I was looking for!!
4.0,Missing one undie!!<br />Though the underwear are super cute and stretchy I was missing an underwear I received 11 instead of 12 and it was the one with all the koala print. Mistakes happen I guess 😩
4.0,"Fit as expected. Great material, stretchy and provided great coverage. This gave me the professional put together look that we were going for. Very pleased!"
4.0,These are large pasties...but pretty 😍<br />Good quality.
4.0,"I am 5'4"" and 170lbs.  I usually wear a 12-14 so I ordered the Large.  It's way too big.  It comes just below my knee and looks like I'm wearing my grandma's moo moo.  I love the fabric texture and print so I will be exchanging it for a medium."
4.0,"Nice leather, but a bit thick. maybe better for 24mm or upper models."
4.0,"Excellent quality, but runs a bit small.  If you want it tight, buy your normal size.  Otherwise, buy a size up."
4.0,Thought I'd be able to notice a little more colour
4.0,very nice a little small.
4.0,"comfortable, wear with any top. pockets a little small"
4.0,cute dress and fits well
4.0,"Very cute jacket for the price!  As other reviewers have commented it runs small.  I ordered a large because of the reviews and it fits just fine.  For reference, I am 5'6&quot;, 135 lbs and 32DD.  Excuse the wrinkles in the photo.  I am sure the jacket will iron up nicely.  Just so you know, the material is thin, no lining and there is no washing instructions.  Other than that, I'm glad I purchased it.  Super cute!"
4.0,"Was cute but had to return as it was way too large, for reference I bought a small and I’m 5ft 115lbs"
4.0,Made a big difference!
4.0,The look and feel of the beanie is nice.  The cap fits a little shallow.
4.0,"Burgundy is much darker than pictured, but nice comfy fit. True to size."
4.0,"It's a good top that can go good with multiple choices of bottoms, I enjoy this top"
4.0,"The Ferbia Women’s Oversized Half-Zip Sweater is a cute addition to your wardrobe for casual, everyday wear.  It fits just as I expected it to— not overly baggy, just loose and slouchy as described. However, I have to admit I was a little confused upon trying it on as the sweater is described in its promo material as a “hoodie.” Though the neck is a nice zip cowl, there’s definitely no attached hood. And because the design of the zipper in the cowl neck allows you the  flexibility to adjust the sweater’s look depending on personal choices for styling and warmth, I don’t miss the hoodie. But I did believe it was important to mention regarding advertising.  The promo text also says that the sweater is very soft, but for me that’s a question of how the word “soft“ is used. If it’s used regarding the weave of the sweater being fine enough to drape and hang well, then I agree. but if it’s used with respect to being in direct contact with skin, I personally found it a little too scratchy. At its current price point, I also feel like it’s at the upper end of what I would expect to pay for a similar product. Ultimately, if all these aspects are considered and it meets your needs, then I believe you’d be satisfied."
4.0,Came with everything you need to pierce however be aware that the needles are a little bit small so if youre new to piercing it can be a little difficult
4.0,A tad small
4.0,". Somewhat disappointed in the fabric, but it is a cute piece. Fit as expected."
4.0,"The top fits perfect, my pants were a bit snug but the suit is really nice. I am a satisfied customer."
4.0,"I truly wish they had more of these leggings in an xs. I got a small and they fit a bit looser then expected.<br />I ordered these to compare to NVGTN and I can honestly say; they are almost identical!<br />Although the lighter colors aren’t squat proof, this light grey color passes a squat test for sure!! I love these leggings!"
4.0,Fit great... Hand gets hot quickly
4.0,"I was looking for some jewelry for a friend's birthday, and I found this one right away. My friend and her husband don't have kids but have had five dogs in the 15+ years they've been together, two of the five have since passed. Each dog was named after a moon in our solar system (Luna, Phobos, Titan, etc). I wanted to find her something she could wear often to keep her puppies close to her heart, so a moon with a heart and dog paws is absolutely perfect. She loves it!<br />The necklace itself was a little too short, so I had to buy a longer chain, which was no big deal."
4.0,"Based on other reviews I got a medium. Im 5&#34;1, 120lbs, 32B. While it does fit im afraid it will shrink. Wish i would have gone with my better judgement and ordered a large. I do believe the item fits as a medium normally would though just not as some reviews stated for me."
4.0,"The magnets on these are very strong, so they rub and rub and rub and create large scabs in the nose. The other types stay pretty nice and look pretty good."
4.0,A little confusing on top to do the crossover thing. But overall good suit with nice slimming ruching
4.0,"I love how comfortable the material is, great to wear around the house, thick enough to wear around friends and family. I wish I would of received the short sleeve shirt though since it's too hot to wear this one too long."
4.0,Very nice random scarfs
4.0,"Nice quality shirt. The sleeves are a little longer than the average polo shirt, but besides that it's perfect. Great price for a good product. I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"Overall I really enjoy the product, however the color is more of a navy blue rather than being black which was disappointing."
4.0,"I liked these glasses very much especially because bifocal lenses are difficult to find in any store.  However, I left them in the car for a few days and the arm on the frame broke.  Possibly too much heat."
4.0,I reviewed the comments and saw how everyone was suggesting a size up. I'm 5'5 138 pounds and I ordered a large when I would usually go for a medium in swimwear. Very nice look. I didn't get in the water with it though. The top could be bigger and also your butt cheeks will hang out if you got a fat bum lol. I'm a 34 D and 40 in the hips . . .
4.0,"They look good, are sturdy and provide a nice, clear view."
4.0,"The necklace is cute and dainty, but at first look it looks like a princess crown, not a lotus flower."
4.0,Loved this dress! Very comfy and light weight! hugged the right places and was very flattering with my hair up and down!
4.0,"Yes you will need to file down the sides, not too much but a little it's not a perfect fit. You don't have to file it down but you need some serious strength to install it and to remove it. It's honestly not a big deal and if you have a small wrist this will slip right off. Good for medium to larger wrist sizes. Super comfortable and worth every penny. It's super easy to use and remove, I know it's not in description but you can soak and wash and I like that. Buy it!!!"
4.0,Happy I ordered a size up. It fit perfectly on my son.
4.0,This beach cover up is so soft and beautiful. I absolutely love the style and color is exactly what's in the photo. This is primarily a cover up however I use it as a scarf. The primary reason why I could not give it more stars is because as a cover up it is too small for me. It doesn't cover up anything. Maybe because I'm tall or a big woman but it's not a good look for me and it disappointed me in that aspect. However the fact that I can use it as a scarf with an all black romper...i have no problems with it. I love the color and the quality of this product. I definitely recommend this product to others. I was selected to receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion
4.0,"Small spots on it, but pretty color and good quality."
4.0,Product fits.
4.0,"We are a very Halloweeny house, but this may have graduated from that season to an all around wearable!"
4.0,Very pretty can't wait for a special occasion to wear it
4.0,"Didn’t realize it was mesh (as if a swimsuit cover up set) when ordering the 2 piece outfit, but it’s still cute tho."
4.0,"Can wear as is. Dress it up with lite sweater, cute sandals be good for party, church, wedding etc."
4.0,My granddaughter loved it. It had all the different competition categories that she competes in. The only bracelet I found like it. I wish there was one that was higher quality even if a little more expensive. For the price it was good.
4.0,This watch band was exactly as represented.  Take great care removing the old band--You don't want to either break or lose the pins as the new one does not come with replacement pins.
4.0,Runs very small. Tight for a skinny 7 year old. great graphics.
4.0,"It runs about a size up, but very good quality, rugged and great discounted price as well."
4.0,Not perfect but.. it helps on my enduro motorcycle riding. Helps a lot. I just use the strap on the top the others are not elastic and are too tie.
4.0,"Jacket is made from a decent material, heavy and comfortable.  Sizing is bigger and actual."
4.0,"the fabric is a little stiff and immediately turns me off. The waistband has some give, and Sizing is true.<br /><br /> I’m 5’8” 132lbs wearing normal Size: small.<br /><br />You could see dark undergarments, but the dress is opaque. The colors are Rich and overall design is flattering.<br /><br />I love this for a casual summer dress, it just feels like a cheap Dress."
4.0,These socks are a nice pattern and comfortable to wear. they make for cute socks to wear on warmer days or when you need something more dressy. The toe is a bit baggy on my feet and I'm a shoe size 8.5 women.
4.0,great fit and makes my clothes look so much better
4.0,Sleeves a little short
4.0,"I absolutely love this bathing suit, it fits my daughter perfectly"
4.0,"Good fabric, good style, good color."
4.0,Returning because the largest wide calf size wasn’t wide enough for my son’s big calves.
4.0,These are cool & moisture wicking. Lightweight & perfect for Florida summers.
4.0,great dress for my daughter. Washed up very nicely.
4.0,"I bought this because I had previously purchased the khaki colored one several years ago - which I LOVED and received so many compliments on, it even caused many coworkers to go and buy their own bag.<br />This is almost exactly the same as that one, some changes have been made.  The main straps are now shorter than what they were on my old bag, but I think because I'm short, it doesn't make that much difference and still fits over my shoulder without having to use the longer strap.  The pockets in the front are deeper than my old bag, so that is a plus!"
4.0,Luv it fits perfectly
4.0,"Nice suit, great colors!"
4.0,Super cute love the color a lot of compliments would have gave it a five just wish that I have been a little bigger
4.0,"I am 5 feet.  order XL, I am a petite 14 it was .way to long .if you are taller ,order this it is a great dress . I returned it becauseit was not worth it for me to  send it out for alterations."
4.0,"It`s a fine wallet. For me though, it`s just about a half inch too wide, not thick but wide. All in all, it is a well made and high quality wallet."
4.0,El material no era lo q esperaba
4.0,Bought this for my wife. She likes Alexis Bittar and this was consistent with what I expected and she was happy. Only reason for 4 stars is that imho this stuff is incredibly overpriced for what you are purchasing and the cost of production (even with an allowance for compensating the artist).
4.0,"Advantages:<br />It does its job, I would recommend using it.<br />Works with 32GB USB Flash.<br />It supports FAT32 and exFAT file systems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does not support the NTFS file system.<br />FAT32 has a file size limit of 4GB.<br />Audio 3.5mm jack doesn't seem to be working.<br />It is a mono device, no stereo audio.<br /><br />Very Big Cons: When rebooted sound level drops to default (I would prefer if it could save the volume level).<br /><br />Overall very good value for money."
4.0,5'2 115lbs I ordered a small fit more like a medium. Still cute though
4.0,Overall pretty good. Some small scratches but no big deal.
4.0,The description of the bag states it has a zippered back pocket. The one I received does not. I believe this one is an older model without The zipper
4.0,Nice for the price...but not as shiny as they proclaim to be.
4.0,Nice quality. 5 is for awesome
4.0,"I expected them to be somewhat small so I ordered a size bigger, those fit just right but I wanted a little big so they'd last a little longer. My son loves them though."
4.0,"Beautiful skirt it's too small in the waste and even wearing it just under my bust, there's a puddle of fabric on the floor but I am going to try to alter it myself. Still absolutely worth buying but definitely go up a size!"
4.0,"The cami is really nice and the fit is as expected. Its really smooth and feels good quality. I purchased the champagne color, and the 1 star less is for the color. Unlike the picture, its more of a peachy coral color. I expected the blush color as in the picture. But otherwise, pleased with the purchase and it arrived faster than mentioned delivery date."
4.0,It's blue but I like it
4.0,"Great Product, but it tends to get stuck early in the months."
4.0,May end up having to replace the string but I love it!
4.0,A little lighter and longer than expected but overall nice pants
4.0,"it runs small size its cute nice snug fit good, ok cushion"
4.0,Inexpensive but does the job.  Cute for a 1920's themed party.
4.0,I liked that it could be for a teenager to adult size
4.0,"I am 6’2 and about 285, I’ve bought a couple other XXL stringers and like them. I bought a 3 pack of these, and they are a little tight, but not too much so. They are a better length than one other I had bought.<br /><br />Edit 6 weeks later, I’ve washed them several times, they’ve gotten softer than my original review. Also haven’t shrunk much if at all."
4.0,Super cute size up
4.0,Got these for my mother for xmas. There sturdy and beautiful. She seems to b enjoying them. Sure worth the price
4.0,My grandsons love these shoes. They are really cute and I have bought them 3 times over the  last 2 summers for 1 grandson and twice for the other. They get 4 stars because they don't hold up for the whole summer. But the kids love them so much I bought them anyway.
4.0,"I bought a large for the extra room and it’s a little snug, I probably should’ve gotten a XL; I typically wear a medium."
4.0,Not as comfortable as the Dawgs brand that I’ve purshased in several colors for years. The Z style . Telic brand is a slightly different fit but for the price I’m satisfied.
4.0,"I have my own so I know they work.  It arrived quickly, seems to be well-made, but wherever I look, I find them to be over-priced."
4.0,"It is versatile, and okay color."
4.0,It is a great boot but it was advertised as black and was really dark brown.
4.0,The quality of the Keychain is good. Doesn't look cheap.
4.0,"Very nice watch band for a ladies apple watch. Its a little difficult to size, to do so requires the removal of pins that hold the band together. The band come with a useless pin pusher that will promptly break when any force is applied to it.  I used a small jewelry pin punch to remove the pins and complete the sizing. One of the best features of this band is that it uses a clip to remove the slack from the band. Should the clip possibly snag up against something or open up you will not loose the watch,  it will simply become loose on your wrist.<br /><br />My wife absolutely loves it."
4.0,"Looks nice but it was a bit big, I purchased a large because of previous reviews, I am 5'7&#34; and 156 pounds and a M would have actually been good for me. It is also somewhat see through. I like the stripes, color and overall look."
4.0,Nothing to complain...best value for a fair price !
4.0,"Not super absorbent. It is lightweight as described, but could definitely be softer."
4.0,These really show off my wife's assets. I enjoy our workout time even more then ever since I got her these!
4.0,no shelves
4.0,"Mostly does what it's supposed to do.  Nice material, not to heavy nor to thin. I just wish it was a little longer in the back to cover my bag that is on the back of my chair."
4.0,"I reordered this top in a Large (normally I'm a small) and it's still a lot smaller than I was expecting it to be. It's still very pretty and I will wear it, though I would have liked it to be a little more off the shoulder like in the photo."
4.0,The pink isn’t as vibrant as it appeared. Super cute though
4.0,Daughter really likes the bag and received a compliment on the first day she used it. Unfortunately the included caribiner broke the same day. Luckily we have a spare one. The bag pattern is really cool. I would order again.
4.0,"Quick shipment. And product is everything as described.  My 16 year old daughter stole them from me, so I will have to order some more."
4.0,Slightly shorter than I expected. Material is a little stiff. Over all fits and looks great.
4.0,"It has a thin feel to it, works well in the summer so I'll wear it thought it was cotton as seen above but is not"
4.0,"I bought it for my daughter because of the color - this is her favorite. But in reality color is not so vibrant and bright. The shirt is still ok, the material and look is good enough. Overall, my daughter likes this shirt."
4.0,FIts well & is cute!
4.0,"We tried many skirts (for my daughter's prom), and this one was the nicest looking.  The waistband was nicely finished, the fabric was smooth and not cheap looking."
4.0,"I am 5,6 and 145 lb. I ordered M and it is a truly nice fit. Not too tight and not baggy.  Rocked my zumba class in it. 5++++"
4.0,This cute little clutch for a night out on the town.
4.0,she love them and they looked great! great for a wedding
4.0,fits wdll...a satisfied customer
4.0,Comfortable because it’s really soft and flowy. Only issue is the thinness of the material.
4.0,"This dress is cute...but I wouldn't call it a dress lol. For reference I am 5'5, a size 14, and 190 lbs.  I ordered the grey in XL and it fit everywhere but the length was very short. I lifted my arms up and my underwear were exposed. I was hoping to be able to wear this as a dress but I'll have to wear it as a tunic with leggings. The material is a thicker chiffon/crepe and it is lined so you aren't able to see through it (at least in the grey color). I love the lace trim at the bottom! Just be aware that this is too short to wear as a dress for someone taller than at least 5'3 (in my opinion). And it came with the necklace in the picture, which I wasn't expecting!"
4.0,The clean-cut style is flattering. The quality is decent for the price.  I usually wear size 12.  Ordered a 3XL based on other reviews.  Turned out it's just the right size for me.  This vest runs small.
4.0,"Followed measurements, but still smallish--- but great cut and color"
4.0,"They are okay for reading but do not work well for me while working on the computer. Its like the lower focal part is just not in the right place for my eyes and when I look up, the line between the two strengths is smack in the middle.<br />They do seem well made and I'll keep them as spares."
4.0,Beautiful dress just a little too long for my 5 year old
4.0,Looks just like the picture. The top fits kinda small
4.0,I really like it the but dont like the chain but that was an easy fix i took the chain from my other wallet and put it on other than that its great and roomy and durable.
4.0,I ordered these for my daughter in a size 8 and they were a tiny bit to small. She complained that they hurt her heel when she walked and they were tight around the toes. Besides being a little small they were well made and very nice boots. We returned these for a replacement with no issues.
4.0,These are nice glasses for the most part. They are a little big for big but should fit a man. They are very light and feel on the cheaper side because of it but they seem to be great quality. I wear sunglasses all the time and have gone through so many. It comes with a case and a cloth to clean them. The lenses are light. They don't turn everything blue or turn everything very dark.<br />*disclaimer* I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. This is my personal experience and opinion on this product.
4.0,You can’t go wrong with the price and quality
4.0,Love the top and color combination. Lightweight so not too heavy or hot. Only thing I don't like is that it easily snags.
4.0,"Fingertips are kind of awkward, due to insulating liner.  Worth it for the warmth.  Highly recommend. 🥓"
4.0,"These work well but if you have to use them on your child's pants daily I suggest you buy a multiple pack as, having to be made from elastic, they stretch out so they do not hold up the pants as well after not much use.  They are nice,though, as we have received a lot of hand-me-down jeans that my son would not have been able to wear due to them falling down."
4.0,The bag is good quality however I didn’t expect it was so little. I thought it was bigger.
4.0,"Love the watch but wasn't crazy about the watch band, it is easily replaced with a 22mm NATO or ZULU strap."
4.0,Nice gift. Kinda small. But good for you if u did phd during pandemic. I'm sure many had studies held up or done remotely during it
4.0,Feels cheaply made and is thin but appropriate for the price.
4.0,I have Leiden factor and either for these type of holes from the foot to the knee or take Coumadin which I don’t want to take. My internist suggested taking medication for the rest of my life. This support hose seems to do the trick.
4.0,"Took awhile to get here because its from China. However, I knew that ahead of time so no big deal.  Also, one faux pearl was not attached.  Again, I knew exactly what I was getting.  It will work perfectly on my dress."
4.0,The wallet is solid. I like the carbon fiber look. It has enough space in it for those with few cards and the bill fold holds a few bulls without losing its slim look. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the ID slot is difficult to deal with when pulling your ID out. Had my ID in there for a few days and had to take it out and it stuck like it was taped in there. Other than that....great wallet.
4.0,Ran just a tiny bit small.  But the fabric feels so soft!! Love this sweater!
4.0,Several kinks in the chain but very pretty and packaged to protect charms from scratching in shipping
4.0,I use these during work since I stare at a computer all day. The lenses are clear but there is definitely a yellow tint that becomes visible when looking through them which I assume means it’s doing the job of filtering the blue light. They are light and the frames definitely creak but they haven’t broken yet.  The lenses don’t seem to clean very well but overall they work fine. Solid if you want a cheap pair that will work.
4.0,Keeps good time; stem somewhat difficult to pull out.
4.0,It worked great for Halloween costume
4.0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size up.  I wish I did not because they are big and the waist is high.  I am keeping them because the length is great!  The quality is great, the color is so pretty and I like the high waist when working out.  When I buy a second pair I'll order one size down then my true size.  I hope this helps someone!"
4.0,Fits good. May roll up a little if you wear it a long time. Good for working out in.
4.0,"My boobs look AMAZING! Beautiful shape, No spill over, very supportive and keeps shape all day. Fabric could be softer and I’m not convinced it will last forever, but for the price, I’m thrilled!"
4.0,I like this shirt but need to exchange for a smaller size. It definitely runs big. I am usually a medium but a small in this shirt
4.0,Just what I expected. As beautiful as the picture. Only issue was I ordered 2 sets & one came as expected other came 2 weeks after. Recommend this product
4.0,"I love that it came just in time for the anime con I'm going to &#60;3<br />I bought the navy blue version of this. I'd have to say that I absolutely love this product, the entire piece felt well made and that it wasn't rushed. I do have to say measure yourself 3-4 times in inches AND cm just to be absolutely accurate (especially with the top) since there's no zipper/button on the top; you have to slip it over your head. Not sure if they do custom sizes, but if they do I would recommend ordering a custom made since I'm under 5ft tall and I'm a bit thick so the sleeves cover almost all my fingers (but it makes me look cute so I'm okay with that). Overall it's a great buy, might buy the black version at a later date if anything. Also a heads up that the material is made from a thicker fabric so no worries about it falling apart as easily as say a normal halloween costume."
4.0,Overall comfortable and easy to care for (not hand wash like many store bought items these days). Cute casual dress for day or evening wear. My wife is a teacher and she can wear this comfortably to work due to the length of the dress. Would recommend!
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" and it fits me well. I tried multiple aprons with this style and this one fits the best, not too long or short, straps are the perfect length, and the bodice is more fitted than the others I tried. The pocket tore on this one the first time I wore it, but it's otherwise perfect so I'm exchanging for a new one. The material isn't the most durable, definitely reserve for lighter wear."
4.0,I love this shirt on the weekends 💕. Looks cute with joggers!
4.0,Is a bit rigid and some cards are hard to get out until you work it in some. Was struggling to take out business cards to hand to a client. Nice size compared to my old one. Only one cash pocket.
4.0,"Being in a sunny desert climate, having sunglasses is a must have. And if you are actively outside a lot, such as biking, golfing, running, and such, then having one that interchanges a variety of lenses is even better.<br /><br />This one gives you 5 different types of interchangeable lenses:<br />Colorful lens: Will give you a clear natural sight even in the rain and will block out UV rays (this one comes already assembled on the frame)<br />Gray polarized lens: blocks UV rays and reduce glare<br />Yellow polarized lens: Improves visibility in dim light & reduces glare, especially helpful when driving<br />Blue lens: Improves your eye sight in air pollution or foggy weather<br />Transparent lens: anti-fogging<br /><br />The frame is very easy to disassemble and reassemble to change out the lenses. The nose piece is comfy as well as on the ears too. They look stylish and having the wind shields on the sides are excellent for biking. The reason for deducting a star is the size is rather wide / large and do not fit my face very well. They fit a little better on my husband but not by much. They do however fit my dad and my brothers very well and all of them are asking me if they can have them. I think I may have found a great birthday/Christmas/fathers day gifts for them.<br /><br />I received the HODGSON Cycling Polarized Sunglasses for Men or Women, at a discount or for free in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. All opinions are solely my own."
4.0,"Gets lots of attention. Having to get used to the buckling mechanism a little but not a serious problem. Great delivery, great product so far!"
4.0,The quality of the material is great and size is prefect<br />The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is it needs to have an inside pocket
4.0,"I usually have terrible luck with pants fitting, but these are perfect! They fit just as I have hoped and are definitely better than my other pair of high waisted jeans. And also these are skinny jeans, they're not so skinny that they pull themselves down my butt, like another pair I have.<br /><br />I took off one star because after just a few says of casual wear, a thread came undone and caused two parts to separate at the waistband. It didn't make the pants fall apart and I can fix it with a quick go on my sewing machine though so I'm not too upset."
4.0,Cute gift for a girl who loved it.
4.0,"It is thin and cheap, stretchy fabric with a scratchy tag, and it was relatively inexpensive. Half of the bats look weird, like buggy demons. Would buy again, both the same dress and also from the seller. Good shipping time."
4.0,Relaxing at home
4.0,The dress is very cute but was to big on me. I felt like I was drowning in it. The material was a little stiff. However it was really cute and made well.
4.0,decent watch
4.0,"The outfit is super cute!  The top is very boxy, but flatteringly so.  The shorts are super cute and comfy.  The only problem is that the straps on the top are adjustable (yay!) but the plastic piece that adjusts them is incredibly sharp.  I don’t feel safe resting with something so sharp next to my neck."
4.0,Not airport metal detector friendly.  Although it is fairly easy to detach the buckle from the belt before you go through the metal detector.<br /><br />I'd like to see one of these that are airport friendly.
4.0,You can wear as a slipper or outdoor shoe
4.0,"Tokyo Ghoul Shoes. These are narrow if not 1/2 a size smaller than posted. I am a size 11 and I will not be able to wear them. However, I bought them to display anyway so I was prepared to accept them if they didn't fit. They are a great price and fairly good quality."
4.0,"I really like this headband! I feel like it's a little bit warm for working out, but it is wonderful for winter time & keeping my ears and head warm.  I have very short hair and wasn't sure how it would look. My hair is a little too short to pull back into a ponytail, however that is one of the reasons I love this headband so much. It works perfectly to hold my hair in place and look stylish as well.<br /><br /> I received this headband at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review, which is exactly what I have provided here."
4.0,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Super cute necklace and she loved it
4.0,"These are okay. I got the blue and grey 2 pack and they fit nice. These reported having tummy control, however, I took a few photos in these and that is not the case. It's obvious, so do not look for much support in that area, as these do not have any tummy control/coverage. You will definitely notice. However the plus side is they do not rise or fall, which is a good thing, especially when working out. The material does have a stretch to it, they are extremely lightweight, and they are quick drying. I could not tell if they were see-through, often times, that is obvious upon putting them on- so for now- they are fine. I got a medium, I'm about 150lbs, and 5'5. I would have sized down, as they are not as form fitting as I would prefer. For a 2 pack at the current price $11.99, these are affordable and will do. If I order again, I will size down."
4.0,Super cute and my almost 2yo LOVES his &#34;new shoes&#34; and requests them over other shoes. However they are not the best quality (canvas) but should last till her grows out of them. Can't expect much more for the price.
4.0,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the color. It was not black like the picture. It was more of a grayish color. Besides that material was nice an breathable. My kid still loved it
4.0,The site said a medium fit women's sizes 5.5-7.5. I wear a 6.5 and my toes hit the front of the slipper when I'm walking. They're very cute and very warm though; am trying to stretch them out and will keep them.
4.0,"They’re cute, the only thing I’d change is the chain with the feather on it is too long. I just fixed it myself with pliers lol"
4.0,"This is a great shirt for swimming. Not thin like other shirts. Dries fast.  My only issue is that I ordered a large and exchanged it twice, and was sent a medium all 3 times. I gave up and kept one, since I needed it soon. Maybe Amazon need to look at the labels closer."
4.0,Cozy fall sweater. Great deal. Took awhile to get it.
4.0,"I really like this ring. It is my new favorite. It is beautiful and well made, as sturdy as I hoped from reading other reviews, which were mixed. Because it is adjustable, it will move if you are carrying say, bags of heavy groceries and smooshing your fingers together. But it is definitely not flimsy. I would recommend this product."
4.0,Mine didnt come with the belt.  Should that have been included?
4.0,"Didn’t look like the model but it was close enough, I would recommend using the ties and tie in back"
4.0,My step daughter absolutely loved these shoes! They’re very glittery and adorable and fit her nicely (we got a size 9M). Highly recommend for a wedding shoe or even something for dress up.
4.0,This is great for weight loss if you're doing intense workouts. The fit runs a bit small but its better so it can fit snug during workouts. Overall great to have!
4.0,"Non-binding, fit as expected.  Fabric is thin, has held up to date."
4.0,"So far no problems as with the clips, satisfied."
4.0,Bought for my friend who is a huge Philly sports fan. Plenty of variety in the questions - covers all Philly sports from very old to very recent. Great purchase!
4.0,lock works well does not lock up like some other vendor
4.0,This dress fits really well and looks super cute on. One thing I didn't notice in the picture but now looking back I see it. There is a seem that goes down the center of the dress on the skirt portion. It is not a big deal for me because I am using it as a Halloween costume but if I wanted it for a nice event I wouldn't use it. Other than that I think the dress is fabulous.
4.0,"This little label maker is great.  I love how I can create labels on my phone through the app with so many different fonts, borders, and icons."
4.0,I bought this for a friend and I know she will love it.  It is nice for a very inexpensive piece for jewelry
4.0,"The shoe is beautiful, same as the picture but it’s a little uncomfortable to wear especially for long periods of time.<br />PS I had come back and make an edit to my review. Although the shoe is lovely, it’s of low quality. I just wore it for the second time and the sole is already having dents on it, as you can see in the photo I attached. It’s not durable and definitely not worth the money."
4.0,This works whenever I work out and add sweet sweat on my stomach area. I sweat a lot. I also like it more secure than most that tend to need to be adjusted from time to tone.
4.0,Simpy elegant. fit as expected.
4.0,Decent fit and very strong material. 4 months of Airsoft play on a weekly basis and no issues whatsoever.
4.0,Love the color and details
4.0,"These are very comfortable. They cover very well. I add a layer of protection, just because. Would be better with nose clasp or some sort of way to secure the top.  They are my new “go to” masks."
4.0,"I really like this sweatshirt! Nice fit, comfy and nice quality. I got the gray with the pink on top and I think it’s really cute. I got my normal size L and it fit perfectly."
4.0,"Waaay bigger than expected and very loose. Otherwise, quality is great and they’re comfortable."
4.0,"Little tight across the shoulders, but I'm a little built up from swimming. Good late summer/early spring suit."
4.0,It is a nice watch BUT the wristband is very stiff and hard to use. It takes a while for the wristband to be broken in. Otherwise a good watch.
4.0,Not bad at all well worth the price fine pair giving the sunglasses 4.5 stars ⭐️
4.0,Received many compliments on this ring. I've washed my hands countless times with the ring on and nonetheless it still shines. Friends and family alike have been trying to steal this ring. I would order from Vibrille again.
4.0,"These are really pretty and work nicely with a pair of flats I have. However, while these feel comfortably snug at first, they seem to hurt my toes if worn for an extended period of time (probably because my shoe size is 10-11). Also, if worn by themselves (slipper-style, as some reviewers noted), they slip off my heel."
4.0,5'1.. 157.. 36DDD<br />Short and curvy..<br />This Fit as expected and also the top is cute with a pair of jeans.<br />**I buy an item based on how it fits on body types simular to mine so thats what i look for when reading reviews.**
4.0,Looks cute on. Adjustable
4.0,"I love this earring, very pretty."
4.0,Love it but it already chipped.
4.0,It's a little bigger than I wanted. But it makes a great Christmas gift
4.0,"Such a cute shirt, my daughter loves to wear it! It has so many colors she can choose to wear many different colors of leggings or jeans to go with it, which I love because she's 3 and likes to dress herself, and change it up a bit, several times a day!! Only gave it 4 stars though because the little bow came off after the first washing, was glued on, so I just used a couple safety pins and pinned it back on. That actually made it work even better for her because we can switch out bows if we want to...right up my little girls alley!"
4.0,"Good for me as a university instructor.  When I retired, it was the first item I got rid of.  LOL.  worth the money ---"
4.0,"Cool little bag . This was my first man purse/sling/boy bag etc.. I’ve moved on to tacticle shoulder and chest slings these days... good-starter for your first murse,"
4.0,I purchased the white color.<br />Pros: Price was great for 12. Soft cotton and thick cotton terry towel like material. These are great for sports. Shipping was very fast and would order more in a pinch.<br />Cons: A few of the headbands had black spots on the white when I received them. After inspection I noticed that black cotton somehow got woven into the material when made. There was one that was very noticeable and couldn't use or get the black out. The other with the<br />black I was able to remove the black string without damaging because it was not woven deep into the other material.<br />1 out of 12 bad headbands for this price though isn't too bad and got my moneys worth. Since I ordered white I am  sure that is why the black showed up so prominent.<br />Fortunately I only needed 10 so I had 2 extra and the others weren't a big deal.  If you need 12 good headbands you may need to by 2 packs of 12 to make sure you get all 12 good ones you need.
4.0,"I like the color, the fabric and the price.  No complaints."
4.0,"My husband loves his new watch. This was the first mechanical watch that either of us has owned and the instructions that came with the watch were confusing and full of technical jargon. We figured out how to wind it and it keeps great time, I just wish the instructions were more clear to an average person."
4.0,"Not going to be what you expect of an original Luminox band but functional. Smelled terrible( like body odor) for the first day or two until body wash and several showers. The band is actually pretty hard to get through the loops and takes some fiddling. At first, I thought this was moderately annoying but soon realized that once the tail is in place IT STAYS. If you've owned a Luminox you know the struggle of trying to keep the watch tail in the last loop. This band solves that problem."
4.0,"Great set, loved the variety."
4.0,My daughter absolutely loved these glitter ankle boots! They are super cute! The reason for only 4 stars is we have only had them for less than a month and they already have some spots of glitter missing. So they look worn. But she still loved them and will continue to wear them.
4.0,"I like these bands, they are easy to work with.  The are comfortable and fit my wrist well.  With the band tucking up under the watch I don't catch it on every thing."
4.0,Looks good on the wrist. Suggest stacking with other cuffs
4.0,"This dress is super cute and flattering! One thing to note is that the crimson is definitely more of a bright red. It wasn’t what I was expecting, but it’s still very cute."
4.0,surprised that they fit my somewhat wide foot. Look quality built.
4.0,"I love LOVE this necklace! The only reason I took a star off is that the silver is wearing off and I have only had it a short time. Otherwise, absolutely beautiful!"
4.0,Needed to start wearing hats because of melanoma. Liked the style and the Amazon price. I wear it daily at home in the yard and covers well. Well worth the money.
4.0,Very nice Tory Burch tote for the price. It's very well made and easy to clean. It's a great buy!
4.0,"It's very cute.  Looks just like the photo. True size was small but got the medium cause we were afraid it might be tight. So it loosely fit. If you're small get the small, it's true to size. Over all it's a beautiful costume."
4.0,Fits just right..
4.0,"I love this scarf, it is exactly as described."
4.0,"Beautiful watch!  Very elegant in appearance, yet perfect for everyday use.  Face is just a bit longer than I expected, even though I was aware of the dimensions."
4.0,"I really like the way it fit. A little bit snug on top, but after trying it on several times on different days, kind of made it stretch a little."
4.0,"Not today did it fit right. It's close but I have not gained weight and this sucker should fit a little big (ordered size larger). I'm not sure what material it's made of but it feels ""waxy."" It's a decent size for the artwork and overall, I like it. I really wanted to LOVE it but, hey, shopping online can be tricky (esp with sizing)."
4.0,"Super comfy and soft, great beach coverup."
4.0,"Love this item.  I wish the pin was much smaller - unless you pin it through several layers and a broad area it flops around a lot.  I bought diamond glaze glue to place. this.<br /><br />The measurements are a little big.  I couldn't figure out how to get tot he software, so I followed the mm sizing that was recommended.<br /><br />TIP:  Do not place the glue on the picture.  Put it on the glass then place that down and do not pick it up again or move it around.  The picture will tear very easily if you apply the glue directly, or if you apply too much.  I printed the picture 3 times because of this."
4.0,Most hats are too large for my head but having the string inside the hat to size it is ingenious I don't know why it hasn't been thought of before I love the hat
4.0,These were a big hit with all the members of our family! Grown ups and kids/teens all loved them! I wish I had bought more! The sound quaility was surprisingly great!
4.0,cute and the color was bright...I like it.
4.0,"The watch is good and keeping time alright, but the band is too short."
4.0,"Great glasses. Putting these things on for the first time on a bright Phoenix day was quite an experience. The dim of this glasses is just different than any other pare of sunglasses I've owned. The dim is minimal, but the clarity of the light that enters your eyes is amazing.<br /><br />I would have rated them a 5 star item for it not my only complain. I've owned my pair for over 2 years now. And have noticed that she matte shading these glasses stand out for is fading away. I used to bare be able to see through the front of the glasses. Now the shading just isnt the same. While the glasses are still in good condition, the sleek matte shading that makes the glasses stand out has faded about 35 to 45%. While still happy with the product, a $250 pair of glasses should lose their signature look."
4.0,Colorful fun and got lots of compliments
4.0,The small was a CV little big on me but otherwise a lovely top
4.0,"Nice case I can see it protecting my phone but as the other buyer stated it's hard to put on with a glass screen protector that fits to the edge of your phone. Kept lifting my protector up while trying to put it on, hard to fit protector under edge of case because it's a such a tight fit. It took so long getting on correctly I forgot to remove the inside plastic which is definitely visible from the back. Maybe when I get tired of looking at it I'll take it back off. I recommend putting a little heat on it (blow dryer, etc.) to make it temporarily more flexible."
4.0,"Very comfortable to wear.  Nothing was binding; no tight waist.  Dress length was not too short for a 70 year old lady, but I did wear tights with the dress.  Long sleeves were just  right in length and fit.  I was able to iron out the packing wrinkles without any problems.  I was a hostess at a home for the Christmas Tour of Homes and received many compliments.  And, you can’t beat the price."
4.0,A bit itchy but it was good for the event.
4.0,Eunina make great jeans - I just wish they were a bit more low rise - other than that they are perfect
4.0,Cute swimsuit and she's worn it twice and it's been washed twice on gentle and low heat tumble dried and is holding up. It does look like it could easily get torn if not careful and modest wise is on the thin side not see through but too thin.
4.0,Like them just have to make sure you get is tight around your head when tieing.
4.0,Fits True to Size. Recommend sewing in a snap or wearing a tank underneath
4.0,Sold these at a music festival. They sold great and nobody had any complaints.
4.0,The underwear are fine. It comes in the same zip lock bag that dealers ship drugs in
4.0,"These comfortably fit an adult male. They are a bit loose on an adult woman and a ten year old daughter. I have to fold it over to make it feel like it’s not going to slide off my face. It is way too loose for an eight year old. We are tying to use them as masks. They are nice looking, and match the picture exactly. They are single layered but you can double it up."
4.0,"Well worth the money.  It’s definitely made well, but it’s not super high quality or anything.  Put another way, it will last great for an all day/evening for a Halloween party, but it’s not nice enough to buy for a more serious outfit (though, to be fair, I can’t imagine what a serious tutu outfit might be.)"
4.0,"I loved the material. I would have given five stars if had lace on the sleeves instead of double sided liner material throughout. I thought it was little bulky on the arms. Overall, it’s one of my cutest dress. The neck line lace is my favorite part!  I may removing the double liner from the sleeve length and restitch it. I recommend it for fall or winter."
4.0,"This red hot wrap-top dress is sexy! I would have posted pictures but, the top just does not cover me well. The material is stretchy and looks good. It feels good on the skin. I'm 5'8"" 190lbs 38D. It is a size Large and does not cover 38D well. Overall, it is sexy and short! I love that it has long sleeves and they are the right length. The middle has a strap around and I was not sure how that was to be tied. It is a cute dress. Just need to get the top on right."
4.0,"Love this, but don’t expect high quality. Some of the stitching arrived coming undone. Since they don’t have my size any longer I’ll have to take it to get it fixed up since I really like the style."
4.0,Great costume but one problem the mask tore when putting on
4.0,i think this ring was a really good purhase. it came in a little blue drawstring bag (which i thought was nice). the picture does lead you to think that it's bigger than it actually is but with my skinny fingers it looks fine. i love it!
4.0,Very Happy with it
4.0,Great warm hat!
4.0,I LIKED PRICE.
4.0,"These run small, get a size up from your measurements, especially if you do a lot of hiking/clambering up rocks when fishing."
4.0,"Always great quality, and good fit."
4.0,Son brought these as gift for his dad .
4.0,Only thing that I was dissatisfied with was the strap clasp broke after the first time I wore them. Other than that they are a perfect fit and very to the extreme comfortable
4.0,It is a nice color and design. The style is very loose and big so I'm going to fix it ;). I bought small size.
4.0,"The fabric and make of these was great, though they fit me a little awkwardly. I returned because of the awkward fit, but they seemed sturdy and well made."
4.0,very comfortable and I like it overall.
4.0,Great watch for the price and it serves it's purpose for my needs.
4.0,"If you thought this necklace is purple, you are wrong. Still like it though."
4.0,Pockets.  Stretchy fit.  But green color faded after a few washes
4.0,"Je ne pouvais en passer, ces cufflinks sont beaux et très simples comme nous (les hommes) les veulent. Je les portes souvent et ils sont très beaux.<br />Cadeaux pour lui... ces coffins le fera."
4.0,"I received this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review. I ordered this item on October 5th and received it on October 10th.<br /><br />***** Delivery took 4 business days<br />***** Well folded and packaged in plastic bag<br />***** Lightweight super breathable cotton linen material<br />***** Perfect for play/ lounge pants or dress up<br /><br />Although the item description said they would be shipped out of China and would take 15-25 days to arrive, it arrived in 4 business days. I live in a warm climate year round so decided to order this 2 pack flower pants for my almost 4 year old daughter. She's on the smaller side so we ordered 3-4T. Now I can see why a few reviewers said these run very narrow. I definitely suggest sizing up especially if your little one is still in diapers. The material being cotton linen, it has little to no stretch. The waist and ankles are both banded so the length would not be an issue. I appreciate that the material is breathable, meaning even with full length, your little one will stay cool and well hydrated in these pants. I also like the ruffle details on the waist. Overall, it's great value for the price and these will be a great addition to their wardrobe for spring, summer and all the way up to fall."
4.0,Runs a little small.  Still cute colors.  The length is a bit shorter.  Order a size or two up.  It’s soft and comfortable so overall I’m pretty pleased.
4.0,Nice but the material started to ruin on the first wear.
4.0,"The quality and color on this dress was really pretty.  I'm 5'6&#34; at 180lbs and ordered a Large, the length was great but my boobs were pulling the buttons open.  The arms bands just below the elbow don't stretch and it felt too tight.  I returned because of this but if I ordered again I'd go with the XL instead."
4.0,"This is a really pretty feminine dress. It makes you feel pretty as soon as you put it on. I'm 5'5 3/4 inches tall and the length was perfect with my black heels.it fit well and felt comfortable. The gown part of the dress flowed nicely and the sleeve length was perfect. I liked the material and pattern. My only wish is that the pattern covered more of the bust, instead of just one side. The stark white showed some lines underneath that were hard to hide without the pattern. Overall, very nice. This dress is a beautiful date dress with a little bit of sheer sexy on top, but overall just really pretty."
4.0,"Nice product.  There was some confusion on the shipping and arrival date, but it arrived as specified in the listing, so I was happy."
4.0,Good product all as promised.
4.0,"This was used as a gift bag for a gift I put together for a tech fan friend of mine. The quality wasn’t the best and it was a bit plain but overall with some tissue paper and gifts set in it, it looked great."
4.0,"I've guy  recently Got several of the nightgowns , Different brands cuts and material. I like this one. It's warm, the maeterail is heavy. The buttons are secure and the lace trim stands out. Kind of block Cut,, but that's ok its for lounging. I wanted it slightly roomy cause id got cool here father.<br />The colors are deep. I've liked all I got"
4.0,"Ok so too help anyone out who is considering buying these pants, they fit great. I bought the med.in these. The quality is good ..am using it for treadmill workouts..am 5.2 in height. Bout 150 lb medium built. ..it looked very small when I received them but when I tried them on it fit great ..it stretches out to fit your body..it wud buy more in the future. ."
4.0,"Fits really well, item is as described and the price is affordable compared to in store price for same product"
4.0,it's a tie and it looks really well and feels pretty nice.
4.0,No problems so far and they are surprisingly sturdy for the price
4.0,Perfect fit will definitely be using this next year
4.0,PRETTY PIN FOR FEBRUARY
4.0,The dress is super cute but I'm super disappointed it didn't have pockets. I was specifically looking for dresses with pockets and the title is very misleading. It's a very lightweight material but not see through.
4.0,"I love the way it looks and it is so comfy! The only complaint I have is the back ripped on my first hour of wearing it. I will be able to sew it up, but just be wary!"
4.0,Runs small consider 2 sizes up
4.0,"I liked it, but it was too big and just didn't fit me right. :( It was nice though!!!"
4.0,"this was a hit at my house bought it for the wife, inexpensive, matches the logo for our local high school, just a tad big for the regular Pandora bracelet, you need a stop on each side, only thing stopped me from giving it an absolute perfect."
4.0,I don't like the hammock. Material was nice
4.0,"Snug fit.<br />Phone didn't flop around while running.<br />Difficult to put phone in the pocket, if the phone is larger (I have the galaxy s10+) or if the phone case is rubber or grips the material."
4.0,I receive compliments everyday I wear this top
4.0,Purchased for my daughter and she loves it!! Very comfortable
4.0,"The strap has no &#34;give&#34;, so as you walk it sort of pulls on your feet. After a couple of hours, you will notice a mark on your feet from the strap. But i also notice it is a bit big. I normally wear 8, but this 8 is a bit long. So i don't know if a smaller size would help with the strap issue? But for the arch support, great."
4.0,"Really nice chain, shines, and gets lots of compliments!"
4.0,Bought these for my 7 month 20 pound  grandson.<br />Quality of the product was good.  Fit as expected.
4.0,Does everything it claims. The only real downside is that they are cut WAAAAAAYYYY too short.  My gentleman's sausage and bits wanna slip out after too much movement.  The leg &#34;sleeves&#34; also rise up making things worse.  Overall good for around the house or for a quick trip somewhere.  They feel great and are really soft and last quite well after a few washes.
4.0,"Really pretty. Exactly as it shows in the photo. It’s a bit stiff when tying a knot, but I think it will get better the more I wear it."
4.0,"Mask is nice and pretty, but the feathers fall off easily"
4.0,Great dress for the money! You won't be disappointed.
4.0,Cute would of gave it 5 stars but the packaging was very cheaply done
4.0,Look good with most!
4.0,"Great earrings, as described."
4.0,"That's really saying something for my daughter who isn't happy in anything besides New Balance XW and Crocs. She has a very broad foot with a high instep. The buckle is very stiff so it would be hard for a young kid, and the glue looks a little sloppy. We'll see how they last, but she is happily sprinting around in them. I'm just so pleased to find a dress shoe this wide, and the skeleton print is just delightful for my non-girlie 8 year old girl."
4.0,Very happy with this purchase.  Cute and fits well.
4.0,"Nice keep sake, but details of the ring are a little sloppy as expected."
4.0,"This is a nice seemingly well made belt.  It is real leather!  The one I got is black, with brown natural color, underside. Most hide leathers start brown, folks.  It is very comfortable and feels like it will last.  The buckle is nice, &amp; who cares what it says, my husband is the only one who sees it close enough to read it.  It does run a little small, but fits him fine with the holes it has.  It gets a four star for that reason, and the cost is a little high for a belt, in my opinion.  My husband likes it better than the ones you can get for about $15, at many stores. Not sure how I feel about the over lap holder being loose.  My husband tossed it anyway, as the belt fits him without much overlap.  The width is correct, for what my husband likes.  It does not twist, it stays in place.  It comes nicely packaged, in a gift box, &amp; the belt itself is sheeted in plastic, making it nice for a gift.  Mine didn't come with the hole punch, but we didn't need it.  Overall a very nice belt!  I received this free or at a discount for my unbiased opinion.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01D306C00 West Leathers Men's Leather Belt 100% Genuine Leather Belts Size 44 Black]]"
4.0,"Nice Material, fits as expected, cute style.  I always like the clothes from Allegra K. High quality<br />You won't be disappointed."
4.0,"they are cute and comfortable and are not see through!  HOWEVER, they dont stay up too well. its annoy to have to pull your pants up in the middle of squatting or running. Also the waist band is fold over with elastic, which doesn't stay folded very well."
4.0,"If you're looking for a better than mediocre coonskin hat to wear to a costume party... this one is perfect. If you have a large head, it probably won't fit you."
4.0,For the price these are pretty good. They're fun and cute! The quality is good for the price I wasn't expecting much. The color is bright and vibrant - pretty!  The gold part is a thin metal and the fringe part has held up well so far.
4.0,"I love this bracelet. I wear it all the time, in the shower, to bed etc. It's simple and elegant and seems fairly durable. I have ordered it more than once. The price is a bit high for me to pay for a bracelet but i really do like it."
4.0,Nice hat.  Not as sturdy as some hats I own.
4.0,"I didn't need padded anywhere, the bust area was too small."
4.0,"Really nice. But, it’s much bigger than I realized. I have a 20 pound Pom/chi, and it’s large.<br />Quality is very good. I recommend it for sure if you have a large dog, or be aware of it comes in smaller sizes."
4.0,"Belt is of good quality, reasonably soft and pliable. No cracks so far. Just be careful with its size when ordering. I wear size 36 pants, and ordered size 38 belt, as is usually done. The belt when arrived was two sizes too long (40), and I had to make  extra holes  in it. No big deal as I have proper tool for it."
4.0,"Nice, light weight scarf.  It looks just as it did in the photo.  Good scarf to throw on with anything."
4.0,The product is a bit different that another I ordered in a different color.  The disappointing feature are the ripples in the turtleneck.  It doesn't lay flat and close to the neck.  Overall it appears larger than the other mock turtleneck of the same brand.
4.0,"It is a little smaller than we expected.  But I honestly don't remember the sizes listed, if any.  It serves the purpose and she's happy that she finally has a &#34;dance&#34; bag.  It doesn't seem cheaply made, so for the price, I have NO complaints!  I would buy it again or give it as a gift."
4.0,small for the price
4.0,"My son likes these, but be aware that they are somewhat more purple than blue (therefore 4 and not 5 stars)."
4.0,this price? what else do you expect!!
4.0,I like this purse do the fact that it has enough pockets for the items I have and the color is great color. It just needs to be a bit bigger.
4.0,"The reason I gave 4 stars is because the pockets are too low, other than that I order a second one.  I wish the purple was available in my size."
4.0,"Es delicado, hermoso, pero un poco corto de la cadena."
4.0,Timeless
4.0,These are nice shoes. But the top is bulky for a person with slim feet.  They are high heels
4.0,"Nice, fits perfect."
4.0,"I got this for my 6 year old for Halloween, i red the reviews and thought I got her the right size and it was still too big, but she’s also in a weird size right now. It’s cute though and you can’t tell her she isn’t ghost spider😂"
4.0,"So cute and well made. It is very small. A wallet, keys, phone and glasses make it stuffed. It will barely zip. I need more space than us offered w/this purse."
4.0,"I love Solmates and usually get them every year for Christmas, but I feel like they are starting to change and not be as well made."
4.0,"I had to get new character shoes for a show, and the sizing on these was so confusing. I saw different reports of ""size up"" and ""size down"" by varying amounts, and decided to size up a half to full size. The shoe went on alright, but I definitely can't say it fit. I wish there were wide sizes as well!"
4.0,I usually take a Large in sweatshirts but this L was about a size too big. Liked it so I reordered in a Medium.
4.0,"Big enough for an adult or small enough for a child. I purchased this color and love it. I was skeptical about it fitting an adult  as well as a child but, it does.  My 3 y/o granddaughter tried it on and she likes it as well.  This kept my head warm during the frigid temperatures and recent blizzard."
4.0,These fit great.  But after a month they start to fade and lose their ability to stay up.
4.0,Much softer than I thought. Just the right amount of oversized-ness.
4.0,Super cute dress!!! I only wished that it was just a little longer! I’m 5ft 5 in  and it stops a few inches above my ankles. Other than that the fabric is soft and nice the color is perfect! The fit is amazing! I want more colors!
4.0,This is a quality saddle soap if you have a use for it and I recommend it to anyone having a use for it.
4.0,Got these as a gift for a friend.  They look pretty nice.  Hopefully they will fit him.
4.0,This is by far one of the best shoes out there for little toddlers running around.  My baby loves them and wears them everywhere.  The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star is because it gets dirty easily and wears out fast if you wear them a lot.  I think the full price it is a bit too expensive for something a child can probably wear for a couple of months.
4.0,"I'm normally a size small or extra small, but I ordered a medium because some reviews said to order a size up. Medium fit me well!"
4.0,Pretty nice. One of them kept ripping  open every time I sneezed LOL
4.0,"This is a BEAUTIFUL dress especially for a tropical getaway. I bought this for a trip to Mexico and loved it! The dress itself is VERY tight (almost like a spandex material), so if you have problem areas, make sure to buy a size up or wear some trusty Spanx! You can dress it up or down depending on your occasion. Overall, definitely satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"Received this quickly.  It is pretty, but quite small and I find that is doesn’t always lay straight because of the double chain.  I was going to return it, but it comes from China and the cost to return it was as much as the necklace.  Will definitely think twice about ordering a product that comes from China."
4.0,She love it very much
4.0,Nice material. Fits as expected
4.0,"Not great quality,  but for the price it did work as described...."
4.0,"Was a great find, love the fit and was very comfortable"
4.0,"Great jacket, love the reflective material, works great as a light jacket with removable lining.  Only issue is the hood, a bit big and doesn't fit so seemlesly into the jacket.  Also need to hold onto the lining so it doesn't get pulled into the jacket when you have it in."
4.0,This is a really lovely men’s watch. It came packaged in a nice gifty type box and the instructions to remove links were clear and easy to follow. My son was able to adjust the band size easily so it fits perfectly. The numbers are easy to see and the time is easy to read.
4.0,"So far so good, have used it a few times and it looks  good and seems to be of good quality"
4.0,Look good. As expected.
4.0,Shirt overall fits nicely but the cuffs are too rigid when trying to pull up on the arm. Cuffs need some elasticity.
4.0,"Fits perfectly, the material is not the best but goes according to the price."
4.0,I just got my finger lights and they were in 10 packages of four lights. So far the ones I opened work well and are bright. The finger band is like a thick rubber band that matches the light color and hold nice and snug. This is a very good value in my opinion! This would be about the quality of most dollar store type toys but at a lower cost. Using them for prizes at a birthday party. I would buy this product again.
4.0,"Great dress. Cute, comfortable. Reasonable price. Bought one for Christmas and for Halloween.<br />Fits as expected"
4.0,"Lightweight and fairly cute. Collar is a little annoying, but its great to throw on in a pinch. Vibrant colors. Pretty."
4.0,Great quality well built
4.0,Gorgeous jacket but I wish I had sized down one size.  This brand usually fits as expected but for me this piece was a tad to big.  I purchased an xl and should have gotten a large.
4.0,Soft fabric and cute shirt. I usually wear a large but decided to size down and it still fit pretty big.
4.0,"It worked for what I needed it for. It's a little narrow and I didn't like the writing on the front, but overall it's cool."
4.0,Very well made & lined all the way down. Very nice. Love it.
4.0,"It is an okay dress. I will wear it with a belt., white jean jacket  and a white / grape colored scarf."
4.0,Would be four stars but just a bit too pricey.
4.0,"Very pretty, I got it sooner than expect it!"
4.0,"Very Nice looking dress but God it smells so bad, i washed it like three times by now and it still have some smell. Not sure what its but it smell. Like it though, nice feminine design."
4.0,So- after reading 100+ reviews I went with the Large. I am 5'6&#34; and like 170 give or take. I could have gone with XL but the top would prob have been too loose. It is stretchy and I can tie it but it is super short. That's what I was going for though. It stretches- that's the best part. Only 4 stars because I wish the bottom half was more loose like a shirt but it's pretty form fitting when tied.
4.0,Broke easily but great when worn.
4.0,Beautiful shirt but runs really small I had to give it to my daughter
4.0,Nice dress i like it.
4.0,"Nice product, doesn't create a bulge at the top like most waist trainers, fit a lot smaller than expected but does stretch after wearing with the exception of the arm straps."
4.0,Bar bell is small
4.0,It's beautiful but very fragile. My hair got caught on the clasp and it broke as I was untangling it. Many compliments in the short time I wore it.
4.0,Super comfy and has no slip grip on the heel. You can't feel it but really helps keep them in place. I had on paid run a little after the first wear but the rest have held up to washing and multiple wears. Very satisfied and will order again.
4.0,Love the fabric and how long it is.  Will be good to wear with leggings.  My issue is with the neckline.  It feels like the shirt is on backwards! Front rides up and presses on your neck.  Maybe it is just the way my shape pulls it.  Otherwise it is a great top.
4.0,"Just wanted something for spring / summer and this caught my eye.  For the price, ($20.00, delivered with prime) it is nice and I've received numerous compliments.  The only real downside is that it's shipped from China and made that looong trip in a plastic bag.  Consequently, it got squished on one side of the bottom and now has a permanent wrinkle.  It also smelled a little when I first got it, but that has gone away.  Another downside (not a big deal for me) is that the interior is made from a loud (crackly) material.  You wouldn't want to be rooting around in your purse in a quiet room.  Overall, quite good for the price if you can overlook the other issues."
4.0,"Really cute inexpensive, stylish bag. Perfect size too!"
4.0,the product was good just didnt like the way i &#34;hung&#34; lmao Does the job keeps the girls in place
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter, she is a women’s size 4-6 (purchased the small).  Size is perfect and the material is thin, but so soft and luxurious feeling.  Purchased the blue tie-dye and super cute for teens.  Gave it 4 stars vs 5 because the neck seems very wide almost over stretched.  My teen loved them!"
4.0,"A little inconsistent but I'm still happy. The pockets are large enough to hold most smart phones, even if you have a bulky case.  Hides flaws such as chunky knees and cellulite.  High waist sits right above the belly button so great for physical activities.<br />The black pair is perfect, not see through and fit nicely without too much wiggling.<br />The navy pair, though also thick enough, took a little more maneuvering to get into.<br />The gray pair, felt a little thinner and I'll have to be mindful of which underware I wear with them."
4.0,"The logo and material are really nice. But I would suggest getting maybe 2 sizes larger. I got my regular size and they are a bit short, and fit tightly."
4.0,I have a very high instep and these are loose above the top of my foot but still comfy. I'll keep them.
4.0,"I ordered this bracelet for myself, it arrived as expected and is cute."
4.0,This is a very nice bracelet . I have only worn it a couple times so far but it is comfortable and seems to hold up well. It looks good with casual or dressy clothing. Glad I purchased it.
4.0,Very cute but runs large
4.0,This was a present for my mother on her birthday. I understand that the necklace was custom but I think that it was a bit too pricey. Though it was thin it seems like it will last a while. Over all it was a great gift and my sisters were so touched to see all of our names on the necklace.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet.  It is more on the orange side than red. But I'll still wear it . I'm still looking for a red color bracelet if you have one. Thank you.
4.0,Watch performs the way it should. Only complain on my end is that the watch it a bit small for my wrist.
4.0,Well built and quality watch
4.0,keeps me warm when it is cold outside
4.0,"This dress is very flattering when you're standing up straight and very cute. It also photographs well. However... there is almost nothing holding it together beyond the part that wraps around the empire waist so you HAVE to wear leggings or shorts underneath, otherwise your underwear will be saying ""hey"" to everyone anyway you take a seat or walk across the street. I'm considering if there is some way to add velcro to keep it closed, because aside from the openness of the front, I love it."
4.0,"This product holds lots of items.  I carry extra cables, plugs and other accessories on it.  Very nice."
4.0,"I wound up giving these to my mom since they were a little small on my watermelon of a head! On her normal sized face, these were just adorable."
4.0,Got here on time. Great shirt for the money
4.0,good for inexpensive ring
4.0,Issa hat!!! A few loose threads I fixed it tho
4.0,"Nice, well made leggings. Fit true to size. These passed the &#34;bend-over&#34; test with no underwear show-through.  No off-putting chemical smell.  Nice amount of stretch, but not too confining. I would buy these again."
4.0,these are very comfortable .  they run larger then expected so take that into consideration
4.0,Great outfit just runs somewhat small
4.0,a little big but so cute!
4.0,"The band on this watch is great. Pretty straight forward to get on, just look it up. The screen protector wasn't great, but the band is worth the cost by itself."
4.0,"love the watch. it looks great. the battery it came with was old, but we replaced it and it is working great."
4.0,Veryy good pant
4.0,I love it! I have gotten so many compliments on it. The only downside is that it unscrews by the crystals instead of the balls. This make it almost impossible to put on without help. Otherwise its a wonderful product.
4.0,These gloves are amazing for use in picking up rocks. I was running through leather gloves quite quickly until I found these. They are quite thick and can be clumsy if you are trying to pick up small things. The only thing I am noticing is that they have an odor and it a bit hard to get it washed from your hands.
4.0,"Looks great when first used, only complaint is it doesn't hold up very well. But I was able to get a summer of use from it."
4.0,Love the shorts! The strings hanging off I could do with out. Which is why I did 4 stars and not 5!
4.0,Lightweight and easily portable!
4.0,"I was looking for a purse with this type of handle. It is very attractive and a good size.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the opening to the inside of the bag is very narrow, which is a bit disappointing."
4.0,"I carry several keys with me all the time- my house, my parent's house, my sister's house, & work keys. I needed something to help me not jingle jangle all the time. This was perfect! It fits nicely in my purse, and I can only have the keys I need to use out at any time. I gave it 4 stars as I don't know how it will wear over time, but I know it will be put to a true test with me 🙂. For now, I love it!"
4.0,"I really like how these joggers feel and fit. The texture of them is very smooth, but the one downside is that I have noticed slight pilling after a few wears. The fit is exactly what I was looking for. I am 5'2 and 100 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. They are tighter fitting sweatpants, but I really like that. Not super warm so if you are looking for thick sweatpants these may not be right for you."
4.0,"I love these earrings however the backing is loose, so I have to constantly check it in case it falls out."
4.0,It's cute but it's a little too fragile!!!
4.0,This is a great dress but it does run small. I would order a size up. I am 5’5 127lbs and I ordered a medium which is what I usually wear and it is very short and tight around the chest area (I’m a 34D). The quality is very nice and well made. The fabric is soft and light but not cheap. It has a little ruffle on the bottom part of the dress and gives a boho vibe when worn. I still wear this but with leggings since it’s short. It also hasn’t shrunk in the washing machine but I recommend you hang dry it. The sleeves are long enough they don’t ride up which I found interesting since the chest area is tighter and it runs small but they did great on the sleeves. The bottom hem of the sleeve has elastic so that may help keep them in place. I love this dress and would give it 5 stars if it wasn’t small in sizing.
4.0,"I really love how tiny the stone is and i really wish this could work for me. I didn't notice that the post is only 5/16&#34;. I have a thicker bottom lip. I was able to get this in and the ball on but since its a push in, after talking for a bit, my fat lip would push the ball out for sure."
4.0,"I was recently a bridesmaid in an outdoor wedding, and my concern about sinking into the ground led me to purchase these heel protectors. Their high rating made me choose them above the other brands, and they did their job perfectly. The smaller size fit my shoes. It had been raining earlier that day, but my heels didn't get any dirt, mud, or grass stains. They also stayed on my shoes the whole time I wore them (up until the indoor reception), which I know other people seemed to have problems with. My only complaint is that while they are &#34;clear,&#34; they are still a bit too noticeable. A few people noticed them, and when you're all dressed up for a special occasion you want to look flawless. It's kind of like having a bra strap showing, in a way. But the most important thing is that my shoes didn't get stuck in the mud while I was walking down the aisle in my too-tall heels!"
4.0,I'm large normally so o order a XL to be on the safe side but still small
4.0,They could be a little thicker but I love them
4.0,seem to be good quality and lightweight.  Fingers could be a bit longer but will be ok.  Plan to use them for driving as medication required I keep hands out of sun
4.0,I purchased it as decoration for a baby shower.
4.0,Like them so far keep sweating to a minimum which in turn keeps feet warm while hunting.
4.0,"I really love the style of this shirt, but I think the one I got wasn’t made quite right.  The gathering under the bust is not symmetrical, and it looks kinda weird and off-kilter.  However, I DO really like the thick fabric, the rich bright blue (Pantone’s color of the year!), and the cute style.  I have narrow hips, so anything with volume in that area gives the illusion of having more of a waist.  I ordered this to wear to a baby shower; I’m not sure yet if I will wear it... if I put the bow (which is a separate belt) under the part with the gathering, it looks a little better.  For reference, I’m 5’ 7”, 135lbs, measurements 36-26.5-37 (narrow hips), and I ordered a small and it fit well.  There’s a little bit of stretch to the fabric, and it feels very comfortable on.  I think the construction is just luck of the draw!"
4.0,"Normal fit, good (light weight) fabric. Color as pictured."
4.0,Good bicycling sock for the price
4.0,"I'm very satisfied with mine. You get what you pay for people. Not the fanciest but I got them extremely fast, everything is in tact, & looks beautiful. Nothing was wobbly and works properly. I would definitely recommend! Looks exactly how it does in the picture."
4.0,"I am 5'4"" 125 and ordered the S and M to try. Both fit, but I am keeping the M because they look more like joggers in that size. S was tight in the rear like leggings and I wanted an easy fit. The dark grey camo color is super cute- it reads as leopard print. Four stars because while the fabric is soft, it feels plasticky, and I am not sure yet how they will hold up."
4.0,"Should have ordered Large instead of Medium: waist size is 36""."
4.0,Great product for the price. over the time the finish will begin to wear off. I used it with my withings active pop and it added a very nice touch to the watch that made it look much more premium.
4.0,Cute top with great fit!
4.0,Cute earings
4.0,"First let me just say I absolutely LOVE this outfit. I'm 5'2 and bigger at at the bottom then the top so I ordered a large to make sure the shorts fit (I'm always curious what size people ordered). The shorts are a little tight and I had to get the top taken up but that was to be expected. I would give this a 4.5 if I could; there was a slight bit of adjustment that had to take place for me to be able to wear it.<br /><br />*If this helps I normally wear a size 8 or 10 in jeans depending on Gods grace and how much stretch they have in them, lol"
4.0,Nice shirt. SIL enjoyed it
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:acc49cf92c8b49c5479b26988693bf71]] Being pregnant, I do not like to buy pregnancy pants and clothes because it will not last me. During this time, I tend to wear more dresses so that it is not as conforming and easy to move around in.  I sit a lot for work, and Zanzea women loose sleeveless maxi dress is very comfortable. It is sleeveless, so I can pair with anything to cover if it ever gets cold.. Blue is by far my favorite color and this shade of navy will go with any covering I have.<br /><br />It is not just a simple maxi dress, it is cotton and has linen feel to it. It is breezy and very cool to wear consider I get hot flashes now that I am pregnant.  I love how it is not just a even length maxi dress, but have unique design to it. It has irregular cuts on the bottom making it fun and unique to wear.  The side pockets make it easy for me to hold my cell phone and also small items that I need.  It is loosely fit which is perfect for my increasing weight and also size. The neckline area is not too low cut in the front, but is a bit low cut in the back, so I tend to wear a small tank top inside for coverage.  I know that I will be wearing this maxi dress even after I deliver my baby.  I can make it more form fitting with belts around my waist.  It could also be a easy to throw on bathing suit cover in the future. I love all the possibilities this maxi dress will bring me. It is machine wash easy, but I do like to air dry it since it has the linen quality and will get wrinkly in the dryer.  Perfect outfit for a summer day, and with great layering, it is also great for the winter months.<br /><br />I was chosen to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"It's beautiful,  too small for me, but absolutely beautiful. It arrived in a timely manner."
4.0,I plan on wearing it as a longer shirt with Capri
4.0,"Excellent, recommended, fast shipping"
4.0,It is nice. It is small in size. I expected it to be larger. Stone not very big.
4.0,It’s beautiful but a little big. Nice length
4.0,"Overall this is a nice looking wallet.  It can holds plenty of cards, ID, and bills.  The wallet however is just a little too large for what I was hoping for.  Even empty it is thick as there are many layers of leather.  If you are looking for a large capacity wallet this would be a good choice, it just didn't fit my needs."
4.0,"The color is great, just as seen on line. Fits awesome. Very thin & see thru, but other then that I love the dress."
4.0,Fits as expected and better quality than I thought. Thanks.
4.0,"I wish the jacket was lined, because it isn’t it is super lightweight. But all in all very pleased!"
4.0,This handbag is absolutely adorable. Everyone stops to admire it and after I tell them that the phone actually works then they want one. The only drawback is that after you take a call your iPhone will launch your playlist. So I’ve had to take the phone out and open my playlist so I can close it. If anyone knows what setting will stop this from happening I’d gratefully appreciate it.
4.0,"We've had a few different versions of these masks and this one is comparable. The fact that you can still see the eye holes from the front is annoying, our cheaper masks with less LEDs, you can't even tell where the eye holes are from a viewers perspective. This mask you can definitely see where the eyes are, it actually distorts the picture on the mask because they're 2 holes of the picture missing.<br />I do like that you can upload your own images to use, make sure you don't have too much background stuff and just the face of the picture you're uploading or it looks like a mess of leds. The scrolling text is awesome and you can display whatever you'd like people to see. All in all, good fun mask, would love the eye holes to be less noticeable and blend with the LEDs of the mask, like actually display lights colors as our other less expensive masks do."
4.0,this two piece set is cute!<br />the top fit a little small on me
4.0,"If you like large, dynamic earrings, these are perfect."
4.0,This item is really cute and I got alot of compliments. The only problem with this item is that it took me so long (more than 1/2 hour) to put them on my shirt. The clip is so small and hard to hold open. Very difficult to put on shirt.
4.0,Fit nicely but they are very slippery.  Do not stay in place. Feel like they are sliding.
4.0,"Love the look. Wish it was a bit sturdier, would pay a bit more for better quality."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift as it is the birthstone of a friend. The quality of the stone and pendant is positive. The stone color was darker than I was expecting and fairly large in size. But I tend to like very delicate pendants. So many people would love the size of it. Probably comparable to a US quarter in size? Anyway, the company was very responsive and kind when I told them that I was looking for something smaller. And even though it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, their customer service support was outstanding. And I was able to find the &#34;right&#34; size stone with their help!! Thank you!!!"
4.0,"These earrings are very cute! Good size--not too little, but not too big either. The only negative thing I have to say is it's a little hard to get the backs on--gotta push real hard. Other than that, they are my new fave."
4.0,"Nice cotton, but shrunk vertically quite a bit, hitting at or above waist after washing. Also has an extra-full ruffled bottom. Now wish I'd returned because of fullness. I'll wear with jacket mostly."
4.0,"I ordered 2 pairs of the 3/4 length capris. The material is extremely comfortable and so far the leggings seem to be of good quality. I ordered both a gray pair and a black pair, and neither is see-through. The waist felt true to size. My only issue was the length, as they turned out a bit longer than I expected. Because of my height (5'3&#34;), I'm used to things being a little longer on me. These go all the way down to my ankles, however."
4.0,"The sleeves are great. Several friends thought that I had had my arms inked. Though on closer exam it is apparent that they are cloth.They seem to keep the sun at bay at least a little bit. I must say that as a bicycle rider, if car drivers see you as a old man  with full arm sleeves they seem to give you gust a bit more room. I should have had them after boot camp 35 years ago. They look god and wash up well."
4.0,"This scarf seemed well made. The fabric was smooth, and it tied well. However, I had to return it because the color was too different from the image on screen. Instead of an aqua or turquoise with white and light pink, it was Kelly green with bubblegum pink."
4.0,"Bought this as a swimsuit cover up- It is perfect for over a swimsuit, sports bra or paired with a tank top"
4.0,I want to rescind my first review in which I complained that the pants had to be dry cleaned. I washing them and they came out fine. They do need ironing.
4.0,A perfect casual dress for days in the office.
4.0,Very comfortable it cute should of took a picture
4.0,Keeps the sulfuric acid like sweat from my forehead and scalp from seeping into my eyes.
4.0,"The material of this feels like a swimsuit. You can see in the photos there was a little snag on one of the straps of mine. It's pretty good quality, I love the colors."
4.0,Wish it would been heavier
4.0,"Nice but holes on charm are too close to edge. The clasp is sturdy, however the ring that is used to attach the charm to the clasp is poorly made. My dog lost her charm after only a week of wear.  I did really like the design, so I ordered another and will secure the charm myself so she does not loose it a second time."
4.0,Hat is too big so I'm hoping to make my hair bigger so it fits better. Nothing I can't work with though
4.0,Very LARGE frames.  Super cute style but very large for my face.  Quality great for $10 but juat didn't work for me.
4.0,Nice And warm
4.0,"Used for our wedding and they were absolutely perfect. Plus 3 pieces for the price, cant beat that!! Took one star away because we never actually recieved the cuff links."
4.0,"These are our go to for under dresses and skirts for my toddler. Her school requires that girls wear short under skirts or dresses. The lace band on the bottom of these shorts are perfect for under her dresses. My only complaint is that some of the more heavily worn pairs are staring to come apart at the lace seams. But otherwise, they are super awesome"
4.0,"Love the wallet, wasn't too much liking of the purse, didn't too much care for the style of the purse, but loved it just bc it was a I Love Lucy purse."
4.0,Cute earrings. I wish the holes for the post were bigger.
4.0,"it was a good buy, but the face is too small."
4.0,"My only issue is that the two earrings aren't identical, so one doesn't fit my ear the way I want it to, no matter how much I adjust it... Tarnishes horribly, but that's an easy fix."
4.0,"I like it, but I thought the stone would be a lighter blue than it is. Still pretty, but not what I had wanted."
4.0,very nice product very nice product
4.0,Returned for smaller size
4.0,"The Vintage Little Mermaid in Dangerous Waters is Very pretty and who doesn't have a love for the Little Mermaid?<br /> I really have an appreciation for the fact that this pendant is a more grown-up way to express ones love for the Little Mermaid as well as the child in each of us.<br />Missed the boat! In the advertised photograph you are able to see the ship in the background. In the actual necklace it is completely missing. Not a deal breaker, but I find it disappointing and it is something to consider.<br />Keeping in mind that the pendant and the eighteen inch chain are costume jewelry, as well as the age of the person that will wear it, I'd say it is made to be worn gently.<br /> I don't think the necklace is intended for a young child as with a few slight tugs of the chain the circular link for the clasp separated. With a stronger tug it would definitely break.<br />Depending on the maturity of the child I think a tween is the youngest I'd give this to. Furthermore, I feel that the full price of this necklace is a bit too high for a child that hasn't learned to be careful with jewelry, and as a mother of four, and a grandmother of three, I think it it would irresponsible of me not to mention the dangers of jewelry that is not intended to release easily to prevent strangulation or injury. We don't want to rely on the clasp breaking. Okay, so the mom in me couldn't resist the lecture.<br />The print art is beautiful, even with the missing ship.<br />The chain length is nice. I bought this pretty little mermaid necklace for my son's twenty year old girlfriend as she not only loves the Disney Little Mermaid film, but loves mermaids of all kinds. So although the pendant is not Disney, it is a more mature take on it. It will likely please her. I am sure she will love it and get a lot of use out of it. She wears several costume jewelry pieces so I don't think she will be disappointed in the beauty of this piece.<br />Both the necklace and pendant arrived together quickly and nicely packaged. I love the tiny little organza bag this comes in. It really makes for a nice presentation, as well as a nice way to store it for safe keeping.<br />I'd have provided a five star rating had the ship been in the picture, (the boat missed so to speak), and had the clasp not pulled slightly apart with only two small tugs. The sort of tug that would occur with regular wear. Not a firm hard tug. I think the full price of the necklace and pendant is a little high, but if you love the print art enough it makes up for it.<br />I am honored to have been selected to receive this pendant and chain at a discount in exchange for an honest, and unbiased review. I have toggled between the three and four stars in my attempt to give precisely that. Wish there were 1/2 stars. That said I selected the four star because I know how much my son's girlfriend will love it for the print alone."
4.0,They fit fine and they are what I expected.<br />The only comment would be that the construction on the right sandal was cut a limitless ruff.  It does not hurt or rub up against my foot but you can see the jagged (not sharp) edges that indicate the mold did not cut properly.<br />They are for gym shower use and I feel very secure in them.
4.0,"I love them and they are comfortable. A bit pricy, but in general I like them."
4.0,Great readers
4.0,Great looking shirt but way 2 large
4.0,"Very pretty dress. Fits well. Runs a little small through the arms and chest, but not so much that I will be uncomfortable in it."
4.0,"It's thinner than I expected, but I like it otherwise."
4.0,"The masks are soft, on the small side. For a small child maybe 5 and under. Satisfied pruchase"
4.0,"Love it, just what i expected. Will have the arms altered shorter though and should be perfect for my side. Bit pricey for the material and would be nice to have the pockets on the inside too"
4.0,Such a cute romper. I ultimately returned because I did not need but I would buy again in the future. I am 18/20 and the 2x fit great. Comfy and stylish
4.0,"I use an extra large hat.  this fits great and kept my head, ears and neck warm in low teens wind chill."
4.0,"Looked as advertised, wears great, a bit smaller than advertised reguarding the width, I would say it is more like a 6.5mm not an 8mm. Shipped fast nice packaging."
4.0,Needed it for a costume for a performance.  Worked beautifully.
4.0,"Comfortable, reasonably priced and block all the UV rays"
4.0,Love them. The coating isn't as thick as Oakley originals and that's why I give it a 4 instead of 5.
4.0,This is a really pretty and cute little ring. But it is really made for a child's hand. I ended up sitting it inside another ring and it works great  that way. Will try and get a picture soon. The seller was super nice I thought I had gotten the wrong ring because it was small. They sent another but it was the same as the first one. Very nice seller and cute ring.
4.0,Nice addition to a chest rig. Definitely would recommend it. The only problem is that it's difficult to adjust for size while wearing it.
4.0,"Good quality, soft, I'm a 34d and I got a medium and it was pretty big under the bust."
4.0,"Adorable swim suit. The only reason why I did not give it a 5 star review is because the top is way too revealing on me. The cut of the top makes your breast look large and that might be problem for women who already have large breast like myself. The bottoms are great and I love how the hide my &#34;mommy belly.&#34; I would definitely purchase more of these swim suits. Overall, awesome swim suit for the price. I did purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,I keep them inside my reusable shopping bags and put the bag in my trunk. whenever i go shopping i just grab the shopping bag. The only thing I can think of to complain is that the tags are not that visible so it slows the checkout process just a little bit. but I really like these bags.
4.0,"These are a good value but not nearly as loose as they should be or as I would have hoped. My 87 year old mother has vascular issues associated with a bone marrow disease she has, along with congestive heart failure so loose fitting socks are imperative. These fit, in my observation and opinion, tighter than the Dr. Scholls diabetic socks that you can buy at your local Target or Walmart and the knit fabric is also a lighter texture than the Dr. Scholls. Don't get me wrong, these are nice enough and a very good value, much less than the Dr. Scholls. Also, what I really like a lot about them is they fit looser across the top of the foot where it transitions to the ankle area which is a huge plus for my mother as she has bone surgery a few years back and an ankle fusion which has significantly widened one of her feet and her ankle and these socks fit that foot much better than the Dr. Scholls brand.  The problem with the socks is the top elastic band;  it fits a little more snugly than I would have hoped and my mother tends to complain they are too tight in that specific area. Had the elastic band been looser, I would have given these socks 5 stars but because of that alone they get 4."
4.0,Sure it was good quality thick and nicely made. But warning it does run small. So definitely order one size up. I gave it four stars only because I really felt that should’ve been listed in the description. It would’ve saved me and the hassle of returning it.
4.0,"This dress is a good value for the price. It fits well, the fabric is a good quality."
4.0,Beautiful earrings! A little longer than expected.
4.0,used for flying.  Kept legs from swelling.
4.0,"A little tight, but. Great"
4.0,"Cute pattern, love the pockets, material is nice quality/thicker than I expected for the price. My only issue is that it's too long on me. I'm 5'7 and the dress hangs about an inch below my knees, which just doesn't look great on me personally. Still a great dress though. Will maybe look better in the summer without tights and booties ☀️"
4.0,Some what small but nice
4.0,"I like the quality of the item -  nicely packaged as well if you wanted to give it as a gift. The small key ring and chain inside can easily be removed - twist a link out of the way and you’re done. Not so with the clasp/clip on the outside - you’d have to cut off the leather strap holding it to the case. Same as others have stated, I was experiencing intermittent problems with accidentally tripping the car alarm or popping the trunk open when I would have the remote in my pocket and something else in my pocket would press against it. This holder solved that issue so it serves its intended purpose for me very well. But the color of it is nowhere close to being red - I’d give it something like a “salmon” color or something like that .... or perhaps an extremely washed out and totally faded red. Color aside, I think it’ll work well for me!"
4.0,"eye glasses seems a little large on my face, and tends to slip off often, I'm always trying to adjust, but its nice to look at."
4.0,"I bought an XL (I'm about 200 and 5'6), wear a 36DD. So comfy and cute except that it was way too short for my boobs. If I put my arms up I'm flashing everyone. Unfortunately going to have to return.<br /><br />GET IT if you're small-chested!!! Adorable and not uncomfortable at all like the other reviewers said!"
4.0,Love the drew and how it fits- it's a bit sheer in the skirt and has a liner but might need an additional slip
4.0,This jacket is lightweight and kind of thin. Not great for keeping warm on cold days. True to size!
4.0,"Okay fit, quality very good"
4.0,Works well in Texas heat !
4.0,"Bought as a birthday gift for a friend. She travels a lot, and needed something that would fold up and fit in the suitcase. This fits the bill perfectly. Brim is wide enough to shade her neck and upper face. It's cute too!"
4.0,Quedo muy lindo el vestido
4.0,"Not my favorite pair of earrings but they'll do. Wish they were a lil bigger, I simply wear them to church."
4.0,Everything is great about these shoes. I really like how deep the tread it. Great boot for the price.
4.0,"This is a pretty cute romper. I ordered the size 4/6 and I think it fits fairly well. The reason I knocked off one star is because it's a lot of work if you need to take it off to use the restroom. For example: the tie in the back,  the belt and then the zipper.<br /><br />For reference I'm 5'1"" 34D-26-36 126lbs"
4.0,"The reflective front and light up back is great, however, i have to use a pen or hard object to unclip it when i am done."
4.0,Very pretty but has a tendency to snag on hair & clothes.
4.0,"Cute, flat ~ I like them."
4.0,Elegant and high quality ties for 1/3 the price of those in men's clothing stores.
4.0,Haven't worn much yet; but like the large easy to read face and the band will be good for working out
4.0,"I like this dress. It fit great almost all over but the arms are tight. It is a bit linger than I expected too. I am short at 5' 3&#34; 140lbs and it hits at mid calf. The material is nice, and the quality seems good. Still going to use it. Looks good with a peticoat."
4.0,These are nice colors and work as expected. The break- away connection is  a  good feature.  The hooks are a bit stiff but will hopefully be easier to use with time.
4.0,Love this hat and ponytail holder in the back!
4.0,"For all of you ladies who don’t have a flat stomach like myself please understand this will show EVERY SINGLE FLAW in your body lol. The material is like a soft non shiny spandex. And my 200lb 5’7 self has no business wearing spandex lol. Props to those that  can wear this, I just love carbs.  Also if  Oh we’re thinking if you could wear this in your corporate office. The answer is no. You’ll end up in HR.  Hope this helps!"
4.0,The elastic band on the shorts is cheaply made. It doesn't have enough stretch to it.
4.0,"Love the sloth print, made well.  Can even get a longer strap if you want to use it more as an over the shoulder vs. wrist."
4.0,"I liked the quality,love to wear it often"
4.0,"I am only giving 4 stars because of the chain which is beautiful but very thin,too thin for someone like me who has children who like to pull on shiny things. Other than the thin chain thus necklace is absolutely beautiful! The first thing you get to open is the gorgeous Tiffany style box that is a dark red velvet color with a cute pink bow across the top,when you open the box the cross catches your eye because of how lovely it is. When the light hits the little cubic zirconias it shines bright like diamonds would. Like I said I will be purchasing another chain but this necklace is so worth every dollar. DISCLAIMER I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW"
4.0,they fit her great and do the job
4.0,"I ordered this dress in XL ""pink leaf"" pattern. It fits well and it's very comfortable. I usually wear an XL for tops and XXL for bottoms. The v-neck is a bit too much V for me, but I can solve with by wearing a camisole or something. The pockets don't add to my hip volume, which is great because I have a generous amount already. The dress doesn't come with a ""how to wash"" tag, so it's good to remember that the listing recommends ""hand-wash only."""
4.0,"I have already review this, but received on time and at little to no cost. Love the color and the shape of the glasses, they keep the glare of the sun out of your eyes, the only thing is they need to have the arms tightened up so if we want we can keep them on the top of our head."
4.0,Not bulky and fit well.
4.0,The outfit is very cute and fits like I expected it. Very pretty pattern.
4.0,Pretty top. Not much shape to the waist though.
4.0,I love the fit.  but now that I cannot wear them at work and they're just sitting in my drawer.
4.0,"I'm really hard in sunglasses and constantly break or lose them, so it's nice to have an inexpensive verity to do this."
4.0,so gorgeous! recommended
4.0,Not as fluffy as I wanted but thr children love it.
4.0,"You can find these for less in the stores, but all of the ones I have seen have been the 8&#34; length.  With my big wrists I needed to get the 9&#34; ones & the price from Amazon wasn't that much more money.  I have no complaints with it yet."
4.0,Really pretty but one closure is weak which makes me cautious wearing them.
4.0,It does fit quite large but I will tuck it in and wear it
4.0,Too small.  If it weren't in England I'd exchange it for a 3xl. Warm though.  I'll just donate it and find an American product.<br />Bummed.
4.0,Lmao me in the girl I gave this to split up
4.0,Very cute belts.  Love it.
4.0,Not quite as blue and clear in color as descripted very opaque
4.0,"I initially loved it, but after one wash it quickly shrunk. Comfortable material, minus the tag."
4.0,"My daughter loved these. They do run big, but work great. My other daughter wears them now. The lights are very bright, just have to remember to charge them."
4.0,Really comfy and the fit is great but the holes in the jeans are much larger than I would've wanted.  The photo makes it look worn but not &#34;holey&#34; so I was disappointed in that because I can't wear them as often as I would like because they look way too distressed for my liking.
4.0,It was as expected for the price. But a nice gift for a young man.
4.0,"the fabric is nice, even if it is like. The shirt fabric does not directly absorb water or sweat, and the shirt dries quickly. The lenght is correct and fit well.<br />If you have big arms and biceps, the sleeve will tighten"
4.0,"Has survived one (relatively easy) trip so far.  Looks nice.  I'm not sure I would trust a laptop or iPad in those side compartments, though, unless they are also in some hard and/or padded protective case, because the sides of those compartments are not as hard as you might think.  If it got buried under a lot of other luggage or thrown around or bashed hard by luggage handlers, not sure it would actually protect any electronics in there.  Probably okay for the carry-on, where you're handling it yourself.  I don't think I'd trust the side compartments if the luggage is being checked.  Other than that, it looks good and seems as sturdy as you could possibly expect for non-metal, plastic luggage with zippers.  The wheels have held up so far, and make the luggage very easy to handle, even when very full."
4.0,Missing one undie!!<br />Though the underwear are super cute and stretchy I was missing an underwear I received 11 instead of 12 and it was the one with all the koala print. Mistakes happen I guess 😩
4.0,I really like this necklace.  I wish that I could find earrings to match.
4.0,"This is such a cute outfit! However, it is a little weird in places. A little bit baggy under the right arm due to extra material. . The material is so soft and silky, and it is such a cute print.  I ordered a small and always wear an extra small.  The outfit fits well but is slightly baggy up top. The straps are adorable which helps."
4.0,Fit how I tbought it would
4.0,My son used them once and he likes them. I like they come in a bag to store them in.
4.0,"The product is larger than expected, but my daughters will grow into them. Better big than small."
4.0,It would have been nice if the white part of the hat was elastic because it didn't fit my 3 month old
4.0,"I love the length, the patterns and the material.  I gave it 4 stars because the band is a little too loose.  I have to take it in to fit snuggly.  Because of that I don’t always wear it as a tube wrap( awesome concept) but literally wrap the entire piece instead of inserting my head into the tube.  Wish it was snug, then it would be a 5 Star for sure!"
4.0,"The wallet was great, just a little small to fit my needs.  It arrived quickly, and in perfect condition."
4.0,"Bought this for my husband and it is a great product but rums very small.  Started out with a large, his size and it was way to small, returned it and got an XL, again too small.  I am going to try an XXL, if that doesn't work we will give up.  The manufacturer needs to recalibrate the way they size because they are way off."
4.0,I have to return this! its a beautiful dress but the size didn't match the chart.
4.0,It is small. I hope the person I bought it for doesn't think it is more for a child than an adult!
4.0,"These are beautiful belts! Quality finish on both. My only gripe is that mine don't seem to have much &#34;give.&#34; I wear a size 8, occasionally a 10, as I have broad shoulders. These belts seem to run a bIt small. Stretch it to the max around natural waistline jeans. And, many jeans seem to have a bit of a dropped waist, stretching out the belts even more."
4.0,I ordered my regular size and it fit perfectly.  Cute for the price...can't wait to wear it! I will be ordering another one in a different color.
4.0,Great shirt. Got many compliments on it. 👌🏽
4.0,Love the color. Clarity COULD be better. But for the price I'm not upset. It's pretty. Not sure how long the stone is going to stay in but it seems that their customer service is pretty on top of things so I'm not worried. I'd honestly say if you're hesitant on buying... dont be. Go ahead and get this ring. I normally wear a 5.75 and ordered the 5 as many reviews say it runs a bit large and it fit just fine. So far I'm happy.
4.0,A little small for a size 3.... Otherwise very cute!
4.0,"The costume is really cute but a bit too short for my taste (and I’m a short person with short legs). Also, I’m having the hardest time getting rid of the wrinkles/creases on the dress due to packaging and I noticed on one of the puffed sleeves the seam was coming apart a little (fortunately it gets hidden by the apron)."
4.0,"For the value the sweatshirt is a great buy. Sweatshirt is on heavier side and is definitely a cold weather hoodie, can see myself over heating in it in fall/spring.  Fits well and hood is a decent size, draw cords for hood are on longer side but can be cut to your preferred length."
4.0,Sweat outfit is very cute. But it runs kind a baggie. You might want to size down.
4.0,Wished it was just a couple inches longer on my body so I can cover like 1/8 of my buttocks. Fits nice and very warm.
4.0,"Meets my needs perfectly. This is the right size and without any tacky branding. The interior pockets are not lined, but I am very happy with my purchase"
4.0,These pajamas are very comfortable I just ordered the wrong size.
4.0,Fit as expected and gold writing looked really good.
4.0,"I've had mine for about 4 months now and its holding up just fine. My only gripe is that the black almost looks more like a deep, dark olive more so than black.  Still much better than working out and sweating in my original S3 Classic leather band."
4.0,"My daughter loves this pendant...shes 5 and its a bit large on her little body, but she will grow into it:)  The best part is whenever you show it to anyone, they all squint and say &#34;is that a giraffe?&#34;...then they all get a confused look when we are laughing.  Seriously, happens every time.  She loves it though, and that's what matters:)"
4.0,"Great style,thick material,Fall/winter style...a bit too big/long....but can work....."
4.0,Enjoy the comfort.
4.0,I have washed and dried the shirt it didn’t shrink or fade so I’m happy about that
4.0,"I purchased this pair of socks after reading a rave review in Runners World.  I usually wear Balega's for running and triathlon training and have had no blisters in any pairs.  I'm wearing the Darn Tough for the first time today, 14 hours and counting, without any complaints. They are light and well padded in the tie box, and have no seams to cause blisters. I like them as well as the Balega, and they feel a tad thicker overall."
4.0,Love the colors of this top and feels great while working.
4.0,"The discs are nice, pretty colors.  Resin and wood ratio is good."
4.0,I am sure my niece will love it with all the glitter and shine and the long chain.  It will look very nice with t-shirts or sweaters.
4.0,Love it fit just right. In fast shipping
4.0,"i though this was smaller , bought it because of the reviews mentioning this,<br />i guess not all wholes are the same lol, it is not small on me, but  i still love the design,"
4.0,cute summer bracelet. Its cheap made but also cheap price so..... Its all good!
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous!  The embroidery is nicely done.  Wearing for a formal evening event.  The smallest size is &#34;S&#34; which was too big.  I am having it altered - about 3&#34; taken in at the bodice.  The back zipper didn't lay flat, having darts put in on either side of the zipper. Bra is sewn in which is really nice and very comfortable. I am 5'1&#34; and 107 lbs.  Usually take a 2-4 in dresses.  This fits more like a 6-8."
4.0,I am a size 12 Skirt fit XL. I like the pattern and length
4.0,Perfect for everyday. It’s made of a thick material so it’s not thin or transparent at all. I ordered a medium but wish I would have gone with the small but it still fits nice. I can wear with flats and it doesn’t drag at all I’m 5’7 size 6/8.
4.0,"Occasionally it seems like they're impairing my circulation (i.e. my foot starts to &#34;go to sleep&#34;). But that may be user malfunction too, I don't know as this is my first pair of bike shoes. But overall, for the price they seem like a good deal and so far I like them. Having gotten more used to cycling with clipless pedals, I'd say that I've raised my average speed by about 10%."
4.0,Fits on frame and flips up easily
4.0,"The labeling says &#34;large&#34;, but they may be a tad snug for that. But I am happy with them. The padding is pretty good, but it tends to pinch the sensitive area on occasion. I would buy again, but would get an XL next time."
4.0,good fabric!
4.0,Sun protection while doing outside activities
4.0,"The material of the dress is comfortable, the neck area was a little constricting for me personally. But a $13 dress that is cute? I'll take it."
4.0,Cute skirt! It worked perfect for an alien Halloween costume. There’s no stretch to it and the material is super hot but it was great for the 6 hours I wore it. I was kinda worried about it fitting at first but it was fine. I wear a size 18 in jeans so you have a an idea of how the skirt fit.
4.0,"I really like this necklace, it is adorable. Retailer sent me inaccurate info in regards to shipping but still a positive experience otherwise. Perfect for any otter lover!"
4.0,I like it but it fits somewhat on the small side. I normally wear medium shirts but I should have gone large with this one because you see my belly. Otherwise I like it and when I loose this baby weight it should fit fine. It form fitted around the top whoch is nice and not baggy looking.
4.0,disapointed but a but it was a nice dress
4.0,"Very well fitted, but not very sturdy material. Arrived fast, and in brand-new condition. Material seems to be slighty fragile but still able to wear often."
4.0,Liked the feel. Fits small
4.0,This ring is so cute. The only thing it does run small it’s a little tight on days my hands a swollen. Other than that it did not tarnish it still looks like new and I wash my hands slit durning the day.  Great product
4.0,all the blk rubbed off
4.0,The mask touches my eyes and bugs me but I will work on that. Just need some good eyeliner and smudgy face paint around my eyes and I should be a decent uncle fester
4.0,These t-shirts are great. They are soft and I think I will get a lot of use out of them. I was going to order more and noticed that the price went up a few bucks so I decided to wait. Nevertheless I am pleased with them.
4.0,"nice flannel material, but classic Chinese misfitting.  It is barely tall enough for me to stand in, but the pant legs are way way too long as are the arm sleeves."
4.0,Just a little large
4.0,I received this item in a timely manner and they look great. I wear a size 11-11.5 shoe USA size it's a bit short for my foot so go with a larger size if your about my size foot. Also buy socks separately amazon has a pair on here for $3.00 the socks that come with it are so tiny it's a joke. With the exception of the socks I am happy with my purchase.
4.0,"It's really cute, but short.  Fits great, if you wanted a crop sweatshirt.  I'll wear it around the house and be happy with it."
4.0,Got this for a Christmas gift and my dad loved it.
4.0,"These unicorn hats just arrived; over all I am happy with the purchase.<br />pros<br />+decent quality for the price, especially  the knit style hat.<br />+ arrived on time<br />+ they look cute<br />CONS<br />- they don't have tags that state what they are made of or where they were made. This is ILLEGAL in the US per FTC regulations.  For me this is more of a note to the seller and to amazon.<br /><br />This isn't a big problem. I assume they are made in china. The white hat is clearly 100% polyester. The knit hat seems to be made mostly of acrylic yarn.  Which is all what you would expect. None the less the lack of proper labeling seems  shady to me as far as the seller and manufacturing."
4.0,"Used it on a ""floppy"" Wesley fedora and it's working quite well to keep it from being so floppy. My only issue is you can see some white residue on the brim. It's not terrible and is really only noticeable when holding the hat in your hands, but it's still there nonetheless."
4.0,Definitely not a nose ring though
4.0,Works as supposed to. Colors are nice and vibrant.
4.0,Grandson didn't care for mask. Bothered his eyes.
4.0,This top is super soft and cute. However the size is juniors size so a large is an 11/13
4.0,I'm 5ft even & 138lbs and I got a small but it fits like a medium which I like but it's not as heavyweight as I thought it was going to be. It's a really good buy for the price though.
4.0,"The turtle looks great, but is a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  Not a problem or anything."
4.0,"Good enough for the price, can’t beat it. I gave four stars it going back to add another. I bought 4 in different gold tones now don’t know who to give them to.<br />I ordered MENS but got WOMENS RINGS. THEYRE STLL CUTE."
4.0,This was a beautiful dress I did end up returning it cause it just wasnt what I wanted for my event! But it's very flattering and the color looks great on!
4.0,Well-made. Nice material. Summer white. I’m satisfied.
4.0,"The size is smaller than actual sizes in USA. It looks comfy and light enough though. I like the style and colors, I got two but will have to be gifted though. I would say the sizes are 1 perhaps 2 sizes smaller than what expected depending if someone wants to wear them tight or loose."
4.0,"I am short, 5&#34;0 so I had to have it hemmed. lightweight material"
4.0,A little small.  The thing I was disappointed about is the way the material print wad sown together.  I felt like the front should have had more print but instead it was more of the back ground color.
4.0,"So this just arrived today and I really like the design, but the color seems more light brown than the rose color in the picture. It’s not bad but I’m not totally in love with it. The fabric seems okay, no stringy pieces hanging from it, I just wish it was a different color. I really liked the pinkish tint in the picture."
4.0,"These are great when its sunny and will protect your eyes well. But when it gets cloudy it's alittle too dark and if its very cloudy or even when the sun starts going down at the end of the day, it can be very hard to see."
4.0,I ordered this dress in a small and medium because depending on the brand I can wear either (5'4&#34; 120 lbs).  They both fit.  The small and medium are very similar in size.  The small is only slightly smaller than the medium. I kept the medium simply because it is slightly longer.  I really like the dress. Quality of material is nice and it drapes nicely.
4.0,"These are definitely not workout leggings as they do tend to fall down throughout the day. The waist was a bit loose and was the main reason they kept falling down. I'm personally not a fan of the fabric (90% polyester, 10% elastane), it felt like I wasn't wearing anything. They weren't see through and passed the squat test for me.<br /><br />(Waist:29, Hips:44)"
4.0,Nice chain. Good value. Excellent shipping!  Packaged great. Thank you!
4.0,"Pretty skirt, fit perfect! I received a lot of compliments!"
4.0,They work well. Good price! Received in a very timely manner.
4.0,"This is a nice sheer nude tank that will work nicely under my Halloween costume. I'm 5'2"", 140 and the large fits well."
4.0,"nice, but too heavy"
4.0,"Super cute, the bow isnt the best but that's not why I got it. If your baby is on the smaller side it definitely runs big."
4.0,"I love these earrings, but do wish they had a better closing method - the tiny notch which is supposed to catch is hard to tell if it is properly connected while wearing yet comes open too easily, I am worried about losing them. But that is the only negative, everything else is perfect - size, design, color, finish - all perfect!!!"
4.0,Very beautiful dress. The fabric is soft and stretchy which is a Plus. I really love this dress.
4.0,"Material is fantastic the blue color I'd beautiful the logo is awesome. My only complaint is that the small fit kinda wide on me, but I'm very small. Overall i love it!"
4.0,The colors and its a dress
4.0,My best friend during the cold winter months of Chicago. For some reason my feet can never stay warm and these puppies are thick and comfortable to walk in. Also has a great grip so you won't slip and slide. Most definitely buying another pair for next winter
4.0,I got my true size which results in the knot being small and higher up. May want to order a size up to get a knot like in the picture
4.0,"Dress looks great on my wife overall, but I rated it 4 of 5 and said it was &#34;somewhat small&#34; because the zipper is a bit hard to close for both my wife and even for me working at a better angle--could simply be a quality control issue on this particular dress or could be that it was made just a bit too small."
4.0,"Little thin like usual costume material but for one night it did the job. Super cute, I cut the finger tips off the gloves for more comfort. Fit like a glove, got a lot of compliments. 5’1, 98lbs for reference. Got xs"
4.0,"I love them, I just wish there was a little bit more space for adjusting"
4.0,"This skirt is so pretty! For the price, I thought the quality was good (the hem was a bit uneven but not too noticeable). The length is good but the waist band was a bit too tight on me (I’m 5’0, usually a size S or M/4-6). I’ll definitely wear it again, it’s just not the most comfortable skirt I own!"
4.0,"Oh this is so flattering and cute! The fabric is fine, not too thick or thin and doesn’t bunch up weird under the arms. I really like the ombre pink color too. I ran it through the washer and the color didn’t bleed so that’s good news. It is also not terrible with sweat stains.. bear in mind it’s not black so it still shows, it’s not terrible though.<br /><br />Only bad thing is for me the arms are a little long, and my arms are not that short they are normal for a small."
4.0,"I ordered the jacket a little bigger than what I usually wear. The material is interesting, although I like the color of the wrists and the inside of the hood better, a solid aqua/bluish color. The thickness and the fit were as expected."
4.0,"These socks are a comfortable fit for the ladies in our family, and for me (I wear a size 8 men's sneakers).<br /><br />I love the decorative patterns. The stitching looks good; but, when I turned the socks inside out, there were several socks with a couple of loose threads.<br /><br />The seams at the top of the toes do not bother me, but I can feel them rubbing on my toes occasionally when I wear these socks in my sneakers. They have not caused any noticeable marks on my skin at the end of the day after wearing these socks.<br /><br />The cuff regions of the sock are not binding and do not cause ridge marks at my lower legs.<br />So far, in just the past week, after wearing 3 pairs of socks on separate days and washing and drying them twice, the socks have stayed up on my calf regions.<br /><br />These socks do not provide me the warmth that I like when walking on my cold hardwood floors in the den early in the AM (with temperatures in the mid-50s), as they are not too thick. On the other hand, my feet don't sweat as much in these socks as they do in my thicker wool socks.<br /><br />As I walk on our hardwood floors, the soles of my feet don't get as good of a padding as I would like. On our carpet floors, the soles of my feet feel better (as does the bottom of my feet and lower back).<br />Because they are not too thick, I can easily slide into my slip-on shoes.<br /><br />Materials of the socks:<br />--- Merino wool 53%<br />--- Cotton 24%<br />--- Polyester 16%<br />--- Spandex 7%<br /><br />Washing instruction (printed on each paper band that encloses a pair of socks; socks themselves do not have instructions imprinted in the material):<br />--- Machine wash warm<br />-- Tumble dry with low heat<br />--- Do not bleach<br /><br />Overall, these are decent socks (thicker than the standard socks that I buy at a large mass merchandise store; but thinner than some of my wool socks that I wear during winter time) that I would enjoy using during the Fall/Spring season."
4.0,This one is alright but I like my other one I ordered with it yes it works as well so I'm not going to complain I very glad I ordered it  thanks
4.0,"Gets the job down, but it's a bit tight to put on!"
4.0,"These headbands are very cute. Very well made too. The fabric is soft and not too thick. The fabric is stretchy so it can fit a range of sizes. The stitching is great. No fraying at all. The colors are exactly how they appear on my laptop screen. The one thing that kept me from giving them a 5 star is that they are really big. I can fit them on my head, so I don't see me being able to use these for a newborn. They'd definitely be cute on a  toddler, but just too big for a baby. But for the price, you are definitely getting your money's worth. They are very nice headbands.<br />I received this product for a discounted price for reviewing purposes, but these opinions are my own."
4.0,Love this dress.  Would love one in every color
4.0,It is not the best fabric but fits good.
4.0,bought this item for my teenage daughter. it was priced right and very fashionable and the quality seems good for the price and it even came with an extra battery which is nice.
4.0,"This GeekSpark Deep Navy Solo Loop band was delivered to me in a day, was priced quite competitively, and fit and works perfectly.  Compared to the Apple Deep Navy Solo Loop band, the low price of the GeekSpark product allows me to buy five or more GeekSpark watch bands as compared to Apple's price for a similar product.  The only nit was that the Apple product color is a little deeper blue, and looked a bit ""richer"".  GeekSpark wins overall due to their great product and HUGE price savings, and it looks good too!"
4.0,Like the shirt length
4.0,"Do I like this jacket, hell yes I do. This jacket is sexy,comfortable, warm and affordable. I wear this when I want to dress casually or dress up alittle more no matter what I look good in this jacket. I had to take it off in 28 degree weather because it was so warm and what's ironic is that it's lightweight too. And for the price u can't beat it. The only bad things I have to say about it is that the material isn't that durable and I don't exactly like the bottom wait and but I can definitely deal with these small negative things because I like this jacket a lot and it turns heads when I wear it."
4.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing and this outfit fits great! Very flattering and shipping was faster than expected! The seams of the fabric aren't very durable, or i would've given this 5 stars. Overall, i am very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,I wasn’t 100% sure about the style of the dress but after receiving it I’m glad I got it. The fit is true to size and the dress is unique & looks cute on. The waist has elastic so you’re not dependent on the belt to keep it wrapped. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 Stars is because I’m not thrilled with the wide shoulders. I think it’s how it’s made to fit but I’d prefer a tighter fit.
4.0,"This dress was pretty and nice material but I'm top heavy 36g 10/12 pant with a belly , while the dress would've been flattering in belly area there wasn't enough room in top and already purchased xl the biggest size so sadly I had to return"
4.0,Adorable! Perfect size. However it would've been nice to get TWO earring backs rather than ONE..
4.0,Comfy & soft.
4.0,"I purchased this purse for my wife as a Christmas present!  Every where we go my wife gets compliments on her purse.  And your can literally put your head in it, thats a lot of room for your wife's stuff.  and yours!  Buy it!"
4.0,I received my pendants but no cabochons has showed up yet but according to the information they were supposed to arrive together
4.0,It worked for what I needed it for. It fit my daughter but will jot hold up to a wash.
4.0,It’s a little tight around the mouth<br />Neck is fine<br />Very warm
4.0,I keep ordering these because I love them. I wish they were a bit more resilient in the wash but just be careful when you wash them.
4.0,Nice and cute....
4.0,"The material feels a little cheap and the skirt is a tiny bit short, but pretty much what I expected. I don’t really have any complaints other than those."
4.0,"The watch was better than I expected especially at the price that I paid for it.  It made a great gift item,"
4.0,Great inexpensive watch that looks much more expensive.  Perfect for work when you still want to look great and don’t want to worry about damaging an expensive watch.
4.0,"It feels more polyester than cotton.<br />I love the look but after the first wash it will be too small. Fits more like a 16 and I got XXL,"
4.0,"Simple, but good products."
4.0,These glasses arrived quickly and fit great. The tint on the Lens are just right to shade your eyes from sun rays but not too dark to the point where everything is super dark. Haven't had a problem with the slipping off.
4.0,"They arrived super fast. The length came up the bottom of the knee cap. I was looking for above the knee cap, but these boots were fine. They are a little small for my, I could have done better with half size bigger, specially for when I wear the thick socks. Overall very good product for the money."
4.0,"Nice skirt, but it is see-through. Would fit a variety of sizes."
4.0,"Beautiful, just a little heavy, but still awesome!!"
4.0,Very beautiful shoe but run very small in size
4.0,"Fits very small, but overall nice shirt"
4.0,Pleasantly surprised. Good quality material and fits as expected.
4.0,If you have annoyingly dainty wrists this will not work for you. otherwise well made. Easy to install and all that junk. Just huge.
4.0,"With care, this light weight piece of jewelry compliments almost any occasion requiring accessories of dress."
4.0,"Shirts look great. Breathable fabric. length of the shirt from top to bottom is rather short, when you lift your arms up over your head your gut might pop out of the bottom of the shirt."
4.0,"looks great, feels great. ripped a little bit on the inside after hard, hard use, but im not sure any jacket would have survived. fits great too"
4.0,"Looks great and is very comfortable. Not the same quality as the original band, which you should expect considering the price. Nice band for what it is and what you pay."
4.0,"Really nice gloves for the price. They are soft, comfortable, and stylish. I also like that they cover my wrists.  They aren't great for texting though."
4.0,"The bottoms were not full coverage, but I really liked the top.  I'm super self conscious of my legs, so I just bought different bottoms. Overall, decent purchase."
4.0,"It fits well, but if you're worried about size, go one size up. We got the matching pants and it's super adorable."
4.0,"The band was received timely and fits a silver/white face Eddie Bauer field watch very nicely. Removal of the existing bracelet band was the most time consuming part since installation of the NATO band is quite easy. The only thing I wish was for roughly 1-1.5 more inches of band length. Buckle end to band end length is 10.75&#34;. A little more length would allow the loose strap end to loop back under the metal band holders in a sort of s-shape. Right now (on my wrist), there is not enough band to loop back but enought that it almost overlaps onto the face. Cutting the strap end by a 1/4&#34; may be the next adjustment however, the first buckle hole is just .75&#34; from the end so I don't want to shorten the loose strap end too much. The colors look like the website picture."
4.0,Seems well made. I'm happy with my purchase.
4.0,"I have fine, slippery hair.  Though I have not used this product during intense physical activity, it has worked perfectly for every-day use.<br />It is a little too tight for my liking, and gives me a slight headache if I wear it all day."
4.0,"The fit and comfort, not to mention style of these jeans are perfect.  Exactly what I was searching for!"
4.0,"It's warm but it's also small. It great when you're watching tv with alone or with a small group and you just want to keep warm. It's also thin so don't expect it to be super warm. But, LET'S GO BUCKS!"
4.0,Very nice earrings.  Thank you.
4.0,Nice beanies for the winter. The material is thick and soft. Very comfortable.
4.0,"They were all different, then again it is handmade, my only issue is 2 were thick 2 were thin, not sure if this was done on purpose or not, works for me though to have different sizes, but heads up to anyone ordering this is truly ""hand made"""
4.0,This dress is super cute! Decent fabric and seeing.
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my teen daughter. She loves to wear dresses in the summer months and this one is perfect for that. My daughter is 5'7&quot; and weighs about 130 pounds. She wears a medium to large in junior sizes and a small to medium in misses. I went by the measurements provided and selected a medium. We may have been able to get by on a small, but her cup size is a C and we have found that many dresses are too tight in that area. This one fits well on her. The length is long, but not to the floor. My picture doesn't show how long it is in on her, but it is similar to the model in the picture. The straps are adjustable. It requires a strapless bra to be worn. The dress itself is a basic, cotton knit dress. It flows nicely and hangs well. The quality is in the mid range. There were a few loose threads, but the seams are good.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own."
4.0,"The person I bought this for loved it and has not complained about any thing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, cute gift idea or for yourself!"
4.0,If you like old fashioned jewelry you will like this piece.  It’s lovely with a blue stone enclosed in bronze filigree and chain. Looks good on a light colored blouse.  M
4.0,nice socks not very thick if you want thick socks
4.0,Is volunteers purposes it's a really cute dress it's just not a good style on me and that's not the dressmakers fault. So it's basically a really long button up shirt with a very sheer fabric not sure that you can see through but it's just really thin and then it comes with a tie. If you don't have curves it's probably not the dress for you I just look like a hanger but I do like to wear it as a shirt underneath my overalls.
4.0,Really cute and comes with warranty but the problem is it’s 2 big and when you move your hands it cases the silver stuff on the side to press the button... so it always think I have something to say 🤦🏽‍♀️
4.0,"Snags easily. Other than that, very happy with jersey"
4.0,They're perfect. I'm 5'4&#34; and 108 lbs. Got the L/XL. Can't imagine fitting into anything smaller. They make floorwork sooo much easier.
4.0,It has some smell coming out and not easy return. So I have to keep it.
4.0,These are cute pjs but they were way small. I should have sized up 2 sizes. Thankfully they worked for pictures but his belly shows when he stands up. Sad he won’t be wearing them Christmas morning.
4.0,I bought these gloves for my brother who's a long time Harley rider. The quality is excellent. Super soft and comfortable. Well worth the reasonable price. They don't come with the small loops that help you pull the gloves to remove them. Small inconvenience.
4.0,"Great product. Would be five stars however it came with a piece broken off. It was east to glue back on, just an inconvenience."
4.0,"Is squat-proof but not sweet-proof. If you are as sweet y as I am, this legging doesn’t do anything for you to cover all the sweet"
4.0,"I purchased a couple &#34;Leading Star&#34; dresses similar to this one. This is a thin dress. The top area with elastic above the breasts is a little tight compared to similar ones sold. It's not a bad dress...it's &#34;okay&#34; and can accentuate some unflattering areas. It's not a huge issue for me but worth noting. It's not the best quality, but a good cheaper summer type dress."
4.0,"I would definitely recommend ordering a size down. I originally ordered this shirt for my boyfriend in a xl, however when it arrived we discovered that it fit more like an XXL. We ended up swapping shirts with one another and I wore it as an oversized t-shirt. The style was just as it appears on photos."
4.0,The dress is super cute just make sure you have some good undergarments because it’s the end and stretchy and will show all the imperfections
4.0,Fits a little snug. Terrifies all the men I sleep with. Win win.<br />Never snags on anything. One of my favorites.
4.0,comfy to wear anytime.
4.0,"They were not quite like the picture. Ok, though"
4.0,They were a little big for my 5 mos. preemie twins. I folded them up in the back that way it didn't cover the tops of their eyes and forehead.
4.0,I would size up unless you are looking for a clingy fit. The fabric is thin (which is what I wanted) and is particularly soft. Overall this product is exactly what I expected and wanted for the price.
4.0,"Color as expected, but fit a little small."
4.0,A little wobbly?!
4.0,Cute but nothing special
4.0,"My wife loved the look, the beads were just a little too big for between her toes"
4.0,Sheds a little. Otherwise great
4.0,"I have gotten compliments on them but they do seem a little cheaply made to me, although they are holding up well so far."
4.0,These things are super cool its just very hard to turn off
4.0,"Our daughter does like the white color, the pull on closure and the adjustable drawstring design of these Capri pants. She says her favorite features are the elastic waist, the styling of the articulated knees and the front and back pockets. She likes that she can place her phone, keys, wallet, and other personal items in the pockets as she works out. Our daughter says these Yoga pants fit her pretty well, are comfortable to wear, and easy to put on and take off as needed.<br />She says she likes that the pants are really stretchy, but she doesn’t like that they are a bit see- through. Other than that, she does like the overall quality of these loose work-out pants."
4.0,"Actually fit great until I washed it. Ugh. Still fits, but now shorter than I'm comfortable wearing."
4.0,"Being a 38DD I have an issue with bathing suit tops, namely finding one that fits right and provides good coverage; seems like everything now a days is meant to show &#34;more skin&#34;.  The top (XXL) actually fits really well, there is a bit of &#34;side boob&#34; but not a horrible amount. Definitely a great purchase.  I was actually surprised to see that the bottom fit well also, a little big, which is expected, but it fit."
4.0,Well constructed hat but it was a little snug - I got a large and my hat size is 7 5/8.
4.0,True to size mean it fit. Not loose at all
4.0,"I like them, however they are very delicate. One ripped in the first wash..."
4.0,"Run's small. Very cute, the price was far for the quality, the important thing was receiving it in a day, perfect."
4.0,"It’s transparent! Great to wear over a bikini for a pool party or something, but that’s it!  I bought it to wear to a wedding (and obviously won’t be), but I really like it so I’ll keep it for a beach day."
4.0,"I am 5'6 and 155. I fit a size 12 on average. This swimsuit fits between a 12-16, but is sold as fitting 10-12. The torso is slightly long, but with the ruching, it's barely noticeable. I wish the cups sat just a tad lower. But overall it's really comfy and complementing. Perfect swimsuit for someone like me, there to play in the sand with my one year old daughter and not have to worry about wearing additional coverups. I really like it a lot. 4.5 stars"
4.0,Love the gloves and the design. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the fit of the thumb. Needs a lot of wiggle to get the thumb into the glove. The lining in the thumb doesn't quite have a comfortable feel.
4.0,"Nice material. Fits as expected but then again, its hard to go wrong with shorts."
4.0,"I haven't worn it yet, but looks exactly as pictured, and even came with a replacement battery! The watch band is rubbery, which I don't mind, it's comfortable. Good addition to my fashion watch collection, can't beat the price!"
4.0,I'm very happy with my Buxton Organizer. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that the checkbook cover was not leather. It really is a very well made wallet/organizer. Not regrets buying it at all!
4.0,Fun to have a choice of colors. Overall these are very good but occasionally they do not stay fastened to the Fitbit.
4.0,"Nice shirt- would recommend based on unique design, construction, and general fit. I found a little large. This shirt is very much as you would imagine based on what you see here online.<br /><br />Sizing: I am a little over 5'10 and 150lbs. I wear  31x32 jeans and I'm slightly narrow across the shoulders. Seeing as this was a 'slim fit' and I typically wear as US medium, that is what I ordered. This shirt fit a little bit (not a lot) large.. particularly in its width, compared with what I would have expected (see pictures to decide for yourself). In fact I may return my shirt and get a US small instead.<br /><br />Material/ texture: I have read some reviews saying it is 'scratchy'. While it isn't a soft cotton or bamboo t-shirt type material, this shirt did not bother me or feel rough at all. I know this is subjective thing, but I did not notice or have any issue with this at all. It is light weight and won't do a lot to keep you warm (though I don't imagine that is the primary purpose most people are buying this for anyway).<br /><br />Care: Note that it is linen-type fabric- as such it will wrinkle easily and require either an iron or steamer to avoid those wrinkles/ lines."
4.0,My kiddo loves these!
4.0,Most needed to be fixed upon receiving the price and reviews helped with that
4.0,This dress is super cute. But it runs small. I'm bummed  because it's really cute. I would size up. For reference I'm 5'1 38C and 137lbs.
4.0,"However it arrived broken, one of the connections was loose in the box. I was able to repair it with a needle nose pliers. And it is great looking so I wanted it NOW!  All's good"
4.0,Runs small. Form fitting. Fairly thin. Good Iight hoodie.
4.0,I ordered three different colors all in the same size and the fit was consistent.  The only thing I don't like about these tops is the material. The polyester will be too hot for an 85 degree day. Good for the office though.
4.0,It looks very nice. It fits a little big.
4.0,"Love this suit. I bought it because it offers Full sun protection for my child who hates sunblock. I also had a problem with other styles/ tops not staying in place and exposing the back when swimming. This suit is a win-win, quicker sunblock prep only for exposed areas and less hassle for both of us.<br /><br />My child is 46” tall and about 60 lbs. The only sizing issue was that the sleeves were 4 inches too long and the legs about an inch too long.<br /><br />*if you found this review helpful, please click the helpful button so that others may see it as well.

4.0,"I bought this item for a Men watch, but this is a little big than the woman, I have to use this for my wife watch that was damaged too."
4.0,Good fit.  I wear them under shorts and seams are not too tight.  I love the padding... placed well.
4.0,These are very nice earrings for the price.  Just what I wanted for everyday wear.  I would have given it 5 stars if the backs had been a better quality..
4.0,"This is a nice shirt, though the material is much heavier than I expected."
4.0,"A bit baggier up top then expected, and longer rouche strings. But Overall very cute with sandals and heels!"
4.0,"I bought this for my teenage sons pirate costume. The quality is great and it looks really good, but it is kind of snug. The only issue is that it does run kind of small, which is why I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"Bought this hat and gloves for my husband who was stationed in Ft. Knox, Kentucky.  Kept him warm then and keeps him warm now at football games."
4.0,"I bought this item to wear on a cruise vacation this fall. The shirt is a bit snug, a little tighter than size would suggest but not terrible.<br />The material reminds me of a swim suit material.<br />I like that the bra in built in considering it's mostly backless. I like back cut out design."
4.0,I liked the face coverings.  The fabric is soft snd the filters fit nicely in the pockets.  I gave them a four because my husband did not like them.  He liked the filters but thought the fabric was too thick and they fit too tight.  I will stretch them out a little and have him try them again.
4.0,"Been wearing them for about 2 weeks now. I bought the 9-10 size and using them on a dress shoe. They were a bit wide around the toes, so needed to be trimmed. the arch lost a little bit of the support, but still works. I should have opted for the 3.3mm. Overall though, still pretty good.It did lessen the foot pain whenever I wear these pair of shoes."
4.0,I am 6'tall 150lbs<br />(Tall and skinny)<br />Got medium<br />They are a just a tad bit too small
4.0,Love the sweater and the price. Only issue is runs a little small.
4.0,very cute order at ease.
4.0,"Ordered for my son who is fairly skinny, but the Small was way too big for him and not sure XS will work either. Probably partially my fault for trying to fit him into a men's size, but I had no luck finding anything else he was interested in.  Other than the wrong size, it seems like a good product. I will probably hang on to it and he can use it in the next year or two."
4.0,These are pretty much what you would expect for the price.  The platforms are solid.  I can walk with confidence in these shoes.  Run pretty much true to size.
4.0,Cute and really fun. Fit pretty well but you do get what you pay for. I will be surprised if they last a few months.  They are really thin. I normally wear a med or large. I should have ordered the XL in these pants.
4.0,BEAUTIFUL DRESS BUT RUNS A TAD BIT BIG
4.0,Love the feel or the material fits nice and looks great
4.0,beautiful and cheap... I mean inexpensive... great quality and it hangs beautifully on my neck... very happy with this purchase
4.0,"They were beautiful, loved them!! They had a little white mark on the back for some reason, like it hit something too hard, but other than that, they were perff!"
4.0,This is a really nice beach dress. Perfect wear for a beach or cruise getaway (whenever it is that cruises come back). I’ve used it for the beach and for the pool.<br /><br />It is not the best fabric but it is good enough to wear a bathing suit underneath.
4.0,these are cute but unfortunately were too small for me. i loved how fast it came and the side slits are super cute.
4.0,"This computer bag is nice for my daughter heading to college. She wasn't sure what to think about it at first, but ended up liking it. Its a little big, but has plenty room for more than just the computer. All in all, it serves the purpose with style."
4.0,"I'm gifting the Medium shirt to my small friend and ordering a Large for me. I am a medium but the arm holes were too high and honestly a bit snugger than is comfortable; it fit like a small so I was surprised, but shopping on line has these challenges. The quailty of the shirt is great."
4.0,"Kind of a cheap quality, but look great. Got quite a few compliments on them."
4.0,"Had to pull up some Saw Briar and Poison Oak.  So far no streaks, scratches or errors."
4.0,Great design love the material was just a little bit too small but I can still wear it just a snug fit around my arms
4.0,We bought this watch as a gift to my son. When we opened the package I must say we were pleasantly surprised. It is a beautiful watch.  The craftsmanship is very nice. Better than  what I expected for the cheap price.  Read directions carefully for winding instructions.
4.0,"Cute and not too &#34;cheap&#34; looking. A little thicker of a metal, It was delivered faster than I thought too thanks!"
4.0,Mesh cart bag fits nicely on my speed cart (not Sun Mountain)  Will be handy for all the extra items that don't fit in my golf bag.  Seller very responsive when item was not delivered.  They responded right away and issue was resolved right away.  Thank you!
4.0,"fit well, looks great,.  Fits great on my pandora charms."
4.0,Hangs nicely
4.0,"My 11 year old daughter loves this headband and wears it every chance she gets. I love how the company makes a variety of colors so she was able to get to match her uniform for practice and game days. It fits snug, but not too tight."
4.0,"It's OK-- just not quite what I'd hoped for. Not super soft. Fits a little tighter across bottom vs top (I'm also small up top, so that might be part of it). Kept it and wear it occasionally."
4.0,"My daughter and I were looking for modest swimsuits, and these were a beautiful choice. When you go to put it on, make sure the ruffly part ends up on your chest and not your back, cause it is a bit confusing. We got 3 different colors, and none of them really matched the photos. This one was really light peach, not so much pink, and I wouldn't recommend the color, unless maybe the wearer has very dark skin. For my daughter it was too close to the color of her skin, and she wished she had picked the darker pink, or a blue or green. It was helpful that some of the other reviewers took their own photos, since those often showed true color. The built-in shorts under the skirt are nice too. The only negative is that the underwires come out easily in the wash, but leaving them out doesn't seem to affect how they work. The suits fit as expected if you look at the chart they provide and go by the US measurements. My size 4 teenage daughter was an extra large by the Asian sizing, but the chart showed us what to order."
4.0,Can't beat it for the price. Looks expensive on my wrist. Only thing is the clasp a bit chinsey and thin. Glad I chose this one though.
4.0,"Let's keep this simple. I wear a medium, I brought a medium. It fit.. Its very comfortable the quality is great. Is it worth $30+?? No. I brought 2 on prime day for half that price."
4.0,Love it but its a bit small
4.0,"Very nice skirt. Quality of fabric is great ( heavy but airy matte satin). Beware that the color is not exactly what you might think. It says red, but really looks more on the orange side.<br />Overall happy with the purchase!"
4.0,Fits fine looks great have to see how durable it is.
4.0,"It's a very cute top, a little itchy. I'm 5'2 about 165 pounds mostly in my butt in thighs. I ordered a large, maybe next time I would get the XL."
4.0,Wife thought it was beautiful for Xmas gift. I think it could have been larger. Chain is short and delicate.
4.0,I wasn't paying attention to the fact it was a padded bra! I don't particularly like padded bras! But! It fits like its suppose to and I hate sending things back! So I've learned to deal with it and am now more careful when ordering online now. If it wasn't padded I'd of given it a 5 star rating.
4.0,"Super cómodo, les encanto a mi sobrina"
4.0,"Shirt is good quality, but it definitely shrunk after the first wash. If you're a Smedium like me, better to go M than S."
4.0,These run a bit small so I sent back the first pair I ordered and ordered the next size up.
4.0,"These fit fine, altho with a cut out palm, it flares out at the wrist. The fingers are quite long, so forget doing anything requiring dexterity like opening a beer can. I did some dry brush layers of acrylic paint (tan, brown, pinkish, unbleached titanium, etc)  over the very bright green to better approximate real flesh tones-- now they have a more realistic look."
4.0,The chain was really thick but all you have to do is change it out with another one.
4.0,Yes these really do work. I suffer from dry eye and screen time contributes to it but when i wear these i have much less issues.
4.0,"I had informed the seller that the clasp was difficult as there is no clasp on the main chan but rather a clasp on both ends of the attached extender chain. The result is that the extender chain must be left on hanging down even though it is not being used as there is no other way to clasp the chain by itself.  The seller immediately responded to my concern, refunded me 40% of the cost and informed me that they would discuss the issue with the manufacturer.  I appreciate the effort that the seller made to rectify the situation and, in any event, my daughter absolutely loves her necklace."
4.0,"It's a little longer than I was hoping for, so I might be pinning it up a little (like my picture) but I still think it's very pretty. It's comfy, stretchy and heavy so it stays down. I'm about 5'3- 5'4 and about 185-190lbs and Im a 38-40 D (curvy body). I ordered a XLG. It's loose at the waist. But I feel like a large might have been to tight for my liking around the waist and breast area.  Also it has pockets!! I don't remember reading about that detail so that was a nice surprise!"
4.0,This is an adorable shoe!  Very pretty embroidery. Its moderately comfortable although I've only just worn at home a little bit.  I dont think these have enough support for all day or long walks.  I'm an 8.5 and 40 was a bit too big. Im debating whether to exchange the shoe for a 39 or just wear socks. Shoes are a bit wider than im used to.
4.0,"Knowing that these run small, I ordered an XL but it was still a bit snug.  Nothing that a good -5 pounds would not solve. :D<br />I am only 5'4&#34; and cut four inches off before re-hemming.  The length was then perfect.  Love the fabric and the pockets."
4.0,It arrived on time and wasn't damaged.
4.0,"Cute chiffon cover-up. Nice to wear over a bathing suit or dressed up. Washes well. Fits as expected. Not a huge fan of the butterfly pattern myself, but it's nicely done in general."
4.0,My daughter loved the bright color and the fit was comfortable for extended time in the water.
4.0,Nice inexpensive clutch when you need a going out bag in a pinch good to take with you when you travel holds just want I need when I go out wallet keys phone and lipstick . I plan on ordering other colors
4.0,It's a very nice top. I know it's supposed to fit loose but a 2X is too loose. I'm a plus size women large busted. I want additional colors but definitely a 1X next time.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:80381133f8ee9c682f1350ca2c60e000]] I order the gloves in XL and they fit really well. I use them when working with resin and so far have had no issues. My only concern is that they arrives in a smashed box. So I had to find a different way to store them since the box was useless. Other than that they give the job done and I would order them again.
4.0,Exactly as advertised. Good value.
4.0,"This is a nice mask. It doesn't have adjustable ear loops, but still fits nicely."
4.0,this band is what was listed on website and came very fast. quick and easy. nice purchase. i'd buy from them again.
4.0,GREAT FIT AND LOOK. COULD BREATHE A LITTLE BETTER BUT OVERALL VERY NICE.
4.0,Works well at keeping pants from falling down :-)
4.0,The dress is really gorgeous. The material is really soft and the fit is very flattering. The colors are more vibrant than they appear online.
4.0,I love this dress! It is so cute and comfortable. 4 stars because some thread on the seam was already coming out when it arrived but you get what you pay for right?
4.0,Looking for bold piece this is it I have large breast it lays nice
4.0,"Cute and good quality for the price. Within two weeks, though, the thread by the zipper starting pulling away and now I have a small hole. Also, the ‘texture’ on the fabric is spotty and rubbing off."
4.0,"A little bit bigger than expected, otherwise great product."
4.0,"Color and pattern were as pretty as expected.  I only used it for three of the configurations (a couple of the illustrations would probably only be useful for bank robbers.) It arrived promptly, was well packaged, and price was reasonable.  I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,"For cz, it's absolutely beautiful.  A solid piece."
4.0,Loved the fit.  The colors are a bit  dull
4.0,Silky smooth and the lavender eyes really stand out.
4.0,Good looking tie
4.0,Nice feel.  A little large but comfy.
4.0,"The masks look very nice. One is all metal and has rhinestones attached. I found it very comfortable, and thought it was the more masculine of the two masks. The other mask has a base of hard plastic with two metal pieces attached to it, with rhinestones and glitter. I thought this one was more feminine. The plastic piece is what goes against your face and members of my household tried it on and found it uncomfortable against their eyes."
4.0,"I bought them because I like them a lot in the picture, of course! I should had paid more attention to the specifications... they are really too small, like for a little girl, not really my taste, any way, great quality."
4.0,"Good buy poor choice of color, I ended up with two ties of the same color...:("
4.0,Loved the material and colors.....just way too small.
4.0,"it's ok, its ok its ok its ok blah blah blah this is stupid this is stupid this is stupid"
4.0,"I like the case but am disappointed it isn't like the other versions I've bought.  This one is not hard like the s6 and 6p ones I have.  This silicone version is nice and it is full coverage BUT the fit is slightly loose.  Basically, if you are used to Bear Motions other cases, this one is different as it's silicone.  Cutouts are def perfect though."
4.0,The shirt is very soft but it is see through. You have to wear a shirt under it.
4.0,"Nice material. Cute style.  I really wanted this to work.  The bust area was too small but a bigger size would be too big in the body. Ordered medium. 36D, 160 lbs."
4.0,"Unfortunately the size just said kids small, and that's too vague to get the right size for my 5yr old.  I got a small hoping it would fit but it's more like a teen small.  So thankfully since it was for my daughter she is wearing it as a long night shirt until she grows into it.  She still LOVES it!!!"
4.0,It ended up being too big for me so I gave it to my sister. Shipped quickly.
4.0,"The waistband is very tight. It’s very lightweight. I wouldn’t put it in the washing machine, which is why I’m rating 4 stars."
4.0,"They are cute, but really only good for a few wears before they start looking faded and worn. It worked for us since they were holiday and we only planned to wear them a few times. Definitely won’t work for hand me downs, and probably wouldn’t buy for regular wear. For the price and what we needed them for they worked."
4.0,"I like it and I think ill be wearing it a lot . I ordered this for summer coz I'm veiled and it gets too hot,so I try to keep it to one layer . Dress pattern is pretty and bright but the finishing was terrible. Quality is less than I expected but its ok since its not see through and its only for $7.  I wear a medium and ordered large to feel comfortable in it and it ran a little bit too wide by the waist,length is perfect though.so I gave it a quick wash and high heat in the dryer and it actually shrunk a bit . It fits perfectly now. Its not wrinkle free so you will need to dry it and hang it right away."
4.0,"It is kind of sloppy, but over a lightweight shirt, it's nice an warm for winter days."
4.0,"Amo los elefantes y su significado como símbolo, y cuando encontré este collar lo pedí como regalo. Luce hermoso y delicado, viene en una caja pequeña así que sería un buen obsequio. La calidad del material se siente resistente pero solo el tiempo dirá si es real o no. Por lo pronto, estoy satisfecha con el producto."
4.0,just toooooo small for what i was looking for and I didnt' like the quality of the inside liner.
4.0,"Beautiful! My only gripe is that the bracelet loosens too easily and slides, but if my wrist was a touch larger I doubt it would be a problem. Otherwise, beautiful beetle, nice, clear lucite, well woven band."
4.0,Nice gloves.  Even though I measured the size of my palm and bought the appropriate size they are much larger than I needed.
4.0,"Worked up a sweat trying to put it on! With some adjustments in the ribbon it fit well! The ribbon is low quality, but pulled as tight as they are, the wrinkles are absent. I ordered a medium, my bust is 36 inches, waist is 29-30, and hips are 37 inches. I am a bit chubby in my belly so I want to start waist training with this. So far just from the get-go I notice how nicely it squeezes me, and it is crazy comfortable. Definitely wont be difficult to wear this for long periods of time, besides of course the putting on. Maybe it's just because im a rookie at clasping these things but it was a huge hassle haha. Above and below the buttons/clasps are an odd little folding/damaged area, seems to be because there is a section of fabric that surpasses the boning. Wearing pants slightly above the bottom as well as having underboob hides it, and for the price it is definitely not a big issue. Seems to be pretty good buy that'll at least hold me over long enough to buy one of those custom designed corsets. We all know how crazy expensive that is haha! Overall definitely look at sizing and for slightly bigger measurements you can simply loosen the ribbon. :)"
4.0,"This dress is very pretty and exactly as pictured. It is a little weird putting it on the very first time because the area for your head to go through is more narrow than I expected but wasn’t a big deal since the straps are stretchy. I’m usually a large but bought both a large and x-large just in case. I ended up choosing the x-large— the body of the dress fits the same as a large but since I have broader shoulders the x-large felt a little more comfortable around the neck. Like others are saying I’m pretty cautious about the quality of the stitching. First photo is of the large and you can see a straight unbroken line in the center of the dress right under the bust, but in the second photo I’m wearing the x-large I decided to keep and it’s already lost sequins (line is broken). I’ll have to figure out how to sew it down somehow. Otherwise makes for a really great party dress for a good price— I’ll just come back home with less beads and sequins. Oh, well."
4.0,"This is a very lovely product, the bag is a very nice plus, the shawl itself is beautiful to look at and quite large when unfolded. The embroidery is very appealing, easy to read, I enjoy the inclusion of traditional Jewish and Christian scripture. For some reason the fabric dyes (?) have a discernable smell. I would wash the bag and shawl by hand with Woolite or similar, and then hang outside to dry in fresh air and sunshine. Otherwise a lovely prayer shawl in every way."
4.0,a bit tight on space but definitely cute
4.0,"If they offered nude and a blacker black I wouldn't order anything else. Stay up all day and I can get 15 wears out of a pair (with washing, of course) before they ladder or snag. Not super glossy, but definitely everyday wear for me."
4.0,FascinatorBrunch
4.0,"I read the reviews and carefully considered the size.  I measured carefully but they were still to big.  I am exchanging them for a smaller size, because they are well made and I really like them overall.  The adjustable straps don't really shrink them down all that much.  I wear a 20 in women's pants and I like to have a little give, so I ordered a 3X and they were waaaaay to big!"
4.0,The color is off but my daughter said it’s still was pretty.
4.0,little snug for my big head but I like is nonetheless. when fully adjusted out it doesn't fit on my head like a baseball cap should.
4.0,"I was very happy to find a yellow leotard with built-in skirt. The shipping time was better than expected. My daughter looked stunning and this leotard really made her stand out. It has a shiny gloss that doesn't even show in the picture, which make it even nicer.<br />The only reason for giving 4 stars is that it's really only a one or two time use. Th threads have started coming out and it was only worn for 6 hours. It looks a little ragged. It MUST be hand washed and that &#34;shine&#34; fades.<br />Another thing to consider (which never even crossed my mind) ... this leotard is a little 'sheer and revealing' under stage lights."
4.0,"Perfect fit, and reasonable durability.  A year in the chlorine pools swimming laps, and elastic just starting to give."
4.0,Very thin but I like it
4.0,"Nice for the price work well at gym workouts. Would recommend for the price.Would buy again, can't beat the price for the quality of the product!"
4.0,Good for a costume but need to order a size larger than normal.
4.0,It’s look casual good
4.0,"Fits well, ad its super cute!<br /><br />LARGE CON - it is cheaply made and the literally the first time I put it on the white threading was coming apart and exposed. Not sure if it will survive if I wear it again. Afraid to put it in washing machine."
4.0,"This is a great product for a DD cup tall and/or long waisted individual since it provides enough support for running, & provides a flattering fit under clothing, with a similar fit to underwire only without the discomfort of underwire & wicks away sweat to a greater degree than similar sports bras. The colors are great for wearing under a racerback tank.  The racerback feature prevents straps from sliding off shoulders.  Would have given it 5 stars except that if you are of average size, unless you're anorexic, taller than 5'-5&#34;, or long waisted, the circumferential bottom band is slightly too long in length which causes it to roll up.  Since the band itself is thin, this isn't visible under normal clothing, so it's not a deal buster.  Only other issue is that when washed, the pads fold in half and become dislocated within the cup of the bra which causes them to have to be re-adjusted prior to wearing but that's a minor price to pay since this can be easily done and they are removable.  Would be great to see it offered in a 100% cotton product which would be even more comfortable."
4.0,"Cute earrings.  Not super fancy, but nice for a casual day or night out."
4.0,This is nice.  I like mermaids.  Customer service was fantastic when I originally received something I didn't order.
4.0,"Great looking,  not as thin as it looks. Band could be longer for better comfort"
4.0,"Love these! They look and fit great and are very durable! I don't like spending a lot on sunglasses because I break and lose them so easily.  I had bought a few pairs, but I always go back to these since they look the best! Update I have had these for over a year now! They are still my go to glasses and haven't broke! Well worth the money."
4.0,This product seems good so far
4.0,Band st bottom very narrow. Difficult to take off. Use as pjs. Love the color and fit. Very comfortable.
4.0,Absolutely love this item...it did shed a little so I used a lint roller and it was perfect. Very elegant for the price.
4.0,Love the quality and design however it runs very small and a bit short.  I am 5’9” usually a Med/large...ordered this in XL and glad I did.
4.0,Keeps the earrings where I can find hem easily
4.0,Looked like the real thing
4.0,"I like it but it is too large, will have to return"
4.0,I like this dress. I like the fabric. It’s comfortable. I like the pockets.
4.0,Runs a little sm
4.0,only downside is its kind of heavy for a belly button ring
4.0,"The dress was very beautiful. Like other reviewers have said, the dress runs small. I am a size 14 and brought a size 18 and it fit “snuggly”. Also, if you’re big chested you may have a problem with the breast padding on the dress. It was like tiny cones sitting on the chest. I had to make a slit on the inside of the dress and take them out. Having said all that, the dress was worth the money. If I would have had the time to get the dress altered, it would have been perfect."
4.0,"I'm 5'8"" and these are long enough!! They go right to my ankle with a slight slouch at the ankle. They are also true to size. Although definitely not sweat pants. These pants are very light weight/thin. Not at all sweat pants. They are comfortable and I do like them because I can put on a nice top and a pair of flats and still look good and be comfortable at work. Im a little disappointed they're not heavier, but I still recommend."
4.0,Pretty and the right length.
4.0,Very easy to slip on my feet.
4.0,The pink pair is slightly bigger than the other two.
4.0,"I really liked this bracelet but it did not fit my wrist. It was tight, so I am giving it as a gift for someone at Christmas time."
4.0,Wayy smaller than I thought
4.0,Wore to a wedding. Super cute
4.0,Nice earrings. A good deal.
4.0,"The socks are super cute and the colors are perfect.  They were slightly different in size, but that doesn't really bother me"
4.0,Love this product. I got it on sale and wasn’t expecting much but I was very surprised by the quality of this set.
4.0,Great quality but not truly newborn size. Will probably be about 6 months old before my baby girl can wear them.
4.0,"Cute for what I needed, a little flimsy but the price point was perfect."
4.0,This is great and it was exactly as described my only issue was it is a little to big for my wrist and I have to wear it a little higher than I like on my arm. But I get compliments all the time.
4.0,"I am always on the search for a wallet that is small and will fit in our too-small lady pockets on our jeans. This wallet is exactly what I need! It is small, foldable, and perfect for on-the-go activities and small purses or pockets. I would have preferred that it be a color other than pink, but overall the quality seems good and nothing has broken."
4.0,I love this skirt. 4 stars because it runs big on the waist. But lovely fabric and just the right amount of compression.
4.0,Works as expected.  A bit annoying to set each time.  I think it worth it over the more expensive hands free bras you have to completely undress for.  But I found putting the flange in my normal bra works just as well.
4.0,"I like this, it is nice 👌👍"
4.0,Fun for costume.
4.0,"Overall: Not bad but Not great<br />The dress MOSTLY fits as expected. The fabric is somewhat thick, sorta like thinner swimsuit material. The skirt portion has a nice shape when on but cinches in a little above the waist/below the bust which does not suit my body type. If you're heavier chested, the fabric will definitely stretch a bit over the bust. I ordered a large and am med/small chested and the fabric stretched just a tad. The pattern was as pictured but the burgundy was a little darker than shown online. I'm not unhappy with the purchase, especially since it arrived so quickly, but I probably wouldn't have chosen it if I had seen it in person."
4.0,Product and fit
4.0,Great pattern and colors. Got compliments right away. Nylon pant. Fits well; a little large. Hard to match that pink though.
4.0,Wasn't the one he wanted but definitely likes it.
4.0,"I purchased this bag in the mud color and it is a gorgeous color! Slightly different than what they show on the site...The bag I received, the color is a little darker than what they show you but regardless it still is a beautiful color. ( and yes they do have a disclaimer on the site that does state that the color might be a little different than what you see)  The bag is super beautiful and very well made... you would seriously think it's a genuine leather bag! The quality of the bag, the stitching the hardware everything seems very high quality including the lining inside... definitely no complaints about the quality of the bag. The only disappointment I have is that it is much smaller than what appears to be online. (And yes they do give you the dimensions of the bag however when you are looking at the pictures the bag does appear to be larger than it actually is) I happen to be a big bag person so I was expecting it to be somewhat larger than what it is, but still, all in all I do like it and I will keep it. And yes there is a odor as I have read in some of the other reviews, it smells like fuel!  LOL  but I put it outside in my porch to air it out, hopefully that'll help defuse the odor. So yes I do recommend purchasing this bag it is a beautiful bag it's very well made, very good quality for the price, definitely. Like I said I just wish it was bigger....but overall I am a fan!! :)"
4.0,I'm 5'2 and the tights were lower than as seen in the pictures ~1 inch above the knee. I have some pretty thick thighs and none of the fat hanged like a muffin top near the top.<br /><br />There is no front or back of the tights (a.k.a. this is where your heels go area) which means it's one size fits all.<br /><br />The color is slightly more of lemon yellow than the pictures. Stripes are not perfect.
4.0,Very useful and functional
4.0,Looks great but saving for Christmas so not sure how it works yet. My husband thought it was so cool I had to buy another for him
4.0,The grillz fit well
4.0,"As I always do with PattyBoutik, I ordered a size up (medium). The dress fit except it was still tight in the sleeves. The scallop neckline was really nice giving it some detail. Unfortunately, the dress only had lining in the bust so it was a little clingy and see through. It's too bad the lining didn't continue down to provide smoothness and subtle shaping. Length on me was at the knee and the teal color was perfect. For the price, it's a lovely dress, but I couldn't justify keeping it and opted for something else for my upcoming occasion."
4.0,Bigger than the description. According to description measurements this dress should have been too tight and it was in fact too big. Still cute though.
4.0,"These fit just as expected and had room to stretch or shrink depending upon needs. It is very comfortable and is something that gets worn more often than not. It looks sexy and leaves all the &#34;Fun&#34; areas exposed and ready for play time. I have liked them so much that I now own 3.<br /><br />It has held up nicely to multiple washes and still looks good. For the price, I don't think you can go wrong. I give it a 4 star because of the outer lace, It is kind of itchy at first but goes away after a few washes and softens up."
4.0,These are by far the most convenient pair of readers yet.
4.0,Decent for the price. Sleeve colors aren't as bright as the picture all in all it's nice
4.0,"I received these ear pins...........they were very nice, but smaller than I expected. I still like them, and would recommend them to a friend."
4.0,"Bought this for my mother because she is currently in her dress phase. My mother is 5’3 and she wears XL (sizes runs small on here). It fitted her perfectly, but it was wayyyy too long. Lucky she know how to alter dresses, she made it into a length that she wanted. But, all of that the dress was pretty and she was really satisfy, thank you."
4.0,"Perfect for what I needed it for. I followed the reviews and ordered a small. It’s still a little big on me also but that’s how I need it to be for it’s purpose. I’m 5’2, 170."
4.0,"I love these boots, the are perfect for a casual look, and look great inside your jeans or a legging. The mix between the leather and the suede is perfect, and the heal, not too high not too low. I have them in black and grey, and the grey one dont come with the suede."
4.0,Adorable Tshirt dress. I wear a size 12 and got a large and it doesn't fit too tight in the wrong spots. Great coverage in the stomach area. I wear a 38C and the bust size fits but if larger order a size up. Wear a slip in case you bend over.
4.0,"Ahhh man - I really wanted more of a purse than a giant bag like this.  It would be a good gym bag or carry on piece for flying.  I'm going to keep it because it was so difficult to find - but I wish it was about half the size.  The material, style and branding is FABULOUS!!  Dang it."
4.0,Easy to install. Easy to put on and tuck under so the end doesn't flip out like most watch bands. Holds up well even when working on various projects.
4.0,"It feels a bit small around the hips and and back, but it's made up for in the fit for the &#34;package&#34;, keeps everything separated instead of mashed in like with traditional briefs."
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, but otherwise a good replica. It shipped very fast and I love wearing it around."
4.0,A nice dress. A little thin material. But tolerable<br />Good buy.
4.0,Was hoping for a less stiff type of cap with good airflow. Ponytail openings don’t include the really high opening that some other caps do. It’s well made.
4.0,The black is peeling a little after about 5 months but we do like these a lot.
4.0,"could be the best shoe , but too narrow. had to return."
4.0,"larger face than expected, but so far it works fine"
4.0,Looks nice and is warm. It is a little loose but is still comfortable to wear.
4.0,Nice dress but fabric is cheap and flimsy. I was still able to pull it off.
4.0,"Bigger than anticipated, but great earrings."
4.0,A little see through but really cute ❤️
4.0,"Super soft. Very comfortable. A bit big on me, I'm 5' 3&quot; with pant size 8/10."
4.0,Had to cut open areas where my buttons are to turn on & off phinem
4.0,They work great for our pe classes
4.0,"A bit larger than I had anticipated, but I do really like them. They are a bit heavy and tend to slide down my nose at times."
4.0,As described. Simple and pretty.
4.0,"It fits kin of big, but imma keep to see if it shrink when wash... It is so comfortable"
4.0,"My daughter loves these.  The pin is a little long, but that is a good space for the silicone protector we use to help keep the backing on."
4.0,I love the design but the extra piece of wallet that extends past the pockets to create a center space for cash makes it a bit too wide for a pocket. Hard to tell from the photo before purchase.
4.0,"The waist is really tight but the calf area is a bit loose (which is odd because I have large calves). That being said, they are not uncomfortably tight. The pocket is just big enough to fit an older iPhone perfectly. But if really try, you can squeeze a much larger phone in there, it's just not very easy. Overall, I really like the feel of them. They are soft and comfy. Definitely no problem with them being remotely see through. I've worn them a few time walking, and they seem very durable so far."
4.0,Fits real good but face is really to big on the mask to match up to your face
4.0,"Order a size up.  The material is medium thickness, and is VERY soft.  The garment doesn't hang very well after putting it on.  The pockets are almost parallel with the bottom seam.  But it is a pretty color."
4.0,"Comfy lining, seems to be well-made (but if they fall apart quickly I'll post an update; more likely I will lose them in a few months because that's what I do with gloves and hats), slick-looking. The leather is soft and seems to be good quality. Good value!"
4.0,The dress was great but it was too small.  Sorry
4.0,Nice shirt.  Cotton material was kinda stiff out of the box.  Hopefully it'll soften up after a couple of washings
4.0,These are nice readers with an attractive case and cleaning cloth.  Fit well and I am wearing them right now.  Probably will get anther pair when I lose these.
4.0,"This is a roomy backpack to carry all of your purse items plus a few more things.  I tend to take a lot of drink bottles, compact food items and protein bars with me and this has enough room to get it all in.  It is easy to get into, also."
4.0,"Im 5 foot 5 135lbs 32d size 5 pants and the medium fit the top half fantastically. The bottoms were another story, way too small. A large or extra large would have fit better for me on the bottom half. I'm still very pleased with the purchase, great material and very cute. I just wish I could have gotten the bottoms in a larger size."
4.0,"I'm about 5 9' and I thought that I would get a large because the reviews said it was slightly smaller. (But I usually get a medium) I am satisfied with this, but I thought it would be a little longer. It barley covers my butt. However If you just wear leggings it should be fine."
4.0,Its very pretty & colorful. Its a lot smaller then what I thought & not cotton. Would make a great gift bag for a birthday party or a over night bag. Great for younger kids.
4.0,They fit large but I got a larger size so she can have a longer wear out of them. Over all love them
4.0,Nice hoodie but not very heavy.
4.0,Love the look just on the small side
4.0,OK produvt
4.0,fit 5 month old great
4.0,I ordered 4 pairs for my husband and we kept one pair and sent the other two back. There was nothing wrong with the other pairs but when I ordered them I didn't think they were going to be a typical/ standard BDU short. I thought they would have been a little shorter like he likes and have a little more style to them. After we washed them they softened up a lot and he likes to wear them.
4.0,"I have gotten compliments every where I have worn this dress, It is flattering, very pretty and comfortable.  It's the right length and the material is light and soft.  I like it so much I have ordered more of them.  I really like that it has pockets and is comfortable across the chest area.  The straps are adjustable.  Great deal for me."
4.0,The wig is reasonably made but takes some significant styling to get the side burns right.  Would be much easier to wear if these were built into the hairpiece from the git go
4.0,"It’s really soft, but super staticky. The color is also more subdued than in the picture. It’s more terra cotta red than wine red. It’s a gift, and I know she’ll still love it, but the color difference definitely threw me a bit."
4.0,"I ordered the wrong size, otherwise the item looked great.  I'll be ordering the correct size in a couple days."
4.0,Super cute; a little short for my conch so I had to squish my ear to get it in but it screwed on very easily and is staying nice and tight. The longer one (5 rhinestones) was bigger than I expected so it didn’t fit but maybe I’ll just have to get another part of my ear pierced where it can fit!<br /><br />I Will update my review when my tragus piercing on my other ear heals enough to swap out that earring.
4.0,Was quality product
4.0,"I love this design but, unfortunately, the tank was much smaller than I expected and I have never been able to wear it. Hopefully someday after I lose weight!"
4.0,"Good quality and soft leather, the lock is not easy to release when you wearing it. So far so good"
4.0,"nice pair of stylish glasses.  Definitely inferior to the Quay ones I also got, but still very nice and cheap"
4.0,Great purse. Just the right size for travel. Fits my big Note 5 just fine. Had slots for credit cards. The smell is not the best and I couldn't get rid of it but it wasn't bad enough to send it back.
4.0,"It’s amazing  color bag  ,I like it  but it’s too large I think it’s more suitable for moms who have kids 😊"
4.0,I ordered this for my niece and added a sweet note through Amazon’s gift options telling her it’s a locket so she can always carry her Lovie’s love around with her. The note wasn’t in the gift. Kinda took away from it. Cute necklace crappy customer service.
4.0,Very pretty for my roommate for christmas. The only bad thing was that it took a while to ship so I wasn't able to give them to her until after christmas break.
4.0,bought this as a gift - it arrived as expected and looks to be of fine quality.
4.0,"These Andyshi women's briefs are made of 95% cotton and 5% spandex. They are soft, stretchy, medium coverage, and comfortable. They leave no undergarment lines and they don’t ride up or down they stay in place. The downside is they run one size small and not high waist fits a few inches below the belly button."
4.0,"Not as clear as picture, but still neat looking"
4.0,"Nice, looks great with black!"
4.0,Overall I liked these pants. I will be returning them however for a size large .the thigh area runs small so be careful .the ankle part goes past ankle so no high waters great . I hope I have helped someone on your decision to purchase or not .good luck 👍
4.0,It does tarnish that’s the only bad thing about it..
4.0,"This was a great gift! It's very soft and stylish. I would have liked the ruffles to be a little more dramating, but other than that, it was great!"
4.0,good but larger than expected
4.0,This dress was beautiful but I just wasn't quite comfortable in it. The sleeves were a little tight. And the top didn't work for me. The skirt looked better with the petticoat I bought. Also the skirt does have sewn in pleats and the fabric was stretchy.
4.0,"Other than it flies up when doing water aerobics, I love the suit"
4.0,It was just want I wanted! It fits great! The only thing I ddnt like was the material is super rough and cheap feeling but other than that I’d order it again!!!
4.0,I love this belt and cannot wait to wear it again.  It goes with so many things. Thank you!
4.0,Love that it is lite wight and comfortable. I felt very confident wearing this top
4.0,I didnt look close enough at the measurements. Assumed with that price it would be bigger
4.0,Very happy so far  They are a Xmas gift.  Can't for see any problems.  Will probably order another pair after the holidays
4.0,Beautiful bracelet. Looks like the real thing. Very satisfied
4.0,Good for large luggage.
4.0,"I like it, but it's not my favorite piece of costume.  Nonetheless, it'll dress up any number of things and the price can't be beat."
4.0,"Good quality. It came with all the adidas tags on it too, seems legit 👍"
4.0,This is a nice soft sweatshirt.  I gave it a 4 due to the size. It fits like an X-large.  Also very long. I’d go a size down.
4.0,"This thing is gigantic and thick which might be a deterrent for some, but it feels really nice and looks sharp"
4.0,"great scrunch bottoms - shows a lot but not as radical as some so you can wear it anywhere these days.  like a lot of these, if you try to hide some cheek by pulling them down your crack will show, but that seems to be common these days.  only complaint is the purple we bought is not as shown but a brighter hot pink-purple.  else we'd give them 5 stars.  they are not see through and are lined with a thin black material."
4.0,Soft but a little smaller than I expected. I still wear it because it's awesome.
4.0,It's exactly what I thought it would be like. Alot of fun😁
4.0,better than a mask
4.0,I like these for working out. The tummy control is a good height. The material is the soft kind that keeps you dry. The pocket is nice . The only thing is they are really short but I do like that they don’t roll up when working out. But they are not squat proof! Super see through
4.0,"I love this necklace, but it's really heavy. I can only wear it for a little while before I feel neck strain."
4.0,"I am a medium sized guy... I've bought this band for a Vostoc Amphibia (18mm strap band width). I've purchased this type of band before for my previous Vostocs (I gave those Vostocs as gifts (this is a great automatic for someone whom you think would like join the crew of collecting watches)). The length has something to be admired. However, the material feels amazing. 4 stars."
4.0,"I really wish there were options for what designs to get, or at least pick between different assortments. I REALLY don't like pink and this came with a lot of pink. And a putrid green on a few pairs. But they're really soft and fit well (despite being a bit big, but that's pretty normal for socks) and there are enough pairs without really bad color combos to make it worth it. Besides, I can give the pink ones to my mom. She loves pink."
4.0,"I wanted to love this item, the stripes were so cute!  Unfortunately, it was just too short for my long torso, but fear not, fellow tall ladies: there are lots of other one pieces on Amazon that fit longer torsos.  For anyone who can fit in this one, enjoy! 4 stars because I tried on several options from Amazon and this one's fabric appeared to be the lowest quality, which is fine if you are wearing this for cute look."
4.0,"The fit was spot on. I am 5’5”, 155lbs, size 8/10. The medium was a great fit, but would be too tight in the sleeves if I had layered anything more than a shirt underneath. If the arms are rolled up I couldn’t wear anything with long sleeves at all. This jacket looked as shown BUT really looks bad if the sleeves are not folded up. As you can see in my photos there’s no cuff at the end of the arms. Just doesn’t look good worn with sleeves down. Generally, it’s a nice light weight jacket."
4.0,Nice look but the material is very thin.  Can see the outline of everything.  Dries rally fast
4.0,Ordered a small but had to return as it was too big. Straps aren’t adjustable and the bottoms were also on the larger side. The fabric was thick and felt really nice. Overall a well made bikini.
4.0,Fit good but it was really short Iam 5'7
4.0,I lobe em bit I need to wear shorts underneath because you can see through them. They are a bit small. Id order one size up if possibile. Very cool and super punk! Rock on!!
4.0,"these are really made for men, not women. they are extremely oversized on me, but look good on men friends. BUT they offer AMAZING eye protection and coverage. love the blue color, but one warning- when left in a car, in sunglass holder they STILL heated up, and could NOT be worn til they cooled down! Fun styling"
4.0,Very low rise
4.0,Great for night rides on the motorcycle and for sneak attacks on unsuspecting friends.  I recommend this headgear.  Wear it proudly.
4.0,I was a little disappointed with the fabric thought it would be much softer and  cuddly.  I’m sure after washing and using a fabric softener I’m sure it will be great.
4.0,Really nice and its long!
4.0,"It's cute and arrived very quickly! The cord is a little cheap, but for the price, that's just fine."
4.0,"Looks pretty on my hand,  I am a size 8, but when I wore it, it felt a tiny bit tighter than other size 8 rings. Also, the ring itself, not the jewel on top, has mini jewels."
4.0,This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and I was very pleased with it and I'm sure she will be to.<br />Thank you
4.0,"Boots look great! The fur is great quality and the boots fold out nicely. I'm 8.5 and got 9, as recommended. one foot is perfect and the other is slightly longer.  Nothing an insole can't fix. The width is the same.  I'm keeping"
4.0,Wore to a military event. Got so many compliments on it. Simple. Comfortable material. My only complaint was the length but I am 5’2 so to be expected but other than that LOVED it.
4.0,"These are flattering and the crop is quite flattering to most legs-even thick ones like mine. However, this appears to be a line that does vanity sizing, so I would order at least 1 size down. Usually I am a solid 4 in most pants but a 4 is a bit too big for me."
4.0,"My daughter loves these shoes and they are very cute. I love that with the pink and navy, and all the rainbow dots on the shoes, that they go with almost every outfit she wears to school. She wears them nearly every day, and they have held up fairly well throughout the school year. The toes are a little rubbed through, but that is more of a function of my daughter being a toe walker than the shoes themselves. I do wish that the toe area was a little more reinforced, though. Overall, nice pair of shoes. Fit as expected."
4.0,"I love the color and comfort. It resists wrinkles well. However, the shirt began falling apart after about 6 washings. The fabric is thin and the fabric around the buttons frays easily."
4.0,They look good. Of a sturdy build. Very small on my head
4.0,This dress is super comfy but the shoulder straps are a little loose. Overall this dress is flattering and comfy
4.0,okay a little too big but perfect for presents
4.0,Very beautiful earrings especially for the price a little too big though.
4.0,"It is serving me well in warm weather.  Wish it had a little elasticity, but it is full enough to not pose a significant problem in so far as comfort is concerned when I am in bed.  Only summer gown I have found with long sleeves."
4.0,"This is a great flattering suit, even if you have a little belly.  The first time I wore it the strap came un-stitched but I was able to hand stitch it back together.  Also, the inside of the suit where the seam is is pretty itchy, but it's very comfortable other than that."
4.0,"Nice, but bigger than i thought...."
4.0,"I am always on the lookout to find appropriately-sized gifts for this little Bangledeshi girl I am sponsoring. World Vision has a rule that gifts must fit inside a no larger than 6 x 9"" padded envelope, a royal pain but I have to live with it.<br />This is a very cute little bag that JUST squeezes into such an envelope although I had to open up the outside wrapper and remove some styrofoam sheets put into the various compartments.<br /><br />I have no idea how well-made it is since obviously I have not used it, but it is CUTE!  I've also seen versions with dogs and pigs instead of cats, but I'm not sure how well those would go over sent to a probably Moslem child in a Moslem  country.<br />Someone who does not have to deal with that cultural issue might also look at these others, esp since the cat pack is running very low.<br /><br />I think she'll like it.,"
4.0,They are comfortable and easy to wash.
4.0,"The silicone is squishy and stretchable  These pieces rest on the back of my ears, making them slightly uncomfortable at times. But they are adjustable; able to slide up and down the arm of your glasses, so that same issue may not be everyone else's."
4.0,I wasn’t looking to spend a arm and a leg for a one time use. It came very quickly and it looks to be made of good quality. I would buy it again
4.0,"This dress is cute. Very light material like a  stretchy T shirt. Colors are a bit brighter than what is on screen. Shoulders fit well, chest good, waist  too big, length at knee.  My only complaint is that the inside waist seams are very scratchy. If  it was a but more snug it might not move around and itch.<br />For reference I got an XL, am 5'8"" 170 lbs. Shoulders fit just right so a large would have been too tight."
4.0,I love this shoe but it's a bit tight in which I can deal with - only because I have narrow feet and they are not extremely tight...but do order a size up.
4.0,They’re pretty and big but can make you hot.
4.0,I love the dress very soft I order the navy with yellow flowers but not true to size I needed a large. I ordered a medium. But it’s worth the 19.99
4.0,Loved them good price
4.0,"Def took forever to come but for the price is a nice suit, im 5.2&#34;, 155lbs, chose a xl cause im a 36dd and it fits good, had to take out the padding so I will feel more comfortable but fits.<br />Im giving it 4 stars cause the material is somehow cheap and the back doesn't have a clip like the picture shows so is tricky to put in and out and I have the feeling that the straps will break soon, let's see how long it last, might change ny review later on"
4.0,"I saw that there was medical ones in a lot of the lot(medical student!!) some NSFW ones(idm it,I would’ve happily given them out as gag gifts!!)<br />But the ones I got are lovely. Alittle disappointed I didn’t get the ones everyone else said they got as stated above a couple times but I do love mine. Will be ordering again and see if maybe I can get the ones they got"
4.0,"The dress is very beautiful. Material is kind of thin, but comfortable and still looks nice in my opinion. Only problem is the dress is a little too short since I am 5'10&#34;."
4.0,It's a little bigger then i had expected but it is beautiful and my daughter loves it
4.0,I was looking for a loose comfortably cute shirt she doesn't like tight things and has huge breasts so this was a fit and she loves it
4.0,"Awesome purchase, light weight, breathable, perfect for all seasons! Will buy more"
4.0,needed something leopard for a costume and this worked great.  Long in the back and the sleeves were just a little above wrists.
4.0,"Cute shoes, the top fabric seems thin but I'll have to wait and see how well they hold up."
4.0,"I got an offer and got this almost for free, nobody asked me to write a review.<br /><br />I have been using it for over a week, and I like it!"
4.0,Fit is good.  They looked as advertised.  I really like the style for the price.
4.0,I love how slim this wallet is but at the same time it's so slim I can't fit many cards into it.
4.0,A little hard for my husband to ge in his foot
4.0,"These are adorable, however, they are bigger than the average ear. Will probably use as a necklace charm"
4.0,"I was looking to replace the leather bands of my watch, and after doing some research, I saw that this brand was apparently known for its quality, so I ordered a set. After receiving it, I understand why the reviews are positive. The band is definitely attractive, with the natural/classic leather texture and the precise red stitching. The leather also feels soft, giving it a somewhat broken-in feel, rather than an uncomfortable rigidity. In these aspects, it closely resembles the stylings of my original band, so it looks like an easily compatible replacement. However, it doesn't necessarily match the quality of my original set. First of all, I ordered the 20 mm width, but it almost felt like 21 mm because it was difficult to squeeze it in between my watch's lugs (which are definitely 20 mm). Secondly, the buckle feels a bit cheap because it is noticeably thinner and somewhat plasticky feeling than my original one. I wish I could swap out the Hirsch one with my original, but alas, the original is not removable. Lastly, this band is not as thick as my original one, so it doesn't feel as premium or supple. Overall, I really do like this Hirsch band, but I don't think it is as luxurious as it is made out to be (admittedly, my original watch band is a Burberry, but it's a very ""affordable"" luxury watch, so I am not unfairly comparing this Hirsch brand with something extravagant)."
4.0,Seems like it will work well but too big. I wear a size large in shirts and ordered a large. I will order a medium
4.0,"I love how it looked when I recived it, but it was poorly made, the wings fell off within a few days. If they would've made a different clasp to prevent any dangling jelwery from falling off or could guarantee a money back replacement policy, I would definitely buy it again."
4.0,I love them!  I originally bought a different brand that had 6 pairs in one.  I threw them in the trash and bought the Scholls which I had worn out my old ones.
4.0,"Took a bit longer to arrive and was lost for a bit, but when it finally arrived, I was pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"These were super difficult to install on my wayfarer-type sunglasses, but once they were on I never worried about them coming off. I'd rather be able to install and uninstall at will, but otherwise they are great."
4.0,"I'm 6'7&#34; about 215 slim and I wanted a great looking jacket that was also warm and lightweight. This is the one. Fits well in the sleeves and right over my hip, yet isn't too long. It's not skin tight and would have plenty of room if you're a little heavier than I am. Deep Pockets lined with very fine fleece. Adjusts at the waists with elastic band. Adjustable cuffs. Keep in mind the color is a little darker than the picture. Like a granite or grey stone.<br /><br />Update:  went from 5 to 4 stars ONLY because the only thing I can really complain about is the fleece lining in the jacket - when you wear long sleeves the friction makes it tough to put on and take off without the sleeves bunching."
4.0,Could have a litle more horizontal stretch. Feels slightly constricted in the chest area. I wear a women's medium (US) but I bought an extra large (because it was coming from Asia and their sizes are smaller) and it was still a little close in the bust area. Great color and shine though.
4.0,this product is good tasting. The reason I gave it four stars is because the package came open(resealed with tape) and the nucita's boxes broken open...I dont know how or where but that's not right
4.0,"I absolutely love the fabric it feels so good, but what I don’t like is it runs very small a small is extra small to me and a large is more like a medium. Other than that I loved it. And they have pockets lol."
4.0,It's really epic. My son loves it.
4.0,Pretty but delicate.
4.0,I am 5.7 120 lbs and I bought a small
4.0,Linda pero muy pequeña
4.0,"I'm 5'7, it's not as long as the picture shows, but it's pretty and fits great.. thus was for a 2016 cruise.  I still have it in my collection"
4.0,The color was just like the picture. The material is a poly/nylon blend and the shirt isnt warm but it is very cute!
4.0,"These are very comfortable and super soft. I got the xl because that’s what was suggested,  they were too big on the tummy area but I washed them and they are better. I normally wear a medium and I could trade them for at least large but I do not want them to be tight, I wanted a little more of a lounge look. Also I am short, 5’3” and they are a little “blousy” at the ankle but I’m good with it. They are super stretchy"
4.0,Look like higher quality without the price
4.0,"I bought this for a wedding and it wasn't as fancy as I was hoping. However I loved the dress so I kept it for other occasions. It's a really thick and heavy material, will be a great spring/fall dress :)"
4.0,Cute dress. Long enough. Lightweight non stretch fabric - would have liked knit but it hangs nicely anyways. Shorter in front and longer in back.
4.0,"These went on easy and lasted a long time.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they are supposed to be arm bands, but they only went about half way around my arm and since there aren't two of the same, it made an imperfect scene.  I didn't care too much for what I was doing, but you might."
4.0,"This is a really long suit, but it fits my midsection well. I am 5' 8&#34;, 180lb and my breasts hardly fit. I have to keep readjusting them unless I am laying perfectly flat. It is very cute and keeps my belly flat, but a piece of the inside was also flipped out when it was sewn, so I'll be sending it back as mine was defective."
4.0,it ok not as elegant as I would have like but it pass
4.0,It was a tad shorter than I expected. But it was still cute. I got compliments. I’m 5’8”
4.0,Like others I used the size chart to calculate height/length! I'm 5'8.5&#34; and got the XXL. I probably could've gotten the L or XL and been fine as this skirt is a little longer than I'd prefer (I step on the hem sometimes). It flows really well and looks more expensive than it is. I will probably take my engagement photos in this skirt. One complaint is that this skirt is extremely staticky so make sure you have dryer sheets on hand.
4.0,Even though it's a bit bigger than expected it's very comfortable so im here keeping it😊
4.0,"There's no sticky rubber to keep the stockings up, BUT the elastic at the top is very tight so on me it creates a muffin top effect. I rolled it under the knees and they worked better."
4.0,More color options needed and the laces are not necessary the shoes stays on quite well.
4.0,It's a great top. The embroidery is very delicate
4.0,"Nice running tights, but sizing is definitely super small.  Order bigger by a size for sure.  I’m a 31x32 pants guy and ordered the mediums.  I am stuffed in them like a sausage.  Definitely buying large next time."
4.0,Got it for my son's ski trip and he was happy with how warm he stayed.
4.0,Nicely constructed and lightweight.  I only wish it had credit card slots.
4.0,No Problem ! Looks Great !!!
4.0,"Very soft, run on the bigger side, and theyre pretty long... Im 5'6"" and theyre almost below my knees"
4.0,I would give 5 stars if the elastic didn't break so easily.
4.0,"Length is good but alot is reviews say order larger,  but I don't think that was necessary."
4.0,"The wallet I requested is a good product so far.<br />They pack it in a box, with a protective paper, something simple but adequate for the price of the product.<br />The wallet looks very good, seems to be made with very good quality standards, I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"Four-stars for a products that meets but doesn't exceed expectation. It has a pretty solid feel, definitely not a cheap mask from the local Halloween shop. The fit isn't phenomenal...I have a fairly large head, and the bottom portion of the cheek area still sort of sits fairly far from my face. I also wish the nose was a bit more covering...it literally covers 1.5 nostrils!<br /><br />I'd overall recommend this mask."
4.0,"Very cute shorts, purchased for my granddaughter and she loves them."
4.0,"I put this on my keys and carry it everywhere with me.  Large enough to hold a few cards and a little cash.  My only complaint is that the way the keychain is set up, it tugs the zipper open.  I wish the chain was attached a different way."
4.0,Wished it had come in a shorter length.  Was able to shorten it.
4.0,I ordered these because I have some straight leg jeans that won't stay inside my boots.  They are nice and wide and the clips are tight.  I put the clips in front of the ankles to keep them from rubbing.  Love these little items.
4.0,These are a great and I buy them for my classroom. They’re just a bit hard to pull apart. I’m sure I’ll be ordering them again.
4.0,Purchased as a gift.  I like the saying on the back of the key ring and the tree of life on the front.
4.0,"Cute, covers upper arms nicely  I hate my arms!). Fits as expected ; loose and comfy ( Im 5'2 and bra size 34DD).<br />After second wash I noticed pilling - otherwise would have been 5 star's"
4.0,"I have to say, if I am being honest this outfit is cute but it doesn’t look exactly like the picture showed. The buttons on ours are further apart and the dress doesn’t flow out like it shows. Good value and the fit is fine otherwise."
4.0,"It is a good quality gi that is standing up well to washing and rolling.  I just don’t think my rear end is the right size for the gi, right fit."
4.0,Amazing price.  Looks very shiny and will act beautifully as costume jewelry.  Of course it won't fool anyone as being the real thing but it is very well made and looks flawless.
4.0,I love how soft it is ... but I am a big woman and these are massive.  Buy smaller than normal.  I bought what i wear  XL..... yeah way to big.
4.0,"***UPDATE***<br />Bought these in June and in August, the glue has melted along the bottom of the frame and has started to spread. I left them in my car, like I do with all of my San glasses and have never had this issue."
4.0,Nice dress but kinda long for me 5”5
4.0,"Fit as expected! I am petite and have a 34D chest, and surprisingly a size small (size 4?) fit. I bought the white color to match a white skirt that I wore to an all white party."
4.0,Beautiful style but it was shipped all folded up and those folds do not come out easily...causing it to look a bit frumpy.
4.0,"Wish the hands were black, so that they are easier to see.  But a great watch and it looks great as well."
4.0,"Feels great on my tiny head and is easy to breathe through. However, it came nowhere close to fitting my husband's full beard.  Definitely works best with a chin."
4.0,5’0” 115lb This small dress was too big for me but that’s not uncommon. Would look beautiful on a larger human being
4.0,Nice and good fit 2XL. Only complaint is the draw string on hoodie does not have a casing so when you tighten the hoodie it is out of place.
4.0,"This is a very close copy of the Edwardian jewelry style.  Fake pearls always look a bit fake, but this wasn't a big detriment to the overall look of the piece.  It will be worn with a historic costume."
4.0,Waistband is fairly stretchy. I am a size 10 and it fit well enough.
4.0,"I was so happy with this purchase, and I NEVER buy clothes online. I'm a 34J and it's almost impossible to find a suit that fits under $100. I also haven't worn a suit that didn't have underwire in it since I was a teenager, but this suit surprisingly did the job. I bought a 1x. I'm 5'3 160lbs. Most of my weight is in my tummy area from having a baby and my boobs. I will tell you I did have some side boob action but with the amount of cleavage in this suit it actually looked sexy. My husband loved it! It was worth the price."
4.0,"This ring has a very nice design and it fits comfortably, but I must have measured my finger wrong because it does not fit the finger I wanted it on, but I moved it over a finger and it fits good. The back of the ring has a hollow at the top that can fit a foam earplug if you want to as well."
4.0,Very tight in the chest and too short. Beautiful print and style.
4.0,"It's very pretty, but not what I was expecting. Earrings are real small, bracelet is oversize, ring is kinda flimsy, nice necklace."
4.0,"The material is exactly what I hoped it would be, I just wish it was tighter around my armpit area. With the back being so open and myself being apart of the ibtc…(32C) 🤣 it’s loose at the top of my arms. I closed the back but only in the middle (so it created two holes instead of one big one) and it fit PERFECTLY. Overall I love this dress. I’ll definitely be wearing it again for any kind of formal event."
4.0,Just as described however the material is super hard
4.0,"Pretty good sunglasses. The mirroring is good and the tint is dark enough without being too dark. The hinges are metal and seem to work well, though the screw can come loose sometimes. My only complaint is that the arms pinch the tops of my ears at times. Overall, good sunglasses at an awesome price."
4.0,Good item considering the price.
4.0,It's well made....I am 5'5&#34; and 125 lbs. Ordered a Medium and the waist is a bit snug. I'm 26&#34; around. Afraid the next size would be too big
4.0,Nice feel to it.
4.0,"I love it! Bought to remember all of the fur babies I have lost through the years. Although its beautiful, I don't think it's worth the $54.99 price tag."
4.0,Helps reduce the chance of fogging. It can be tricky to not overdue the amount of spray that goes on and sometimes having too much on their can also impair vision as it wants to get foggy.
4.0,"The material is of decent quality material, i thought it would be a little bit more stretchy. It fits a little bit too snug around the belly area, so i should probably have bought a size bigger."
4.0,This is a heavier top. Real comfortable and buttons  are a nice touch. Nice for casual with jeans or with slacks for work. I also have purchased in short sleeves in multiple colors.
4.0,"Feels very durable, bit of a tight fit under the spring arms on my Pebble, but no big deal once it was all together"
4.0,I got so many compliments on my adorable little lady Gizmo costume at burning man! It’s very cute and exceptionally warm. The fit is flattering on my petite 5 ft frame- not too big or small. Only complaint is that I needed to use a safety pin to keep the area around the chin cinched together tighter so that the ears/hood didn’t flop back down over my head. Easy fix though! Looks great with tall furry boots!
4.0,"I love this tunic top so much that I bought it in several colors! If you're like me and you like simple, solid colored tops that can easily be mixed and matched, or you love tops that pair well with leggings this top is for you! Once I find a style that I can wear with different outfits I fall in love! I also like things that are comfy but neat. I'm 5'6&#34; and 160lbs, curvy with a 36C bust, just to help you get an idea of how this might fit. This tunic is true to size (I ordered a Large). The material is very flowy and stretchy so it drapes perfectly and doesn't cling to any imperfections. The back hem lands just at the back of the thigh and the front, which is a little shorted lands just slightly below the top of my thigh. Very nice quality and easy to dress up or down. I would recommend this top to every lady! It's a great Go To top whether you need to just run errands or need a top for a dinner party. It works for everything, is comfy and looks great on any body type!"
4.0,This dress was a little less playful than I expected it to be.  It is beautiful and fit well.  Thank you to Amazon for providing gorgeous dresses in extended sizes!
4.0,plenty of room  for 3 or 4 days
4.0,"Really cute top, but the cold shoulder cutouts are  too large for my taste.  You really need to wear a cami underneath or your bra will show, a lot."
4.0,"The way the dress is designed,  the surged or seamed side is is face out. Unfortunately the surge lines are not straight and it's very obvious when you wear the dress the &#34;right way&#34;. I flipped the dress inside out and cut the tag out of the skirt. When worn this way the dress is very flattering, I feel beautiful in it. A heads up, this is made a a thick tee-shirt material."
4.0,Cute and will work perfectly for what I need.
4.0,Almost as comfy as adidas sweat pants. Would buy again.
4.0,"Slight bubbling on the frames but other than that... such a steal for under two dollars! I see now they jacked up the prices to nine dollars. But still a good deal since now these glasses are prime vs. it took mine over 2 months to get to the US from China back in Summer 2019. Designer inspired, sturdy, and don't mind if they get broke/lost since they were so cheap. Wish I knew the prices were going to quadruple and I would have bought multiple pairs."
4.0,"Finding a supportive, affordable and comfortable sports bra is quite the challenge. This bra fits the bill and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,I would prefer a different material.  Husband likes it very much.  We will see how they hold up after washing!
4.0,Only comes with one. It’s a bit misleading as most come with 2. But it’s good quality and beautiful!
4.0,"This is a cute dress. The length is great, the material is nice, and it has decent quality construction. Many reviews state that this dress is either way too big or too tight. From what I can tell, based on the reviews, the dark colored dresses run small and the white/light colored dresses run big. I ordered the black floral in large (I usually wear a large or medium). It is a very pretty dress, however, it was way too tight in the chest (I am not busty) and over the stomach area. It is a printed material so when it stretches you can see the white from the underside through the black print. I decided to return it and purchase one of the lighter colored dresses in a size up. I am hoping the the new dress will have a more slouchy look. I will update this review as soon as it arrives. For reference I am 5'-2"" tall, 150Lbs, 36B."
4.0,Slight adjustment needed by the hips for me.
4.0,Great suit for the money the sleeves<br />Could be at least 3 inches longer
4.0,I love the way the jacket looks and feels. Tne one negative? It's a little snug. Buy a size larger than you usually do and you'll be happy you did.
4.0,Nice to change the look of my watch. Easy to attach to my watch.
4.0,"This headband is super cute! Colors are bright and fun and it fits well, even on an adult head. I have a large head and it stayed put throughout the event. My only issue- which is why I gave it 4 stars- is the gold trim that spirals up the horn came undone and unraveled by the end of the night. It looks like the only superglue the ends of the string to the horn, so I just re-wrapped it and superglued it more securely and it’s fine! If that doesn’t bother you, then consider this a FIVE STAR review! For the price, it’s definitely a good deal and great for any unicorn costume or outfit!"
4.0,Its a bit big.. but I love it..
4.0,One almost always needs at least a sweater when going for a walk in San Francisco.
4.0,The bag reminds me of those bags retailers take cash to deposit at the bank. I should have picked a different color
4.0,"Vest was quality work, very nice. Shirt and skirt very adjustable lighter material."
4.0,Comfortable but light
4.0,These fit perfectly. The fabric is good too.
4.0,Son loved it. Mask on hat was little too big. I was concerned about it being to small since my son has a big head and hoodies and hats usually don't fit him but this one was little big.
4.0,Got this for the wife. One star less because it seems really difficult to get the sock very clean (not sure if it is the material). Sock itself is super durable and hoping it lasts a while.
4.0,Awesome for taller person. Fully lined cuffs can be folded back or left down as shown in model photo if you have longer than average arms.
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34;, 160, usually wear a size 8-10 and a medium fits perfectly.  It's cute with leggings and a scarf for winter.  I love how it's fitted around the bust and ribs.  I'm deducting one star because the fabric wrinkles easily."
4.0,"Such a gorgeous necklace! Beautiful, vibrant yellow color. The downside is that it’s pretty heavy. I wish it was slightly lighter, but I’m still really pleased. I bought it for family photos, but I like it so much that I’m wearing it for other occasions too."
4.0,Most comfortable jeans I've owned back pocket were a little too far apart but I wear long shirts anyways so that didn't matter as its going to cover them anyways. But I love them alot considering buying me another pair in a smaller size I'm between sizes 18 and 20 and got a size 20 and after wearing them they stretched out but after i washed and dried them they shrunk a little. So think they will workout fine but next time I'll will order the 18 instead cause I don't like my pants to fit baggy
4.0,Fits fine but the color was not blue.  It was coral green.
4.0,"My daughter absolutely loves this outfit and jacket. Washes well, the furry jacket of course doesn't look the same after washing, but still soft and cute!"
4.0,My son loved it! Great gift
4.0,I ordered the one with unicorns and rainbows but they sent the one with unicorns and flowers. I also ordered the hot pink one and they sent the light pink one. My granddaughters love them so I'm not going to return them.
4.0,love this skirt but way too small i'm a size 16 and it's more for a size 9 or 10 and i bought it a size 2xl i really wanted it no elastic band on the skirt
4.0,"We, like many others, searched and researched the various sources for these cheap party gifts.  Our arrived quickly and none were broken.  They fit well on me, and a little loose on my fianc&eacute;. I can see how the lens might easily pop out but seems easy to fix.  It was a pretty even mix of all colors too."
4.0,Liked the print and the stretchy fabric.  I didn’t like the split on the skirt as I had to keep pulling it closed when seated.
4.0,This was purchased as an anniversary gift for my wife who has worn tie dye all her life. She absolutely loved it. Sweatshirt fit my wife well. Fit guide worked well for ordering.
4.0,The cotton fabric on these boxer briefs are pretty comfortable.  The fit is larger than expected so fits me pretty loose even after a wash as you can see from the pic. The crouch area is not constricting so I wear it to sleep during california evening weather without feeling too hot. I got the black color so didn't notice the see through effect as some reviewers mention. Hope it's not see through as I posted the pics.
4.0,"The keychain is fine, although beware that the print and color are not exactly as shown"
4.0,Bout what I expected. Light weight comfortable. Can see them breaking in a few months tho.
4.0,Kinda feel like i could have made this myself...
4.0,Due to the size discrepancy for online clothes I am only giving this 4 stars.<br /><br />My wife wears a L but I had to order an XL to ensure a proper fit.<br /><br />These are very comfortable and fit my wife great with the larger size. The fabric and workmanship appear very good.<br /><br />Coloring is true to form and only time will tell how well these hold up.
4.0,"Comfortable slip on with good arch support inserts . However arch support inserts are thick, especially in toe area. Had to replace with heel/arch supports that are only half the length of supports that come with shoes. 2 sets come with shoes. May be able to simply cut supports in half also."
4.0,"Cute, just for short time outing"
4.0,"Socks are very cute but do run somewhat large (my daughter has thicker legs/calves so these work well for her around the ankles, but the feet part are too big)....still happy with purchase.  Like the grips on bottom since my daughter stands a lot and is starting to walk."
4.0,Beautiful dress!! Beautifully made!! I just wish it was a bit smaller!!! True sizzle 2 won't fit on this dress!!! :(
4.0,"Love the sweater, but the fit isn't true to size.  I would suggest purchasing one size larger than you would normally wear."
4.0,"This necklace is super cute, but when it arrived, it was all sticky. I'ave read other reviews about the hearts not being center, mine is centered."
4.0,"This was supposed to be for a child but it’s too big , very cute though"
4.0,"I like them a lot! These pants have a shorts-style liner, but the rest of the leg is quite transparent. They are perfect for an evening at home or a familiar date. For most work-places they will not fit within the dress code."
4.0,I love it ! It adorable on! I’m 5’2 130lbs and a med will do just fine. I wish there were other colors to chose from.
4.0,"it's okay, more stop-sign red than I expected"
4.0,"If this sweater had pockets, I'd live in it."
4.0,My grandson loves pandas! I had to get this for him.  I washed it prior to giving it to him because it smelled like vinegar.  I washed in cold water.  I put it in the dryer on delicate and I pulled it out before it was completely dry.  Since it is angift I was hoping that it would look like new.  It was pretty wrinkled.  Anyhow... he still liked it because it's a panda.
4.0,I like the look of all 3 pairs. The redness came from forcing the post into my regular sized earring hole. Ouch.
4.0,A bit stretchy. A few strings loose on top but can totally be fixed. Not as fitted as shown in pictures but still a nice dress.
4.0,These palazzo are stylish and comfortable to wear. It is good choice if you are going for a formal or casual look so a quite versatile and good addition to your wardrobe. The material of cloth is good and hold the size and shape after the laundries.
4.0,"It fits nicely, the length is as described, the color is a bit more faded than I expected but still looks good. It is a casual look but, because of the color (burgundy), it can be dressed up with a necklace."
4.0,"Loved them! They're a tiny bit snug, but I guess thats not a bad thing when you're walking into a steam room."
4.0,This was my halloween sheriff outfit - I loved it. The quality is not bad and it fit me very well. It is definitely a sexy look and most likely you will need to put a shirt or small top under to cover the chest area a bit.
4.0,My 9 year old daughter lived this gift for Christmas. It’s too large for her to wear right now which is disappointing. The large is very large.
4.0,It fits well just thought it would be a little bit looser  Other than that very nice
4.0,✌️
4.0,"I ordered a 2X and they were easy to put on, they feel silky smooth, they give great coverage in the front BUT with every move they slide off the backside AND I don’t have an abundance back there 😆 so not sure why its such an awkward fit."
4.0,Other than being a little tight the shoes are gorgeous! The are perfect with my wedding dress!
4.0,"Color is a much brighter orange than shown on picture, but I liked it! Dress is long & flowy & very pretty on!"
4.0,A little big but a nice dress
4.0,"Honestly this is a beautiful shirt and i could not wait to open it when it arrived.  I tried it on and it was skin tight  - looked at the label inside and there it is ""Athletic Fit"".<br />Unfortunately - the product description on Amazon does not indicate that at all - so here is another return going back to Amazon :-(  Very disappointed."
4.0,"Would have given these 5 stars, but it ran big! Still very cute and I am keeping them!!!!"
4.0,"Not as supportive as my other Bzees, arch is low in comparison. They look nice, and are relatively easy to get on/off."
4.0,"Cute,comfortable, thin material.  You can Almost see through it. But its overall good dress"
4.0,"These boots are cute and comfortable. The color was a bit off from what I was expecting, and the first time I wore them they left that a black line on my floors, but other than that no problems!"
4.0,"Flexible, durable, and visually effective"
4.0,so far so good.  Replaced a similar watch band with this.  The band fully comes apart when unlatched.  Other watches I own with similar clasps stay together so the ends don't need reconnected each wearing.
4.0,Great base layer shirt!
4.0,"The pants look just like the pictures. They seem very plushy and cozy, but they were way, way too small. I ordered an xl for my husband and we wound up giving them to my 14 year old neice. They barely fit her and she wears a size 7 in jeans. Looking back through the product description, they do list recommended weights for the sizes, I just hadn't seen it at first. They were also pretty late getting here, but it's a very busy time of year for shipping. They seem great, I'm just disappointed about the sizing."
4.0,The chain is a bit short but that is okay because everything else about it is perfect
4.0,"NIce to put on in the morning. After about a year of wear, a few of the silicone dots have fallen off. But they still are wearing well and the cotton is soft."
4.0,Great buy for the money.
4.0,item looks wonderful
4.0,My ankles may be too small.  No matter how I linked it it was too loose or hanging too low.  The quality was good but I want some smaller and maybe real gold
4.0,"Definitely stretchy.  The button hole on one is a bit big, though and so when it pulls across the chest, it makes the button pull out some.  I got this in a size Medium. There are a few areas where the thread is loose or fraying and needs to be cut off or resewn a little, but overall, the dress was a good value for the price I paid on sale, and is super cute.  I got a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"I bought these for myself- they are made out of a cheaper plastic, but they did offer quite a bit of darkness!"
4.0,"Updated review: The seller contacted me and offered to send me a replacement for free. It arrived within a week and the problem was fixed. It was a slightly different style, but the front panel is designed with an extra layer that keeps the bra pads in place. Thank you Queenie Ke for your wonderful customer service! Very happy customer! P.S. These seem to be Asian sizes, so order up one size. I'm usually a small or medium in sports bras (36B), 5'4&#34;, 128lbs. I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly.<br />Original review: Cute and fits well but the bra pads slide all over the place. The front panel needs to be sewn to hold the pads in place a bit better."
4.0,Size is not 3 inches. The item is nice but a but pricey for one. I stitched it on my son’s jacket.
4.0,Beautiful dress! Classy
4.0,For me the straps do not stay in place.
4.0,So far so good! Love how my phone fits and how it has a wristlet strap and I can clip my keys to it. Very nice to have all my things while out and about next to each other and not floating around in a big diaper bag
4.0,"Although the material is obviously cheap, it's still looks cute. Very flattering on curvy gals."
4.0,"Good product not overly thick but definitely keeps you warm, probably best used in cooler temps"
4.0,I ordered a size up because that's what other reviewers were saying but it was still a little snug around my butt. Other than that the length material and quality of the skirt is amazing. If you have a larger butt maybe go up two sizes.
4.0,"The product is simple and slick the way I like it,"
4.0,"For the price and the fact these were coming from Asia, I got 2 each of 3 different sizes. All 6 came in orange. My daughter lives it and the Small fit her the best. She's very short so this may not work on someone with a tall torso. However I did see someone cut out the middle straps and it looked great. Beware, there's no padding in these at all. But I don't think it would be hard to add some."
4.0,Not the most comfortable ear cuff but I still really like this cuff.it looks well made and has such detail to it.its also so unique.very pretty
4.0,They came and my husband was so happy with them that he was smiling from ear to ear. Made well and a great conversation piece!
4.0,Little thin. Nice compression!
4.0,My only complaint it gets little sweater fuzzies quickly.<br /><br />Very cute and comfortable. Fits so flattering.
4.0,It was nice and cute for the price
4.0,Very cute. Once washed &amp; dried they do shrink up a bit. So he will probably only wear once. I bought the 3/6 months my Son is 3 months &amp; weighs 14lbs 5oz 24inches long. Should of gotten 6/9 months for more wear.
4.0,Wanted something soft and easy to wear for church. This fit the bill. Hadn't bought many clothes from here but this did good.
4.0,"These are cute, I love the style, but the quality is lacking for a $20 pair of earrings. They seem more like a $7 pair from Claire's.  Both of the stems were bent when they arrived.  They work, but seem like they might snap off soon.  I like the 3 holes on the jacket part so you can hang them at the right height for your ears.  Not bad, but not great either.  They were packaged nicely and arrived fast."
4.0,"The bag looks great, is soft, and well made. For the price point it's an incredible value and won't disappoint. The button clasps wore out after a bit over a year. I'm still happy it as it served me well during that time and it was a good price to begin with."
4.0,Pretty slick. Kinda long legs but fits well.
4.0,"It is a beautiful wallet though, very well made.  I returned it."
4.0,"All in all, it’s a decent belt. The leather is kinda soft which is comfortable and it’s strong. The buttons that secure the actual buckle could be stronger and would be an easy fix with better quality snap buttons. Do recommend."
4.0,"I bought this for my Dare Devil halloween costume and it was perfect! It fits somewhat small, but stretches as you wear it. I made one improvement by duck taping sunglass lenses on the inside of the eye holes. This really brought the helmet together for the costume."
4.0,"I have bought several of these dresses and I love them all.  However, this one describes the color as pink but it's actually a pastel orange/peach color.  I also noticed it was thinner than the others."
4.0,Good basic watch for kids. We had some difficulty setting the time even with following the instructions. My kids really like these watches.
4.0,"Very cute socks. Definitely NOT made for girls with athletic calves! Otherwise, nicely made and worth the money."
4.0,Very comfortable shirt and fits great!
4.0,"Cute little bag, I was surprised although small held a lot.  My phone, wallet, house and car keys, even a couple bars of breakfast cereal. It smells like leather. The only reason I took a star off, it's because the straps took a little while to straigten out. Not too sure if the straps are leather though time will tell...Great little bag for the money."
4.0,"These are great Capris to wear with a long blouse, very soft and so comfortable.  They do not roll down when bending etc.  The only reason for a 4 is that I do not like the seam down the middle, I would never wear these with a short top.<br />I am ordering a few more pair after I wash these and make sure they hold up.  I will update after I wash them."
4.0,"I am 4""9, 115 lbs and 34DD.  This dress fits my chest and my waist! I ordered a size medium.  The material is pretty thick which I love."
4.0,"The bottom still makes you slip at times, so don't run with them on. They're the same size as the child's show size. They are true to size"
4.0,It was what I expected but runs small. Thx
4.0,"Very elegant and well made, perfect for my daughter's first ballet class. Size 110 pictured."
4.0,Very pretty and patriotic
4.0,"Clever design, comfortable fit.  The flesh colored portion of the sock bunches up in tiny folds, making it appear that the top of one's foot is wrinkled.  Great for shoes/ankle boots that cover the top of one's foot."
4.0,"Hat looks good, but was hoping for velcro adjustment in the back rather than the plastic..."
4.0,ordered up 1 size and a little snug
4.0,"I bought this and a few other compression garments for use after a lipo procedure. I don't have an issue with the bottom of this rolling up, and it is much more comfortable (while still providing firm compression) than some of the full-body shapers. It's also much easier to go to the bathroom wearing this vs. a full-body shaper! I just ordered two more since I think I'll be wearing these instead of the other shapers."
4.0,Thin material but fit nicely. Lots of compliments. Good price.
4.0,I love it but had return it
4.0,"I bought these for my brothers wedding.  I used to wear something similar when I was in the Army.  These are much heavier duty than the ones I had back then.  The &#34;hardware&#34; on them almost seems too big.  Either way, you can't see it once you're dressed.  After a night of drinking and dancing only one of the clips came undone.  I couldn't expect for any better results."
4.0,I like the bracelet because I like charm bracelets. It reminds when my Gram and Mother wore them. I wear 8 together and receive many compliments.<br /><br />I also feel good and comforted with the different spiritual themes.
4.0,A little small but nice sunglasses otherwise. Too bad they don’t come with Sperry sunglasses case. You get what you pay for.
4.0,Love this shirt but the white lettering turned pink in the wash
4.0,"My 12 yo daughter wanted a bathing suit that didn't show a lot of skin, but was comfy. She loved it, but said it got itchy when she sweat. She's super picky about clothes, she likes clothes that are too loose and baggy instead of fit, so I got her large instead of medium, it still fit perfect but the tank top part was looser. I'm glad I made this purchase."
4.0,they are nice.
4.0,I love the sweater!!  It is so soft and feels great on! But I wish it was a little longer! I’m only 5’5” but it is almost too short for me to wear!
4.0,"Bought this brand and style for years but the material the panties are made of is very thin, see thru. I don’t care for that. Otherwise they fit very well."
4.0,To rite for fat feet l
4.0,Almost perfect except the face guard is very small
4.0,I love the color of these shoes. I got them for my baby nephew I’m hoping they fit!
4.0,I love the shirt but would have ordered a larger size for a better fit.  I like my tops a little looser and I usually get that when I order a Large
4.0,"So cute! Just size up because it is cropped, overall very happy with it!"
4.0,Thick cloth masks w adjustable ear loop.
4.0,"I really like how soft and comfortable these pajamas are, holding up great so far after a couple washes. The pants are a little longer than expected but they are still great for sleeping.<br /><br />It only comes with one pair, if you want the couple set you need to order two in each size."
4.0,Fun hats for my granddaughters to keep at grandma's house.  We have worn them out to lunch or just played dress up here at home. My girls love them
4.0,"The laces were as advertised. The wax on them makes them untie if you only knot them once though, so just keep that in mind when thinking out what length to purchase."
4.0,I love this. Makes a super cute outfit. My only complaint is that the string ties on the back are pretty long. Definitely learned to make sure I know where they are when using the restroom... not a great day that was.
4.0,Is comfortable and fit as expected
4.0,Super soft. Seam split on 1st wash but worth sewing.
4.0,"I like the style but be aware that these run a bit small. I am a 43-44 waist and these are pretty darn snug. If your junk is on the larger side you'll be showing it off...........but hey whats the harm in that? Not sure I'd wear these to a family swim party, but great on the beach especially if you don;t have a Sppedo body! Took away one start fro the fit"
4.0,"I bought this as a gift. It worked great and is highly reflective. It provides the wearer a warm visible early morning workout safety net. If you have or are a runner and need to be seen by traffic, this is for you."
4.0,"These are big--so much that they hang a little below my earlobe. They are pretty and while each color looks distinct in the picture, in person the colors blend better and the differences are more subtle."
4.0,Just as nice as the photos. It is very cute and fits my petite neck well. My boyfriend loves it when I wear this.
4.0,The only time I don't use it is when it's in the launfry
4.0,"Pretty dress for the money.  Has that vintage retro look I was looking for.  Material is a little thin, but is not see-through at all.  Just may need a sweater in the colder months."
4.0,This being a 54 inch bust made me hesitant to buy this. Never got anything bigger than 46 inch bust. So I took a chance & glad I did. This piece is solidly made & just cool. What I didn't notice in the picture is that the bottom 10 or so inches is made of the thick mesh. Above is the suede material that goes through the body & arms. I love the pocket in the front & how you can pull- up the zipper at the neck & make it a fully solid turtle neck (of  mesh). Love inferred punk aspect. **Don't get put-off by the hood. Since it's made of the thick mesh it doesn't sit flatly in the back. But it really looks great even in profile. Don't be afraid to buy this - spoil yourself.
4.0,These shoes were a very good price and great for a first time peewee wrestler. Although sometimes it is hard to lace and unlace them. Other than that they are great.
4.0,"I really like this lanyard, but it shows how dirty it gets and it is fraying a bit after about 4 months."
4.0,These are adorable and look so cute on!
4.0,"I love this gown so much I ordered it in 3 colors<br /> Only thing is the tag on the back scratches so horribly! Cut it out, and the thread that it was sewn in with still scratches. I even cut a hole in one by accident they are so scratchy. If that kind of stuff doesnt bother you, definitely order them. If it does bother you, the definitely don't."
4.0,"Wanted a dress to wear during the day, instead of always wearing shorts or jeans. Very comfortable and runs true to size. It gets really hot here (110+), would have been nice a little lighter. But I love it."
4.0,"The nightgown is soft and warm, but the neckline was just not comfortable for me.  I wound up cutting a v in it.  True to size otherwise."
4.0,"This shirt is well made and I do love the material. It is a little larger than expected, but it’s not something I mind very much. I would buy again."
4.0,This necklace is a nice quality.  It is much bigger in size and weight than I thought it would be.  It's more masculine looking than feminine but my daughter still thought it was cool for her Zelda Birthday.
4.0,"I loved the color and the overall look. It wouldn't stay closed, i needed a pin to be comfortable."
4.0,"Large watch has a nice case and dial design. The watch is easy to read with a black dial. Interesting seconds hand is made as a smaller subdial in gold with its own time bars, which gives you a different way to read the time. I have seen reviews that list watch movements getting slow or non-functioning within days of purchase, this is because the BATTERY is old and needs to be replaced in my experience, not because the watches movement isn't working.<br /><br />The wristband is two piece vinyl construction that is comfortable on your wrist. However, I did not like the white stitching which looked very tacky. I had some problems with the watch band buckle adjustment, the end of the strap broke and the buckle came loose. The wristband is constructed with thin strips of vinyl over foam rubber. I had to replace the wristband with another band that was made with solid leather construction and would hold up with prolonged use."
4.0,The perfect size. Easy to combine
4.0,"Great value and quality, but too large."
4.0,Size chart provided by seller totally wrong. Way too large. Otherwise I liked it.
4.0,"Hi there! It’s a gift for a member of my family but I opened it to test it out and see The quality etc. Good looking hoodie, for fall not to cool temperatures.  I like the color and the finished. He’ll be happy with it.<br />If the seller offers us wholesale prices we will buy a few for our business to try it custom printing 🤔<br /><br />We might comeback here and well let you know what my nephew thinks about his gift. 🥳"
4.0,these earrings are beautiful! Only complaint that I have is the backing is very cheap and im constaly worried that they will fall off. Just used my own backings from another pair to remedy this issue
4.0,"For an adjustable size ring this is made pretty well.  Size and shape are decent, does take a bit of getting use to when typing.  The engraving is very pretty script and the detailing on the ring is attractive.  The ring sizer opening is on the bottom of the band, all edges, at least on my ring, are smooth and don’t scratch or pinch into the skin.  No price point is listed for this ring at this time."
4.0,"These were better than I thought. Some of my earrings backs were crushed during shipment, but they were easy to bend back in place."
4.0,They were somewhat small but they stretched a bit and fit a lot better for me.
4.0,Pretty earrings. Small. I use them for the 2nd piercing on each lobe.
4.0,"Super adorable, not the best quality but it definitely wasnt as cheap looking as another dress i bought on Amazon. The length was perfect as well not too long and not too short. The style and cut is perfect."
4.0,I liked these for the most part. I did return them though. I think they were too bright for my skin. The red was more bright than I was expecting. They were a bit see thru in the behind- but I think if I went a size up they wouldn’t be. Very soft.
4.0,"These garlands were very cute and cute and come in array of  colors which I expected , now I will tell you we used them as headbands we a little country and I love the way they look on the head and I will say my thigh was too big but they they did fit on my girls , my youngest daughter even wore one as a bracelet, so to say they are versatile is a definite and then again it was a pack of 9 so we were able to get more than one and switch up if we wanted a different color, the only objection to them I have is that the flowers are made of tissue paper , meaning you must be very careful when worn, definitely not meant to get wet , but other that they are fine and very nice for a grown woman to a little girl, the band fits pretty much any size because they are flexable and stretch, not too much but just enough so very durable, very satisfied with these , I will let you know that i received this product for a discounted rate for my honest opinion."
4.0,They are small but nice
4.0,"The skirt was nice and fit as expected, but the top is definitely not for full chested women. While it fit I was falling out of it. Had to return. Too bad because the skirt was almost nice enough to keep the set just for the bottom."
4.0,Pants are kinda thin but comfortable
4.0,great price and i like esp for my smaller face. there is some sharpish edge around the lens but it's fine. i like the blue/yellow ones best and  i wish they would let you chose what you want. I dont mind buying 3 but I'm not a rainbow or zebra stripe person.
4.0,Perfect case for large sunglasses.  Love the clip on feature to hang case on side of purse.  Highly recommend
4.0,"Bought this in an Xl for my 6ft 210 lb boyfriend, as a replacement jersey for his old one. The body of the jersey fits fine. The sleeves are super long, like super long. The material is much thinner than the other Griswold jersey he has. Stitching is good and looks authentic. I'm going to try to hem the sleeves. Wish me luck."
4.0,Very pretty and a great buy
4.0,I love the dress but it doesn't run true to size.
4.0,Not as white as I had hoped but it was good.
4.0,"Very comfortable and seem to be pretty resilient. Will know after a few uses. Only dropped one star because there doesn't seem to be any design factors that make these ""mens"" pantyhose. Not really any extra room in the crotch area to accommodate a man's additional volume."
4.0,Have not worn it yet but excited 2
4.0,They're very easy to open and close and click into place so I don't worry about them falling off of my ear. My only complaint is that they're bigger than described on the listing.
4.0,But one size smaller as medium is still a little loose for me
4.0,"I was a little torn on what size to get in this dress after reading some other reviews. I'm 5'3"", 140 lbs, 32DDD, and opted for a Medium. Overall, it was probably a little big, and a small most likely would have been better for me. It was loose fitting, which is fine, but I usually wear form-fitting clothing, so a tighter fit would not have bothered me. It did run to just above floor length, which I completely expected with my height. What I didn't expect, is that the right side wouldn't keep my chest properly covered all night! I was constantly adjusting myself and pulling the dress over my bra and trying to secretly tuck it in to the strap, but nothing seemed to hold it. So with my body type, I had some major cleavage. Some double sided tape may have helped, but I hadn't spent the time pre-wearing the dress the find out. It looked great though, and now I'm struggling with whether or not to send it back just because of that one flaw..."
4.0,Nice cap but as other reviews have stated- there's no slouch as shown in the picture unless you have a really tiny head. Quality is nice though. Star deducted because pic seems to be a little misleading.
4.0,"I love this skirt—right up until it falls down. I bought the chart-appropriate size and ended up having to put a binder clip on the waist so it would stay up. I tried 2 sizes smaller. Seems great...then, it too falls down. The price makes it worth it, even if I have to put elastic in the waist myself. It covers my knees, lays well and doesn’t restrict movement. It hasn’t pilled, which is a huge concern with these type of skirts.<br />To be clear, the waist stretches  out as you wear it. It seems fine initially. I wouldn’t wear it outside until you secure the waistband, or confirm that won’t happen to you."
4.0,"Nice, soft, purse. I don't know for sure this item is actually animal leather. The grey color is more like a green, khaki and grey mixture. Smooth zipping, quality metal zippers."
4.0,So happy this bathing suit fit so well - it takes me a long time to try on at the stores to find just the right one
4.0,A little hard to get on but I have it as a daith piercing so the whole area is hard to get to.  Very cute with the flower on the bottom. Just gives a peek of sparkle.
4.0,It is for a young girl's Christmas gift.
4.0,"Overall these face mask security lanyards work well. However, I didn't anticipate not liking all the colors as much as I have. It would have been a better product for me if given the option of all black. You're never going to get an orange to compliment any orange face mask or sunglasses you have anyway."
4.0,Order your normal size regardless of what the description says. I ordered one size up as recommended and they’re way too big
4.0,"My husband got this for me, it's cute! It's nice and soft fabric, so it's not irritating to the skin. I'm 5'10 and the dress hits me mid-thigh so I never wear it without wearing leggings underneath, but shorter girls would probably feel comfortable without leggings because it would hit them closer to their knee. Tall girls, if you're not a leggings type, maybe skip this one if you hate shorter skirts?"
4.0,"I like the blue print. I’m 5’2”, 147 lbs with a 36C bra size. I got the medium based on the size chart. The dress fits nice and not tight, but the ruffle around the bust is not flowing- but laying flat on my chest (as if there are no ruffles.) I’m afraid the large will be too big and fall off my shoulders so I kept it."
4.0,"I like the shirt it is cute , but the material is thin and see through and it wasn’t too big or too small"
4.0,"Love this dress! I usually wear a MED, but based on the reviews I got an XL and it fits perfectly. I will probably buy again. I'm 5' 8&#34; and weigh 155."
4.0,"These are just what I wanted. Lightweight, breathable, and true to color."
4.0,Fits as supposed but the rubber band it’s not hard as the original one...
4.0,"Nice & comfortable, but too big for my head. Therefore, useless."
4.0,The belt is nice but the buckle feels cheap.
4.0,"I love the color and the cut is nice, but there are some loose threads on the seams, so the quality isn't stellar. Overall, good for a cheap cardigan."
4.0,"I really liked the look and weight of this bracelet, however the pug charm keeps coming loose.  We don't have the tools to properly close it.  Other than that it is wonderful."
4.0,Great time in to cover up but I prefer the sides to be taxed to gather more than just underneath the arm. I took a needle and thread and put some extra tattoo places in the material and now it hangs like I want it to.
4.0,"I thought the teal would be brighter like the advertisement but it's a very deep teal.  I put my son's royal blue hoodie next to it and my navy dress to see if it was more of a navy.  I thought they sent me the navy instead of teal,but my own comparison revealed that it's just a dark teal.  I'm disappointed but everything about comfort was correct.  It didn't shrink when I dried it on medium heat.<br /><br />My only warning is to be careful of color selection."
4.0,"Better quality material than I expected.  I usually don't put silk-screened t-shirts in the dryer, but this one has dried beautifully without shrinking or ruining the design.<br /><br />Husband loves it - and the Shotokan tiger matches the tattoo on his arm exactly."
4.0,It seems to be of good quality but it is too early to tell how it will hold up during normal use.
4.0,This ring is perfect to wear to cocktail party
4.0,I bought it for my daughter who loves horses.  Great fabric and seems quality. It is her Christmas present so we will see but liked it when I got it out.  Surprised of the quality.
4.0,"I really like this tunic. The brown is a reddish brown, as other reviewers have noted. I disagree with going up a size for this top.  I ordered my regular size (small) and it fits well; I could probably go smaller if I wanted a snugger fit but it surely would be baggy if I went up to a medium.  I am a busty 5'4&#34; and 120 pounds. There is some stretch. It is shaped, but not as quite as narrow at the waist as pictured, which I would have liked."
4.0,"After reading that someone else bought a medium at 149lbs and it was loose, I felt safe following the chart and ordering a medium for my 5’1, 142lb frame. I’m 36C-30-36 with muscular arms/thighs. While it fit my waist and hips fine, it’s a little snug across my thighs and chest and tight on my arm.  It’s not too snug to wear but I do wish I’d gotten a large instead and just taken in the waist a little.  Luckily the dress stretches a little and moves well."
4.0,They're so cute. I assumed it would come with two for both ears. But it came with one. Overall it's still really cute. I just wish it was a pair.
4.0,"The necklace says its 20 inches, but it isn't. I will have to give it to someone like a teenager or child."
4.0,If all leggings can have this fabric it would be great. Non see through and breathable.
4.0,"I bought a few sets of black gloves sizes S,M and L. They are all very well made and look as though they will last if taken good care of. The price is unbeatable and the shipping is fast. A great buy for costume type gloves."
4.0,"Very good looking jacket. I am usually extra small and 5.2 tall, ordered a small, I was afraid it would be too long but it’s perfect just like the picture shows."
4.0,Lighter than expected.
4.0,The dress is comfy and fits well. Only 4 stars becasue the waist is in kinda a weird place. It isn't low enough for my natural waste and not high enough to be an empire waist.
4.0,I sure got my monies worth. Fits perfect.
4.0,A little to fitted
4.0,I like the watch over all. Good looking and all hands function. I did however have to return the first due to the stem pulling out on the first day. They did replace it very quickly and the return process was relatively painless.
4.0,"Perfect wig for Storm! The bangs are a little long and straight and they didn't curve like they do in the picture, so I had to bobby pin them. The wig fits very nicely and even has a strap that holds it to your head better. Worth it!"
4.0,"My new summer ""uniform""!"
4.0,Not horrible
4.0,"This is a very beautiful top. My weight  is 121  pounds and my height is 5’ 3” and the Small runs BIG on me. Originally I decided to return it. But..., on a second thought I decided to keep the top and sew a pair of seams in order to fix it."
4.0,quality is good but it's for size 4 in US sizes if not smaller.
4.0,"At the top of the instruction sheet for this watch it says “1980” amid a bunch of Chinese-language characters, and maybe that is the key to understanding this watch. Because it really IS like a typical digital watch from 1980 or thereabouts: it tells time, has a stopwatch and alarm function, will tell you the date... and that’s pretty much it.  And of course there are a complicated combination of button presses you need to do to set everything and move among the various functions, just like you had to do with your old digital watches way back when.<br /><br />I mean, it’s fine... if you don’t feel like spending only a little extra money for a watch that will count your steps, measure your heart rate, sync with your phone to tell you when a text arrives, etc. The nostalgia and simplicity on display here is actually kind of charming, I’ll admit, so I’ll probably use this watch a little, most likely when my more modern watch is charging. Oh, that’s another thing... this watch has no charger. When its battery eventually runs down you can either just toss the watch or take it to a jewelry store to get a new battery installed... just like you had to do in 1980!"
4.0,Overall the bag is good.  The size is perfect for me to carry my wallet and smartphone.  One side of the velcro strap came off after a month<br />of usage.  This velcro strap is not securely attached to the bag and this is the reason i gave it a 4 star instead of 5
4.0,"These fit very well for my women's hands (generally I'm a small to medium). The red color is a bit of a neon red but not in a bad way. The padding is actually quite thick - much thicker than I'm used to in cycling gloves - but not a problem as I typically have wrist and hand pain. The little loop to help you pull them off is not necessary. The wrist adjustment strap is perfect. I was very pleased in the end with these gloves, as I don't often buy personal training items online! I would recommend these."
4.0,Too small for a 1/2 size up if buying
4.0,"I ordered the tan, but it was sparkly beige so I returned. I love the quality and the style. Would purchase again if it came in another non sparkly color."
4.0,These are slightly to big for my 3.5 year old
4.0,"I loved the pearl flower with the cz's dispersed amongst them. They look classy and eloquent. Great for wedding, parties or just everyday. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the post are bent down and I'm concerned on straightening them, I hope I luck out and all is ok. I know the price is really low, but it's hard earned money  wasted and disappointing, if they don't hold up straight from the package. Have better pride in your product and pack earrings so that the post aren't bent and kept straight."
4.0,Good stuff good work good for everything
4.0,Love the design  Fits well. The compression is ok. I've had the same compression amount that felt a bit stronger in the past but it still helps
4.0,"I absolutely love them. Great for the price and I wear them almost daily. Light weight and you can tell them are inexpensive. But if you are just looking for something to add to your earring collection, this is perfect!"
4.0,"Has some scratches on it, but Ill see if i can buff those out. It shipped fast and im pretty happy with it over all."
4.0,"I bought this to use as a halloween costume as a dark mage.  It was great.  Flattering and got a lot of compliments.  Wore it with black tights and boots.  The only thing, as another reviewer stated, it shows all bumps and rolls, so since this was tighter on me, I wore with high waisted tights."
4.0,Great style and fit. You won't believe it for the price. The only down side is the color rubs off.
4.0,Great for Halloween but way too big for my face. Had to return it
4.0,"the headband is very stretchy and perfect for working out, i love it. the bands on the mask are not comfortable behind ears but its fine since the mask has buttons. i dont actually see a pocket on the inside of the mask to put the filter in though so thats confusing."
4.0,"A little thin, but I’d definitely buy again!!"
4.0,"Super cute bag, my daughter was disappointed that none of her notepads or books fit in it.  Quality seems to be holding up nice she is using it daily for school."
4.0,She says it works exactly like she wanted!
4.0,Fits very snug and is warmer than expected; I'm pleased with my purchase Love the longer length as well
4.0,"At first the ring is rather tight but after a little while it adjusts nicely to the size of my finger. Doesn’t slip and easy to take off, my preferred ring to wear."
4.0,I loved this waist trainer but the only thing  was that it runs big I ordered a medium and I think a small would of fit much better but love
4.0,Love these! Got them for my kids and myself. Fit my kids perfectly. Not so much myself. A little tight but workable. We paired them up with skeleton stockings and were perfect! So many people loved them! We matched perfectly too! Great for everyday use!
4.0,"Quality leather product. Chain it comes with is rather cheap look amd feeling, but overall happy with product. Shipping time is average. Shipping cost expensive."
4.0,"So far it's a good glove,warm fits good..."
4.0,Just the right amount of compression.
4.0,Cute but not much “fire” in them but probably can’t expect much for the price.
4.0,"I use it as a first layer on cold days, underneath a sweater or shirt."
4.0,Very nice and roomy
4.0,"I was nervous to order this bag, it had great reviews from people who used it, but so many people said it smelled horrible when it came, that I ALMOST didn't order it.<br /><br />I am glad I did so far! I see what people are talking about. It has a fishy odor, but as someone who has a very distinct sense of smell, it wasn't overwhelming. It seems to be from the dye they used to color the bag. I put a few dryer sheets in the inside and one in each outside pocket. In the hour or so since I unpacked it, the smell is almost gone. In another hour, I think it will be completely.<br /><br />I can't wait to put my things in the bag, it sits nice on my shoulder with the small straps."
4.0,Always hard when something say hand wash since it can easily end up in washing machine
4.0,These are decent glasses for the price. I bought them to have while i waited for a better pair to be made. They got me through the waiting period. Now my daughter uses these to help reduce screen induced migraines at school.
4.0,"I ordered three of the rosary.  Good but on one of the rosary, there's a missing wooded beed (9/instead of 10).  I give it 4 star because of it otherwise, I would give it 5 starts because it's cheap and you don't need to pay big bucks for a rosary."
4.0,Really love the dress. I normally wear medium but I got the large but little bit small. Didnt like the zipper attachment. Didn't like the length so I took it to alter. Overall it was money well spent will recommend
4.0,"Cute, lightweight, on the larger size of oval earings."
4.0,Very nice quality at a really low price. Highly impressed
4.0,It was good and comfortable pjs.
4.0,somewhat rough fabric but otherwise great fit and style.
4.0,Size would have been fine except very long for a small and very long sleeves. Perhaps better fitting in a large size. Didn't work well for me.
4.0,"I received the necklace much earlier than expected, which is great!<br />My only complaint is that the necklace came flawed.<br />A few of the stones from the necklace were loose in the bag it came in and I will have to reattach part of the hanging strands to the base.<br />It is not a total loss, but I would prefer to receive an item ready to wear and not have to make any repairs."
4.0,its a nice well fitting shirt durable and soft at the same time.. try one you will be satisfied with this shirt
4.0,"beautiful hat, just too large for me, so I gifted it to<br />my sister, it looks is it was made for her, she<br />wore it to church Sunday, she added a few<br />accessories."
4.0,"It is nice for the price, although it is difficult to unclasp the lock on the bracelet.  Very light, but pretty."
4.0,"I love this dress, but I had to take one star off because the flowery embroidered part was practically falling off when I received it. It was easy enough to hand sew down a few places, but I would have preferred to not have to do that."
4.0,"Looks exactly like the photo, lots of wiggle room for adjusting small or large.  Really like the design and looks even better on, have received lots of compliments.  Only suggestion I would make is that the beaded section on the middle band could use ""stopper"" on each end to keep the beads where you would like them.  Overall a great bracelet, no regrets, would buy again."
4.0,Perfect fit. my original Oakley lenses were really badly delaminating from being in the heat of my car and they were basically unusable. These new lenses saved me from throwing away a $150+ pair of sunglasses.
4.0,The hoodie is thinner than in the past or I would have given it 5stars but otherwise checks all of the boxes. Long term to be determined
4.0,"Loved the picture and design, just to snug, and not comfortable."
4.0,"It is cheaply made but that’s because it’s inexpensive. It’s cute and comfy. I knocked off a start because I got the brick red color and it’s definitely burnt orange, not the color in the picture. I hate orange so I’ll be returning it. I’m also 5’6 and 135 lbs and medium was too big and baggy (and I even like loose clothing.) So if I reorder I’ll be getting a small. Also the buttons are just for show and not functional."
4.0,"This top is very pretty and can easily be dressed up or down. The fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. If you're a larger cup size, you may need to size up. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The X-Large would have been ideal.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"I’ve been looking for a medium-weight, red sweatpants that would look nice for a petite like me. I’m 4’11”, 94 lbs so I wanted something that won’t cover up the shape of my legs so much (like some sweatpants do) but at the same time a little loose fitting. These pants have the look that I wanted to go for. I only wish the fit was more tight around the belly  (the reason I removed one star) for more tummy control. I guess that’s because I’m just too tiny? But I have other leggings that are XS and they were tighter than these ones. If they have size XXS that would probably work best for me. But I love these pants. No regrets!"
4.0,mATERIAL IS SOFT.
4.0,Some what satisfied.<br />Arrival & quality was as expected.<br />Would've preferred a darker shade
4.0,"I lost my ZTA t-shirts years ago in a hurricane, and I've always wished I could replace them.  I was delighted to find this cool-looking tee on Amazon, but I was hesitant to buy it because of the cost plus shipping.  I'm so glad I did though, and I love my new shirt.  It's very good quality and fits great.  Mainly, I can show my Zeta pride!"
4.0,"The dress is super cute but it definitely is made of a material that snags easily. I wore it once and noticed pilling and snagging. It does fit well and is stretchy, though. Just be careful where you sit. I was sitting in an office chair. 🤨😑"
4.0,"I tried hard to size right but I was still off, it doesn't fit how it's pictured but still cute"
4.0,Great belt and great packaging. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I had to adjust the belt to fit my husband's size. It was not difficult to do. The only difficult part of the process was punching the new hole to put the screw in the belt buckle. It took some working to get the hole in the leather.
4.0,"Dislike, advertised dimensions are for entire packaging not actual decal. Like, still just right size for my hard hat to display team spirit..."
4.0,"I wish it would have fit better, but I still like it.  It is a nice form fitting, if somewhat tight.  Whatever size you are, make sure you get the next size up."
4.0,"I think this is a really pretty bra (in the back) and that's the main reason I bought it.  I wanted to wear a bra with cami-strap type dresses and tops. I figured it would probably offer more support than a strapless for my chest.  For me it is supportive enough to wear and look pretty... NOT to wear bouncing, turning, twisting, or stretching around with any type of physical athletic activity whatsoever. The people who are wearing this running are probably also the ones who do not need to wear a supportive...or strapless... or one at all?... bra. The front coverage could be slightly more generous to avoid over spill issues on larger chested ladies. The straps could offer slightly better function if they were a tad shorter. The bra could be way better if it was adjustable in any way. The band offers most of the support that does exists. I have an athletic/normal curvy (2 children) built body (34DD-34DDD, 165lbs, 5'10""). I ordered the Large and would have preferred that the band be snugger to offer more support, but feared that going to a Medium would risk reducing front coverage and end up giving the 4 boob look from spillage. After all of that....I kept it. It is serving the purpose that I intended to use it for. It looked pretty under my cami-strap maxi dress and cut out back tee. When in doubt...try it. Amazon prime is great for returns."
4.0,"I am 5'8"", 175lbs male muscular build. I usually wear a 30 in jeans or a medium in gym shorts. I ordered a size SMALL according to the size guide. As far as the waist fitting goes, it fits well. These are really tight around the quads though. I like my joggers tight, but this pair is way more snug than what I'm used to. I dont think they'd be good for a leg day because of how tight they are- pretty restrictive.<br /><br />These are not super thin material, but not super thick either. It is a lighter sweat pant-type material on the inside and a mosture whicking- type on the outside.  Very comfortable for sure. The waist has an elastic band in the inside and draw cords. It also has a reflective Reebok emblem and reflective liner around the leg zipper.<br /><br />The only real CON I had was there is a single rear pocket on the right butt cheek. The pocket has a piece of velcro to help it stayed closed; however, I found that the minute I bend over or squat, it rips open. Thought I ripped my pants the first time flexing in them. I wasn't a fan of the velcro being there, so I cut it off. Easy 30 second fix.<br /><br />I think taller skinnier people would have an issue with sizing. I'd give it 5 stars if it was a little more flexible in the knee and quads."
4.0,Like kerchief style. Fogs up glasses
4.0,It's really nice just smaller then I thought.
4.0,"I’m 5’2” , 215pounds and ordered a xl. They fit perfect. They feel buttery soft. Wish they had more colors. The only thing that I didn’t like is that they rolled down when I sit. If they didn’t roll down they would be worth the price."
4.0,I really like this pj. I didn't expect the back to be striped and the material to be so thin. Other than those two things it is great.  Washed it in cold water gentle cycle and hung it to dry. Came out just fine.
4.0,The dress is really comfy.
4.0,I liked everything about this dress except for the neckline. It goes all the way up to the neck and i wish it were just a tad lower.
4.0,as expected arrived on time
4.0,"The lace edges could use some cleaning up. Otherwise, pretty color and got compliments on it the first day I wore it."
4.0,It fit okay and was comfortable.
4.0,Good costume I guess
4.0,"Love the quality and comfort, but the side patch with the power and volume control are flashes lights the whole time indicating it’s on or charged. Several people asked me why it was flashing the first time I wore it in public."
4.0,"I ordered this top for my Mom to wear under a sweater. She is pleased with the soft fabric, but the neckline is much lower than the picture shows."
4.0,"Quality looks good and the bag looks as pictured but just heads up it's a small bag! Could barely fit in my iPhone 7. It fits in, but it's tight so you have to pay attention to putting the phone in and out; it's not a quick grab. You could probably squeeze some money and credit cards and a lipstick but that's about it. Too small, especially for the price of the gold one. I bought it in 3 colors so will only keep the pewter one as it's just that bit too small."
4.0,They are good quality and well made.  I have a large bust so this is important. I would buy again.
4.0,Cute chokers! Great value!
4.0,No doubt these are one of the most adorable socks I have seen for babies They comes in animal prints and looks damn cute. Material is comfy and light so it doesn't irritate baby skin. Specially good if ur kid is in crawling or walking phase they will be protected from scratching and scraping. But I still find them short. I ordered size 1-3 yr form my 1 yr. they fit perfectly on her feet but not till her knees. They come below her knee length. Designs r very cute.. you have tiger.. cow .. panda .. all look lovely!!
4.0,"Really nice fit. Soft and comfortable. Not much extra to scrunch though, unless you have short legs. A good buy."
4.0,It looks cute but it shrunk so you can see the lining and it looks like a top now.  My daughter loves it as a top more so I will ham it.  It does look like the picture.
4.0,"Love this suit! It's very flattering and the pattern hides my post baby pudge. Only issue is that I have a size 34DD chest and it's a little skimpy on top but if I pull it taught and tie it past where it's meant to be it looks and covers just enough. All in all very happy with this suit, especially for the price."
4.0,I liked the design of the costume. It was made well and was long enough. I hate when costumes come and they are so short! It was exactly what I wanted and expected. The only thing that I had to add was a white tank top and slip as it was somewhat see-through.
4.0,"Bought for my grandsons big ""3"" party! He loves it"
4.0,Nice compliment to my navy blue dress o wore at a derby event
4.0,Good quality but heavier than I expected.
4.0,"Item ran smaller than I expected because many reviews mentioned it ran big. Went with a large, should have ordered an 1x."
4.0,Live in S. FL and have to wear a uniform including black socks.  Not like going barefoot but next best thing.  Bought size M for my 8.5 shoes. Toe to heal a little long but probably because of my smaller foot
4.0,"I bought this at a reduced price to review it. It's the right size, not really attractive and very wide. I wasn't too impressed with the way it fit. I did however do exactly what I wanted it for. I just wanted something to work in and exercise in. I didn't give it 5 because it's so wide. The camo pattern is exactly as shown, mostly stripes with 3 colors."
4.0,I like it... nice earings...
4.0,If you are a tall gal this is not your bag.. it's very sweet and wish the strap was longer.. gave it to my 10yr old.
4.0,"These jeans are great for women that ride with their jeans tucked into their boots.<br />I purchased a 32x34, they fit perfectly from my hips down and are a tad big in the waist. “We are not designed like men’. With that being said, they are very comfortable and I will definitely use these in the cooler months here in Texas."
4.0,I like comfort and fit
4.0,It’s really nice my wife & baby girl likes it
4.0,I normally wear a Medium and ordered an XL. Still kind of snug but love it!
4.0,It's a great dress just runs a little small
4.0,"This was a bit big on me since I'm short and somewhat petite, but I loved the overall look and design of the dress!"
4.0,Good quality but not long enough for my neck.
4.0,Great rings but I didn’t realize how big they were when I ordered them.
4.0,"Loved all the pieces. Obvious downside is it does turn your finger green after a while, but you can always offset that by painting clear nail polish on the inside to prevent that from occurring. I’d highly recommend it!"
4.0,"I got this pretty full zip hoodie for my daughter. She wasn’t initially too thrilled with the color, but I think the comfort won her over because she wears it often. The dark purple is more of a pink. The fit is slim, but the sizing is true. If you want a looser fit it is probably best to size up. The construction of the jacket is good, the seams are nice and the zipper works smoothly. The gathering at the back and lace inside the hood makes this jacket more athleisure than athletic wear but you could wear it for a lighter work out. Lastly it washes well and has no fading or shrinkage."
4.0,Super cute<br />It runs small. Get one suze up
4.0,"This dress is very nice, wears well. Was kinda hard to get on because of the cape, it took a few tries.  For the price this is pretty nice quality. I wear a 18/20 and ordered the xxxl, which fit fine."
4.0,Cozy and warn. I love these.
4.0,"I ordered a xxxl due to me being top heavy and reading the size chart, the dress is a little snug on top and I can only wear a certain bra with it due to the design of the neck. The bottom half of dress is way too big and I'll get it tailored. The dress is good quality for the price, great colors and length. I just wish the top half was a little bit bigger. In the picture I'm pulling the dress in from behind as it's too big."
4.0,Simple elegant anchor
4.0,"This is a nice dress, it’s exactly as pictured. I am a size 10 with a 38D chest. I wear a medium on “standard brands”  sometimes I have to size up because of my chest. I followed the size chart and decided on a size large so it wouldn’t be skin tight.  It’s still very fitted but not obscenely so.  The tie on the front is as pictured, it’s like a giant built in belt that wraps around the front so it ties.  The fabric is very nice, probably my favorite part.  It feels like cotton, I don’t know how they’ve gotten so good at synthetics but it’s impressive if you are a cotton lover like me."
4.0,Aun no lo usado pero aparentemente calienta
4.0,The item was as described but it is just too big on my wrist.  Delivered right on time.
4.0,These seem great and warm. I plan on using them for hunting.
4.0,"This runs a little small. I'm super fortunate because I happened to buy just the right size. Had I gone any smaller I wouldn't have fit in it. IT DOES NOT STRETCH. do not try buying a smaller size and squeezing into it, you won't fit.<br />It's not bad. A little shorter than I anticipated. I am 5'4, 165lb and hourglass shaped.<br />I bought a Large and as mentioned above BARELY fit in it. It was super fitted and I had to get help getting it off. It did give a tiny bit as I moved around.<br />The back actually dips more than the front. I tried it on backwards to see about more cleavage and I actually liked the dress better that way.<br /><br />I ended up having to return it because I was worried I would rip it and I didn't want to risk that at a work party. Next time I will order an XL to be on the safe side but I didn't have time to buy and return it before the party."
4.0,Cute wedge
4.0,Like it! I wished it has halves like 9.5 or 6.5 sizes
4.0,"I think these gloves will be really warm. These are too large for my four year old, so her eight year old sister will use them. I ordered the 0-2 size to replace them. I will point out that I was replacing LL Bean gloves in a size 12-24 months because she has almost outgrown them. I wanted to get something like a size 24-36 months because my kids are on the small size. We spend a lot of time outside and keeping everyone in the right size is important."
4.0,"It was to big for my daughter, when usually she wears bigger sizes, that is why I ordered 18 months size. I wish I would have ordered the 9 to 12 months.<br />everything else is beautiful. I washed it by hand and air dry as some reviews said that some things come off."
4.0,"good, but not as expected"
4.0,These stones are very nice. I have always liked good stones and will enjoy these for a long time. Thank you
4.0,"The quality is good and design is also good, but the tool is not good. It is easy to break. I used it a few time, but it was broken."
4.0,These earrings are so so cute! I keep getting asked if they're kenda Scott. They're also pretty lightweight which is good. The only thing is that the color is pretty much solid turquoise and doesn't have any dark lines running through it.
4.0,It is cute and the colors are nice. Light weight so a great summer evening sweatshirt. Definitely not for colder weather unless you layer it. Good value for the money.
4.0,"Nice tie bar. Simple, professional looking, holds tie in place well."
4.0,Good price and good quality. Only issue I had was a few of them had the pattern upside down. Other than that they were worth it.
4.0,Cool collection. Good variety. Some for to keep and the rest we will use to trade at Disney. Mail very fast!
4.0,This is a pretty nice top. Fits well and is flattering. I also wear it backwards for a different look (weird I know but it works!) The material isn't the highest quality but its fine for the price.
4.0,"The way the product was shipped with very poor!!<br />Placed in a bag... I am very shocked them were in 1 piece when I received them!!<br />Very cute look, but have had alot of people giggle at the name..."
4.0,Great comfort and support.  Not as thick as I would like but I love it.
4.0,Excellent hat for coverage from the sun and heat.
4.0,"The band installed easily.  Overall I like it and wear it all da. The one downside is that the buckle tends to scrape on table surfaces when I'm using it while touch typing.  So if you spend a lot of time typing and rest your wrists on your desk, this might not be the right band for you."
4.0,Run on the small side but are comfortable when properly sized. Smooth lines under clothing. Soft. Well made. Wash and wear well but keep in mind the sizing and expect a close fit.
4.0,I love this dress. Great fit and flattering style and pattern.
4.0,Not as loose fitting as the photo and it’s pretty thing but still a cute top that I’ve enjoyed wearing. I wore a black camisole under it.
4.0,kinda uncomfy but very cute :)
4.0,MY WIFE LIKE IT
4.0,"I have tried something else from this line and I enjoyed that too. Its well stitched, the style is great and did I mention it has pockets?! That's an automatic yes from me!<br />I should mention that since the material is polyester and spandex its probably not best suited for the summer. You will get hot in it, and also it gives a weird..plastic look to it. It looks great from afar but anyone who is standing closer to you can tell how plastic-y it is. Its more apparent since its white.<br />But if that's not an issue to you I really like the style of it. Pair it with the right accessories and you win!"
4.0,"this was a birthday present to my brother, wants to represent the, he enjoy the hat, will order other one"
4.0,"Surprising clarity considering the price. Good value for the money. Power doesn't seem to be 30x, however. Don't know why."
4.0,This look lovely with my wedding dress
4.0,Love this shirt. Great quality and the color is as pictured. I feel like the shirt may run a little small. I sized up hoping for a looser oversized look and to be able to tie a little knot in the side. I wish I had gone up 2 sizes because although it is not super fitted it is not loose enough for the side knot without making it look really tight.
4.0,Costume is cute but the leggins fit TIGHT. I could still wear them but they were snug for a girl with some curves.
4.0,"There was one little tiny flaw in the plastic. But, for the price, this pair of sunglasses is great. Especially if you are looking for a large pair."
4.0,"The fabric of this tunic is great quality, (I'm a self proclaimed seamstress of 12+ years so I know fabric) it's very soft, comfortable and incredibly stretchy. Good thing too because I bought a XL (I wear a woman's M-L) and  it was very form fitting. Not loose like I was expecting from the picture. It's a nice long tunic length and feels great on. So I'm not too horribly disappointed. 😉 I don't think I'd purchase another, as it didn't fit like the picture and smells very chemicaly even after washing. But I do like it, so worth a one time purchase. 😊"
4.0,Bought these strictly for fashion. Goes great with lots of my wardrobe. Not very dark lenses.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and I was very impressed by the quality of the dress. The dress fit comfortably on top and the bottom was extremely snug. I'm 5'5,  38B cup, and weigh 170. I ordered a large but i recommend going up a size."
4.0,A bit large but a little alterations and a beautiful gown
4.0,I got this for my mom. She loves it. Has plenty of room for all her stuff she carries with her to church.
4.0,It was beautiful for the event and then it tarnished quickly. Still a great buy with 3 different options.
4.0,Bought these for my son who is a physical therapist trainer and he wears them under his shorts since he works with individuals that require floor excercises.  He would normally wear a medium and sometimes large and other raters commented that we should order up a size.  Ordered XL and they fit very nicely.
4.0,Beautiful!!!❤️
4.0,love it work great
4.0,"I read tons of reviews to help me figure out what size to order.  I ordered a 5X based on what others were saying.  I'm 5' 10'' 160 lbs.  The 5X is a little big, not so big I'm going to return it but I bet the 4X would have been perfect.<br />The fabric is a nice quality.  It's leaving black fuzzies all over everything and I've washed it twice.  I'm sure it's just going to take some time to wash them away.  The zippers are kinda crap.  I was locked inside once because the zipper had a major failure and when I muscled it through I thought for sure I broke it but it still works.  I just make sure that I'm gentle with it now.<br />Moral of the story is for $30 it was worth it!  I'm happy with my purchase!"
4.0,As close to the original Buxton Executive two-fold as possible. Not what I had hoped for but will serve the purpose. Nicely made.
4.0,"Quality is good, especially for the price.  I usually take an XS even though a double XS is suitable for my height and frame.  However, fit was a bit larger with this cardigan.  I had planned on layering with a light sweater and blouse for fall/winter office attire.  The sleeves were too loose.  The drape felt robe-like.  Just looked too frumpy on this chick.  Waawaah."
4.0,Purchased to wear during a photoshoot. Looked nice! Haven't worn more than a couple of times though.
4.0,This ring is simple and delicate. There is only one size which fit a little larger than my normal ring size.
4.0,Viene un poco grande
4.0,Love these velvet durags. Absolutely amazing.
4.0,LOVE this top!! Sooo cute with a bralette. I am a 14/16 and got an XL and it fits true to size. I can wear L or XL in shirts. If I wanted a looser/longer fit I would need to get a 2XL.
4.0,good for parties
4.0,"Incorrect size sent. Other than that, shoes seem sturdy and are cute."
4.0,"Lenses are very good.  Folding is a little awkward, but works fine.  Sides work well and the glasses are comfortable.  My only criticism is that I got the red version, and they are not real red, a bit on the orange side of red.  But, I still like them.  My wife also has a pair and likes them very much"
4.0,good quality but was much larger than expected
4.0,"They're nice, the color is a little off but they do fit okay."
4.0,"I was excited to get these earrings, but must say was disappointed in the small size.  They are cute tho."
4.0,This purse is fabulous!!! Much bigger than what the picture shows. I ordered another one for my daughter.<br />Beautiful and very soft. Holds a great deal of stuff-which is good for me!!<br />Would recommend to anyone who likes a bigger bag. I am going to order another one<br />in a different color too.
4.0,Was smaller than expected but sister loved it.
4.0,"Paint scratches easy, but it was only 15$ so can't go wrong."
4.0,"I figured since I had ordered this same skirt in a large and I had to return it, I would order it in a xlarge and<br />it still feels a little snug. They probably run very small, I'm thinking of returning it again, but may keep it, if<br />I put on a girdle."
4.0,"Great shirt and fabric. Runs a little small, but we exchanged for a bigger size and it was perfect."
4.0,The size is true US measurements. Which on Amazon is very important. The fabric and stitching is sound. The design is flattering and will camoflage the &#34; pouch&#34; 😜. The fact that the back is covered works well for women with back fat. The swimsuit will work on variety of body shapes.
4.0,Nice Dress fits well. Hugs the body but doesn't squeeze. I does snag easily.
4.0,I’m decently short so these are a tad long. I just roll the bottom part under and it helps. Other than that they fit a little bigger and different in black than they do in green.
4.0,"No es cuero animal, es un tipo de licra brillante que da la idea de que fuera cuero. Sugiero comprar en una talla más chica para que quede bien ajustado al cuerpo, este artículo corre en talla algo grande."
4.0,Very cute seemed true to size a little big because it's stretchy it can very wrinkled and had a weird smell to it also no cate instructions but a super cute dress
4.0,"Nice looking glasses, but the arm part is a little short for me. Wish they were half inch longer."
4.0,A little snug but served its purpose.
4.0,"Too tight all over.<br />But warm and soft though, stretchy!!"
4.0,"I love this skirt, it’s a beautiful metallic antique gold and shimmers in the light. I’ve worn it and had so many compliments."
4.0,"Not the greatest quality, but not bad!!"
4.0,It is a great looking watch but if you wear reading glasses it is difficult to see the hands with out them in some light. Would be almost 5 star if the strap was i/2 inch longer..........
4.0,I get lots of compliments on this top.  I wear it with leggings.  It is short and rather thin but because of the color it is not transparent.
4.0,"Fit was a little small, but not bad. Would order next size up if you like your tops looser."
4.0,"They're as I expected, same material as previous brands that I find hard to get nowadays. Fit is what I wanted, a compression/fitted type shirt that I can wear underneath another shirt to keep me cool, or to run in while it's 90+ degrees outside. The neck was poorly sewn though, the seller was quick to help me out. I would buy more if needed."
4.0,Fits frame fine lenses color a little light but could live with it
4.0,"I do like this beanie, fits me securely and is sufficiently warm for running in temps in the low 20's. I was expecting it to be just a bit thicker."
4.0,"They are comfortable to wear but maybe they need to offer an XS, I am 5'2"" and they were long by a lot on me. They are soft."
4.0,"I am 5' 5&#34;, 135 lbs, B cup and the medium fit me well. It's a polyester blend I believe and has a slight stretch. It hangs nice. Took about 3 weeks to arrive. Is it the best quality? No but worth it the for the price."
4.0,Otherwise it's a nice and pretty dress.
4.0,"I bought this for my husband for an upcoming beer festival, outdoors in February.  He will be warm and &#34;stylish&#34;."
4.0,"It's a very cute shirt, a little tight around the top, but it still feels comfortable.  Ordered XL I'm 5'2"" and around 180. It has been washed several times and has kept it's color."
4.0,"Overall, surprisingly decent quality, runs at least 1 size small not super stretchy fabric either. So if you can get your size, order up."
4.0,"I received the package on time and shipping was easy to track. The unitard is made sturdy and not see through the cotton is very thick and soft. It also, has some stretch and give to it. However, it may fit a bit sung, but that's how I like mine to fit. I can wear it under my pants on those cold winter days. This is a great buy!<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars, but the seller is not very good with communication or responding back to customers. I contacted the seller because I wanted to size up, but there was never an answer to my question."
4.0,Cute and made of nice material but is fitted around the stomach area. I ordered an XL
4.0,We used this for our daughters Halloween costume. She absolutely loved it. It fit well. My only complaint would be that the shirt fit smaller than the pants. It was almost like the shirt (top) was a different size than the pants. It was a little tight and my daughter wears a 10/12. But it worked for Halloween and she loved the costume. It was really comfy! She even wanted to keep the pants on after Halloween and tried to sleep in it!! So all in all this was a great costume and held up for trick or treating. Would definitely recommend for Halloween or any other dress-up activities!
4.0,Cute print.
4.0,My wife felt the shirt was too tight and not soft enough to sleep in due to logos being a little rough.  She loves the pants which was the main reason I purchased them.  Pants fit perfectly.
4.0,"Very soft and easy to work in , they are pretty good for my kind of job l m never a multi floral person but l do love  them because they are really comfortable"
4.0,"Great value, fits snugly, keeps me warm!<br />Only concern the zipper is reversed, meaning you have to slip the right side into the left, unlike what I've been doing my whole life!"
4.0,I luv it. I’ve got many compliments from people.
4.0,Product was as expected works well wish it lasted longer though
4.0,"4 stars because it's slightly sheer at the bust but a bra in a solid color, i.e, nude, black etc will fix that easily. I wore a bra with a logo and the logo showed through so keep that in mind but I love this top!"
4.0,Provide great support
4.0,"First, full disclosure... I previously bought, returned, and reviewed the Ogio bag--which could not hold my clothes or my size 12 sneakers.  Jennifer from the Glo Bag contacted me and asked if I would try theirs and review it.  I've been using it for about 10 days, a half dozen trips or more to the gym.  Here's what I've found...<br /><br />*My size 12's fit fine.<br /><br />*The ventilation in the shoe compartment seems to keep away that 'gym bag smell.'<br /><br />*I was concerned the bag would not hold my clothes.  I'm over 6' and go 225 lbs.  Not to worry, everything fits with room to spare.<br /><br />*It is extremely handy to have everything at eye level in my locker--I didn't realize I wanted/needed this until I had it.  Because it's easy to hang the bag, I do so, and lock the locker up when in the shower, sauna etc.  Makes stealing my stuff much harder.  I avoided trying to stuff other gym bags into the locker because they just didn't fit in well.<br /><br />*There are any number of mesh and slash pockets to put stuff in.<br /><br />*It's very handy to have the backpack design--I just sling it over one shoulder and take off.<br /><br />*It seems well made, durable ballistic material, good zippers etc.<br /><br />*I find the mesh pocket on one of the backpack straps very handy for my gym card--guess it's supposed to be used for a cell phone.<br /><br />*The upper compartment holds a full length pair of sweat-pants, a workout shirt, underwear, spare socks, and I could stuff a towel in there if my gym didn't supply them.<br /><br />*There are a number of hanging loops so you can likely hang it in whatever configuration your gym uses.<br /><br />*There's a separate cosmetics kit.  I don't have a lot of use for gym cosmetics, so I stuff an extra water bottle and my hairbrush in there.<br /><br />*There's a black mesh pocket hanging in the upper compartment handy for a wallet, and hard to see if you're not really looking to steal stuff.<br /><br />Most excellent products--and this is one--also could use a few tweaks.  Here are things I would like to see...<br /><br />*Attention to equipment other than cosmetics.  I have sort of struggled where to put my ipod, my full-size headphones, my chest strap and wrist monitor etc.  I'd rather see an 'equipment bag' in the middle compartment than a cosmetic case.  Maybe this could be a customer selected option.<br /><br />*There are slash pockets on the front and back of the bag.  There's a small one in front and a large one in back.  I'd like them reversed.  If the large one were in front I could stick my headphones in there and hide my wallet in the back one.<br /><br />*I'd like two places to hold water bottles/travel coffee mugs.  Truth be told I am often carrying both into the gym.<br /><br />In summary, this has become 'my gym bag' and I am finding it flexible, useful, and generally very well thought-out.  Can I give it 4 1/2 stars?"
4.0,"Love this dress, love the color, love the fit! The embellishments are very delicate though, and one fell off quickly."
4.0,Good addition to my Beatle shirt collection.
4.0,"These are the best fitting glasses I have ever had.  I use them as a sunglasses in order to protect my eyes.  So far, I love them.  However, I am surprised they do not come with a hard case.  How come?  All of my glasses have their own hard cases and these glasses don't?  When I go to the eye doctor I always put glasses in a hard case and not in a pouch..."
4.0,"The pants are smaller than the stated size recommended, and the fabric is essentially sheer."
4.0,Very cute but not a lot of room inside. I can barely fit my phone in it and the white gets dirty very easily. I still get compliments on it everyday though even when it’s dirty.
4.0,"This is a nice jacket, the sewn on logos and graphics are very nice and detailed and the jacket fits true to size...it is kind of thin though, not much of any lining in it so it's not going to keep you warm on a cool day, definitely a spring or autumn type of jacket but nice."
4.0,hey took 2 weeks to get here but they were as expected
4.0,Really great. Bought the recommended size for a 2 year-old and it’s definitely big on her but it’s warm and fuzzy and she’ll grow into it.
4.0,"i like it but somehow the right side button is broken so the lamp is hard to turn off, not like the other one."
4.0,The feel of this tank top is good<br />My issue is the cut is very strange for an extra large seems like a double or triple X under the arms but it’s OK at the waist and chest.
4.0,The product quality is good but the yellow coloring was much paler than I had expected . I thought it was gonna be an actual shade of yellow but it looks more like a pale tan. Just a heads up .
4.0,hi mom
4.0,Had to sew the ear loops smaller and I have a pretty big head!
4.0,"Fit is good. Warmth is great. The only thing i can say about this particular sock is that when i wash and dry it, it sheds a lot. But other than that, it’s awesome."
4.0,lighter than most yoga socks. good grip and colors are as depicted.
4.0,"Like the style, good fit, lens cut glare. Would give 5 star but left lens popped out the first time I put them on. It was not in properly when shipped. Replaced and is in firmly now. Nice case and accessories. Reasonable price."
4.0,This works for going under a low cut shirt without having to wear a full cami.  I dislike the seam in the middle of the lace but otherwise great!
4.0,Nice and long. They are not for warmth. They are super comfy.
4.0,"I've had it for about 2 months and so far its holding up well. The color was a little different than expected, but none the less cute everyday bag. Big enough to hold enough. Good buy"
4.0,Really Like the glasses really Bad Ass....Negatives lenses are cheap and doubt if they give any protection from the sun
4.0,"These shoes are great for the price. They aren’t the best shoe for running, but they hold up well for me in the gym. I can’t tell you how many random people compliment me on these shoes!"
4.0,Not the same patterns but i gave it to you worked out great and shipped quickly
4.0,Slightly snug across the chest but otherwise perfect.  Love the pockets!
4.0,this was a gift. she's worn it for over a year now and it still looks great.
4.0,I love the purse but it has a very funny smell.
4.0,I love this bag. I use it everyday! I just wish it was just a tad bit bigger! Other than that I would highly recommend this bag!
4.0,"I got this band for my wife. She has a really small wrist, so I had to remove almost all of the links, which means on her it just looks like the chain link portion of the band. Most watch bands have arrows showing which way to push the pins out, but this one doesn’t, which made the process more difficult. The tool made it easy to remove the pins once I figured out which direction to push them out, however when placing the pins back in I had to hammer them in since they wouldn’t easily push in. The band links have some weight to them, which makes it seem more durable than other links that are only made out of plastic. It is a true yellow gold. Overall, my wife is pleased with how it looks, but she said it’s difficult to undo the clasp when it is on her wrist (she said you not to remove it with some force)."
4.0,"i wish i had ordered a size smaller, but otherwise a cute top!"
4.0,"Cheap material, nothing like pictures.<br /><br />Update- what I said before is still true but the company after my review was willing to give a refund, due to their customer service I have updated my rating. Service 5/5 stars"
4.0,"I love the make of the earrings. Theyre beautiful and shiny. On the other hand, theyre really heavy.i wouldnt wear them for long periods of time."
4.0,"i really like this, but the hoop is thicker than what i expected:,) but that's my mistake i should have done more careful research. I like it but omafter a while of having it i notice that it doesn't click when i close the hoop. so sometimes it falls out easily. Other than that it's okay.:)"
4.0,Nice feel but gets me sweaty
4.0,"My only complaint about this bib is that its a hassle to put on with the long sleeves. Otherwise, it's awesome. It reminds me of the smocks you wear at the hair salon."
4.0,A couple of mine arrived cracked on the face. And I have to shorten the strap on both of my purses in order to be able to hang either one of them without having them touch the floor.
4.0,"Love this company's products - they have great quality, nice designs and great value.  Unfortunately I had to return because it did not fit. Had it fit this would have been a 5+ star item. I'm a curvy XL to 2XL but no belly.  Although my torso is a bit long I normally do not have to order &#34;long torso&#34; however the waist on this item hit me pretty high up on the rib cage.  I was disappointed to have to return because this is a really well made basic wardrobe item that can be dressed up or dressed down.  I will continue to shop this company because of their great value and quality."
4.0,"I love long tank tops, especially ones with a lace hem to wear under my shirts and to show underneath. I ordered a size up on this since I am large chested and it's cotton. Next time, I would order it in my normal size. There isn't much stretch to it so it doesn't really stay down to show at the bottom of your shirt. It's also not as long as I expected. It is comfortable and will probably - for me - make best as a night time tank top/pajamas. Ones I have tried in the past and liked had more stretch, more support and were long enough to cover your bottom (I'm 5/8)."
4.0,VERY very cute! Shorts fit bit smaller than shirt. Adorable
4.0,There are great and perfect for my toddler's thin and curly hair. I took away 1 star because the threads of her favorite colors are starting unravel already.
4.0,Really nice shirt. Ordered a small since it is men’s sizes but it was smaller than I wanted. I am female 5’ 7’ 110lbs. Retuned for a medium. Specifically returned to being a little to “hugging “ around the hips was looking for a looser fit at hem.
4.0,Longer than expected.
4.0,"The fabric is super soft and very comfortable. I’m a 16/18 and the XL fits loosely without being huge. It’s very lightweight but seems to keep me a consistent temperature throughout the night. I’ve wish listed two more.<br /><br />Only thing I don’t like is you can’t put it in the dryer. But if it helps it last longer and stay soft, I’m not too worried about that."
4.0,"Black and White version. The suit is attractive and well made, but the black side panels are mesh and show all imperfections. The top is light and has no control, so if you have contours you don't like, they show completely. For someone who has a good shape without weigh loss loose skin, it is a very nice suit. I'm 5'5&#34;, 130 lbs and the Medium would look nice had I not gained and lost weight in my 40s making rolls of skin that are completely visible through the mesh. I have to return it. (Dan's Wife)"
4.0,"Great looking dress,  fabric is much nicer than I'd expected."
4.0,These are really beautiful and I get lots of compliments wearing them. I deducted a star because I'm a little skeptical that they are sterling silver. My ears are really sensitive to metals (holes get red and infected) and after a few hours of wearing these earrings they went red and felt itchy.
4.0,"Fit perfectly, however, this is due to me sizing up. I bought it for my girlfriend who is 5'10 and roughly 180lbs. She normally wears a large, however, I bought this in an XL and it fits perfectly! The material is a bit thin, and certainly not cotton like a regular t-shirt. I would assume it's more of a polyester blend."
4.0,"Very cute, arrived quickly. Definitely runs small order at least one size bigger.  Only complaint is it is quite a bit shorter than I was expecting.  It is hard to tell the length in the photo since there aren't any with the dress being worn.  It is more of a tunic blouse than a dress but it still looks cute with leggings and boots so I'm happy with it."
4.0,My wife was really happy with the bracelet.
4.0,This little chick is exactly what I wanted. She’s small and unassuming and comfortable to wear.
4.0,Very cute. The belt looks just like the picture.
4.0,"Oh my God!!! This is way more exquisite & gorgeous than in the pic. The cream beads are actually gold beads & the workings on the jewelry are very intricate. Totally perfect for my Hindu wedding. One of the posts on one of the earrings was bent a lot. I was able to bend it back without breaking it (fingers crossed) and one of the links in the 2nd chain was broken so I'll have to get that fixed. Probably how it was squeeshed done under the collar necklace and bubble wrap on top, but so beautiful. I was blown away. Other persons I showed were wowed also."
4.0,"11/3 Review:<br />Had to order 3 different times in different sizes due to receiving a jacket instead of pants once, and sizing being rather inaccurate.<br /><br />Attaching photos of 176cm, 164cm, and 152cm pants on the same 14 yo 130lb boy who wears 29x29 pants.<br /><br />From the looks of it, 176cm pants are a little bit larger than size Small adult pants.  164cm do the trick for my son, despite odd waist sizing."
4.0,"Ordered for my wife. She wanted a heavier, more durable cold weather water resistant jacket since all she had were windbreaker type jackets for rain. She is happy with the size and water resistance, but she said it really isn't as warm as she was hoping. Might be worth running to a brick and mortar to test out a jacket prior to purchase at this price point."
4.0,"Cool, comfortable bootie. I'm a hair stylist and on my feet all day. Wore these for 9 hours and felt pretty great at the end of day."
4.0,Thank you just what I wanted 👍👍
4.0,A little big in the waist
4.0,"purchased for 14 year old daughter.  Color beautiful, size good.  It was a little big on top but I expected this from reviews.  With the sash tied it fits perfectly."
4.0,Super cute for summer but make sure you do your crunches first cuz it’s super short
4.0,Received on time. Item as advertised and fit was as indicated. Price was good.
4.0,Comfy fabric but slightly thin. Reminds me a lot of LuLaRoe fabric which I happen to like (just not the weird patterns). These aren’t for working out but are more suited to wearing under tunics with loafers or whatever. The fabric isn’t workout grade.<br /><br />I ordered the 2x and usually wear an 18 in pants. These are a little big but I was worried the XL would be too tight.
4.0,Quality of materials is good.  The opening is smaller than those I'm purchased previously.  So read the deminsions to make sure they work for you. I can slip my hand threw so will keep them but I would have appreciated another inch.
4.0,Easy enough to adjust and you can always tuck the string into a figure 8 if it dangling bothers you. I just like the minimalist look of these bracelets and it gives you something to fiddle with it.
4.0,I just love it for my little girl
4.0,The item fit smaller than expected other than that it arrived early and quality is good
4.0,"If you're looking for super tight, difficult to put on shirts for extreme slimming, these aren't those. But if you're looking for something that fits tight and well, not hard to deal with, and easy to care for, these are for you. I'm 5'10' 185 in shape and ordered the same size (M) that I buy for shirts and sweaters. Just right."
4.0,"I love this hoodie but the arms and shoulders are really big and the waist is super small.  I ordered an XXXL wanting it to be really big, but it is narrow at the waist.  Zipping it up was a challenge.  It is an amazing jacket and really warm.  I would absolutely buy again!!!!"
4.0,Found great value and quality of finish in product and enjoyed the look of stainless and black in a man's bracelet.
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, but I am a little too wide for this shirt."
4.0,"These shorts fit well and look good. However, what I received required me to break out the scissors and cut off multiple hanging threads. It’s not the end of the world, but I expected better quality control from Reebok."
4.0,"tight but still fit, i need to work out more and eat less .....everthing"
4.0,Saving for a gift.
4.0,"Good value, well made, would make a great gift"
4.0,"Me gusta esta marca porque todo lo que he comprado me queda a mi medida, este articulo no es la excepcion, me encanta porque también es muy suave y cálido. No le di 5 estrellas porque el color difiere un poco con el de la imagen aunque NO es problema para mí."
4.0,i really liked these
4.0,I love this scale. It works really well for food and precious metal weighing. Has auto turn off and every unit I need to measure in and more.
4.0,Ordered a different size.
4.0,I absolutely LOVE THESE  SOCKS!!!
4.0,It's nice to wear it in usual occasional
4.0,Super cute top very stretchy and comfortable stretchy what makes it very nice
4.0,Very cute earrings for little girls. They come witha nice pouch to keep them in. They were much smaller than I thought they would be.
4.0,Don’t wait until the event to try getting this on for the first time!  I’m a 36 waist and it was on the last notch and getting it all connected was a challenge.
4.0,The letters came out with the tape...everything else seemed fine.
4.0,"Love the shirt quality, but to small. I am a size Medium and the Medium is a bit tight. Go up a size for better fit."
4.0,Little tight but still like alot.  Lose nother 10 lbs and will be just right
4.0,I love these things...they really do work...and they are so cute!
4.0,"Liked this even though it was hard to figure my size. I bought it mostly for the bottom anyway.<br />But when I tried to order another, they were no longer available,"
4.0,"I really like this shirt, however, to be honest it's a little large. I could have probably gone for a small but I'm a medium 98% of the time. I'm 5'7, 145lb and the medium fits fine, but I bet the small would have been more flattering on me."
4.0,Tried these on and the fit was good. Would order again.
4.0,Tienes que bajar un tamaño
4.0,"I love this bodysuit, I have received many compliments. I am 5'4, 133 pounds and ordered a medium. The material is what you would expect of the price, does not fasten at the bottom like most body suits so it is more of the fit of a leotard. The string that laces up is a little thicker than expected but it still looks fine. It looks great with a pair of high waisted jeans!"
4.0,"Cute. I know this type of top is meant to be large and flowing, but it is seriously so big that I wind up having to tie it."
4.0,The glasses are a little big but they fit very well over my glasses. I would recommend.
4.0,I got this for a cringy OC star wars cosplay I wore to comic con one year and while I look back at that day and cringe the mask itself worked fine and if you're using it for airsoft it will work well too. It has a bit of a plastic smell inside though so keep that in mind.
4.0,"I am 66 years old; and this looked too young for me, pretty dress. Great dress for the price."
4.0,"Well made vest.  Looks nice.  We had them embroidered with our company logo for the employees to wear at work, and they look casually professional.  Very pleased."
4.0,"It's nice, but zipper is not great though"
4.0,This is an ok mask.
4.0,"Very nice! Pearls are detachable so I can have something from my own collection to put on the hoops too. Hoops are well made, solid. Just a suggestion: Tahiti pearls slightly bigger size will look good too."
4.0,"I just got this today, and it's got a wonderful weight and feel to it. I wasn't able to get the seller my measurements, but the standard large size fits me wonderfully. I am in love with this jacket and can't wait for the cooler weather!"
4.0,I love this bathing suit. I got a 2XL and It fits as I expected it to. The top is a bit tight but it works out because it offers great support.
4.0,"The dress was absolutely gorgeous. I’m 5’10 and 187 pounds . I ordered an M-US because, I have smaller boobs. The chest area was still very loose . The dress is a little scratchy but, hey it’s worth the price ."
4.0,Product is perfect. Vibrant colors but does run small.
4.0,Super cute though.
4.0,Super soft material. It looks like a sweatshirt in the pic but it's more of a thick tshirt material.
4.0,Super comfortable and classy looking.
4.0,It was small and short and I am 5'2 and 120 lbs. I would reorder in a medium and different color if it wasnt for the sleeves at the end. Didnt look good on me.
4.0,"First dress came with 2 holes in it. I returned it and ordered a new one. It looks great but it’s different from the first one. The print is in different spots. Overall I like the dress, it’s a great price, super comfortable and stretchy."
4.0,Good quality for the price Bt I was surprised that the orange is more like a neon bright orange Bt over all worth it
4.0,Not much to dislike other than the thin and kinda-wonky strap. It gets twisted in the adjustment clasp.
4.0,It’s nice. I recommend ordering up one size. The only dislike I have is that the material is a bit thin
4.0,Very nice price and quality
4.0,"The band arrived ahead of schedule. I was happy with that. The band itself seem to be made well, and of good quality. The only issue that I have is, I wish the band was a little longer. That's just me though. My watch fit well on it and I'm satisfied."
4.0,Good glasses but too tight.size is not as discribe...
4.0,It's ok. Probably could find if in the store. Thin and cheap made. But it will work
4.0,"It arrived on time, and the box was in good condition.  The item appeared very small when we took it out of the package, but it fit about how we hoped it would.  We just so happened to order one size up from the size we would have typically bought to ensure it wouldn’t be too small, which might have been helpful.  The material is a bit thinner than many other clothing items sokeep that in mind if you plan to wear it out in the cold weather."
4.0,The zipper is a bit concern for me.
4.0,Good workmanship.<br />Just need to stretch the slots out a bit.
4.0,Definitely go with a larger size.  This dress runs small.
4.0,A little larger than I expect. They are very cute looking. The price is a good deal.
4.0,"Beautiful and elegant dress. However it did not work for me, as I was pressed for time .  It was too long, and I needed to shortened, especially if you want the look as shown in the picture .  I also ordered a size 6.... but a 4 would of been perfect ."
4.0,My  niece has recently taken up dance and I got this leotard for her. It fits as expected. The light blue color is nice and the fabric is quite soft and comfortable. This is a good value basic dance leotard.
4.0,Colors are not quite as vivid or crisp as pictured. Overall a cute band though.
4.0,"The classic aviator look and fit.<br /><br />I've come to really like polarized glasses, and I appreciate the case these come in.<br /><br />They feel well made and are a solid deal for $20."
4.0,Its cute though
4.0,"So I marked this as &#34;fits as expected&#34; because I think I expected too much from it. I was thinking that it was going to be stretchier than it actually was. I ordered an XL even though I'm consistently an XXL (dress/pants size 18-20). It does fit me and I wear it with leggings for a lazy day at home, but it's not as flattering on me as it would be on someone who is a true XL. It is, though, comfortable and easy to wear."
4.0,I like the top but it can be a little longer.
4.0,Colors are vibrant. Fit is great. Pockets are awesome.
4.0,These pearls has a beautiful gray color on them.  I like how it can convert from studs to &#34;front & back&#34; earrings. The only thing that was an issue was that the post from the small pearls inserting into the larger pearls were loose.
4.0,"Got this for my wife for Christmas. She loved it. Fits well, but be warned, it may shrink a little after you wash it. I figured it would and ordered a size larger"
4.0,"Great for the price! Washed it once, and the bra wire is coming out. Great fit"
4.0,I am using these as headrst covers on my new 2008 Chevy Cobalt. they are a pretty good fit and my favorite colour
4.0,All kinda looked the same
4.0,"Imagine my surprise when I opened this stretchy tube type buff rather than the cotton bandana I was expecting.  Luckily, my daughter was delighted."
4.0,"Nice suit for the money. Easy on , easy off.<br />I'll use it , though I could use longer torso.(always my problem)<br />I've been wearing a 12 and that is what I bought."
4.0,"I loved the dress it fit to my body a little tighter then I wanted it too I ordered it two sizes to big,  and it came back just my size."
4.0,"This was a super cute ring.  I bought it for my daughter and she loved it.  It looks like quality jewelry, but for less price."
4.0,Just got the ring today and the quality is amazing given the price. The 10.25 felt small compared to my other rings of the same size from other sellers. I'm planning on returning and replacing with a larger size because it looks great.
4.0,"Love the bag. Perfect size for a professional woman to tote a laptop, portfolio or documents and then some. Same Harvey's quality of construction except they don't put metal feet on this bag. Why Harvey's!? Why!? Nice big internal pockets and both shoulder straps are great lengths. (The removable strap is adjustable.)<br /><br />Only 4 stars because there are no metal feet! :(<br /><br />Also, not a quality issue, but something to note about the &#34;wanderer&#34; color... the upper portion is more cream colored in the picture but in some light it looks more dove gray than cream."
4.0,"Most dress gloves use very thin (read cheap) leather.  These use a solid grade of leather, the lining is comfortable, and the gloves are well made."
4.0,"On cold weather, I would wear this almost indefinitely. The weight while it may feel slightly heavy to others, gives me the sense of security from outdoor elements. Would wear for outdoor jogging."
4.0,"Super cute jacket! Nice and soft and warm. The fuzzy on the outside is soft and it’s just fabric on the inside. The jacket is super cute, but the zipper doesn’t work very well. I think it’s just a very cheap zipper."
4.0,"Cute, small, simple."
4.0,Going through a Minnie only phase with my toddler and these are very cute. Fit well and decent quality.
4.0,Grandson loves it.  Runs a little large
4.0,does the job with ease
4.0,"Nice looking shirt, lots of compliments. Fabric is a woven and does not have any stretch or give."
4.0,The bunny suit/outfit itself fit pretty well. I was really worried that the outfit wouldn’t come with detachable straps but it did thankfully. The choker part of the outfit is very wonky and was a little bit confusing attaching the bow to it. The thigh high fish net socks didn’t fit at all which was a bummer
4.0,"Color wasn't as vibrant as pictures, fit was a little wonky. They fell out and eventually became lost."
4.0,"This necklace is simple and cute and decent quality. My only issue is that I wish you could make it a bit shorter, but even so it was exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,this is going to be a gift
4.0,"I did a search for PLUS SIZE clothes and most plus sizes on here don't go over a 3X. Which would be ok, if the items were true to size. But a 3X actually firs like a 1X."
4.0,"I loved this dress as it is gorgeous however, I had to return it as it has a solid poly underskirt and would be warm (fine for a winter event but would be too happy for my summer one.  Also there is no zipper, it is entirely done up with lacings in the back which is fine for those with a ladies maid on hand but those without an extra set of arms and eyes in the back of the head would have a very hard time getting into (and out of) this dress.  So ultimately, this is a beautiful and universal flattering dress  but the cost of having a hidden side zipper and a skirt slit (for air flow to cool under the heavy skirt) was too high so I regretfully returned the dress."
4.0,not very thick
4.0,Item was delivered on time and as described
4.0,Good quality but the ties are too short so it hurts to tie it
4.0,Fabulous dress..I am 5 foot 5 and 160 pounds and it fit perfect. I ordered a large. It is soft and comfortable to wear.
4.0,"After reading reviews on the product, I sized up (Went from a small to a medium). I am 5'4"", 110 lbs. It is actually still a bit snug, but the actual product is surprisingly well made for its price. Shipping was quick, and the packaging was very nice.<br />I do need it for the weekend, so I won't be returning it. But I will most likely be buying another one more size up, for future use."
4.0,The hat is perfect for the tea party I'm going to.
4.0,Qualty slipper at an affordable price.<br />Sizing is a bit too tight
4.0,Worked for our Halloween Costume.
4.0,"After reading a few reviews i decided to go with a size medium (i wear a large for everything) it does run a bit big, so go down a size for sure. Even the medium feels like i have a lot of room to move around (still would stick with a medium for myself) Thin material so it’s also see through too but nothing a cami cant solve! It is super comfortable and stretchy and there’s pockets! It doesn’t look like the first picture but more like the second one but i like it with a jean jacket so it works and with sandals. I’m 5’7 and it’s not super long on me- it hits right under my ankle-I’ll update with picture the next time i put it on."
4.0,"Colors will not be as vibrant as shown; at least mine isn't. But, nice addition to my classroom."
4.0,"Decent shades, though my main gripes are that they are very light (would have preferred a heavier wood, like ebony, if offered), and the light-coloured inside of the frames make for a distraction at the periphery of my vision. They noted in an email that they are looking to work with heavier woods, would be very interested to try some. Otherwise these are good shades."
4.0,"I absolutely love the necklace I received! I bought it to wear on my wedding day and cant wait to wear it with my dress. The necklace chain itself, is very dainty. I wish it was just a little bit bigger but all in all, I am happy with this product, and cant wait to start wearing it!"
4.0,Go a size up in the purchase these run a size small.
4.0,The color looks just like the picture and the dress fits well.
4.0,Bought as a gag gift for my nephew and he really loved how they looked and how well the molding fit!
4.0,"Wish these were a little thicker.  The fabric feels sort of 'cutting' , if you know what I mean.. needs a little padding on the bottom and to be thicker along the way. They work ok, I think..  I still have swelling ankles though."
4.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter to use with a small cross-body bag.
4.0,I purchased this hat to use while fishing on the boat. Being that it is early February and I live in central Illinois I haven't used it for that yet but it is well made and fits well. I feel that it will be perfect for my use which is to help keep the sun off my face and ears without being to hot.
4.0,Good looking strap. 4 stars because it is a little stiff. Still nice
4.0,"Cute top but is rather full in tummy area....if it would be just a smidge more form fitting, I would give it a 5 star. The embroidery is beautiful!"
4.0,It was nice just too thin
4.0,Its so beautiful on my son
4.0,"Ordered two sizes up (xxl), I’m normally a us L.<br />It’s still kind of short.<br />The sides are hemmed in a way that it is slightly scrunched in the sides (only noticeable a little).<br />Colors are as advertised.<br />Pretty comfy."
4.0,"Looks exactly as pictured, the fabric isn't weaved tightly so be careful not to get it caught on things or else it'll just start unthreading itself."
4.0,"We bought this as my husbands wedding band and it’s never caused us an issue. He works in house renovations and it hasn’t gotten scratched or damaged. Only thing we slightly dislike, which isn’t enough to go for another option, is that it’s pretty heavy. We still live it anyway. Very solid!"
4.0,"I originally gave this seller one star as my package appeared to go missing and I received no response to my request for a refund. But then out of the blue, my masks showed up in the mail today. The masks are super cool-looking although the stitching on a few is a little “wonky”. I purchased 10 different patterns and they came in slightly different sizes which ends up working perfectly for both my husband and I. I’m glad this purchase had a good outcome."
4.0,i like ti good
4.0,Definitely a good purchase. Good for traveling.
4.0,The dress fits well and is true to size but the seam below the smocking on the back needs elastic.  The seam does not stretch at all and cuts into you when sitting.
4.0,"The ants looked to small at first, I ordered a large and I am a size 14 US. The Pants fit perfectly!  I literally was going to return them, but I tried on the outfit and cancelled the return.  I actually strongly like this outfit"
4.0,Seems to be a nice quality for a pendent.  My previous chain got snagged and broke( by a totally different brand).
4.0,Looked amazing on my fiancee she liked it.
4.0,"I bought this for a closet cosplay and upon arrival I found the gloves were frayed very slightly on the hems of the finger holes but, honestly, I was expecting that and it was nothing a quick snip of some scissors couldn't fix! decent price for some decent gloves, I'd buy again if need be"
4.0,This dress fit my daughter well and looked beautiful. The only draw back was that the lining of the dress was a little short and left a line where it ended.
4.0,"This is made of  nice,  heavy cotton, well dyed and nicely silk-screened letters.  It's funny, too, as well as a conversation starter."
4.0,We got the large band.  It wasn’t as large as the original but it is a perfect fit for him. I’m going to order multiple colors now.
4.0,"Very cute, I got XL will use as bathing suit cover"
4.0,"I love flip flop slippers because I can't stand slippers covering my whole feet but the floor is too cold!<br />I thought these had great padding, at least enough for me.  They were very soft.  Size small fit my size 5 feet and I can see it fitting 6.<br /><br />Only issue is the top straps being loose.  I had to detach and resew at the front to make them tighter.  Other than that, great buy!<br />Btw, the gray is shimmery gray!! Nice touch!"
4.0,Bought as a backup watch as it is cheaper than watch bands!
4.0,"I bought a Small. I'm 5'5 and about 125 pounds. They fit at my natural waist, which is 26.5 inches, but it's a little tight. Otherwise they fit well in my legs and hit right at my ankle. They're flattering, and the material feels like microsuede. They don't seem sheer, but I'm not sure how they'll hold up in the wash. They do seem thin."
4.0,Love the skirt waistband was kinda tight but very  beautiful and I wore it to Renaissance Festival
4.0,Great set! Ideal for long days at the computer.
4.0,"I like this necklace however, the collar is not rounded so it does not lay well other than that the colors are great the workmanship is pretty good no missing beads I am pleased."
4.0,"I would order a full size bigger than your foot. However, I am in between a 7 and 7.5 but i went with the 7.5. It was still really small. Also, there isn't a buckle or anything really holding your foot in. The clasp is similar to how bra straps are connected to the bra itself. Other than that, i really like the color and style-i just wish it was true to size"
4.0,I wish the Green was more like the picture instead of being closer to brownish
4.0,"Super cute, but MUCH smaller than I expected. Color is bright and very pretty."
4.0,Super cute but could use more cushion underfoot. Would be uncomfortable standing for long periods of time.
4.0,"The watch is really beautiful, especially with this black dial with gold accents. The stainless metal was finished pretty well, just a few areas where you can see machining marks if you look close. The dial can look a very rich dark brown in certain light conditions outside.<br /><br />The bracelet is not great which is to be expected in a watch in this price range. The edges of the links are sharp and it doesn't have a very solid feel.<br /><br />The real &#34;problem&#34; with this watch is its size. 36mm is just too small, especially on my 7.75&#34; wrist. It looks like a ladies watch on me. I know this size is traditional for an Oyster model but it's much smaller than most other watches on the market these days.<br /><br />If you have a wrist under 7 inches and want something dressy I'd recommend this. The gold and the crystal indices really give it some understated bling."
4.0,"Fit well, but I would have liked it to be a little longer."
4.0,These are one of the softest pairs of leggings I own. They are warm and silky to the touch. The main issue with them are that they do go sheer after washing and go see through when bending over (they FAIL the squat test). These should only be worn in public if you do no want your underwear showing and your top does not cover your butt.
4.0,fit but a bit tight on legs
4.0,Great material but expected more for price and it Boeing from porsche
4.0,"Good material not pen not back just right, true the size"
4.0,"I had to order a size larger than I usually do.  Very comfortable dress.  The fabric is very stretchy, to the point that I feel like I can't hang it up or it will stretch it out."
4.0,"I did like that this was a unique pattern for a leather fitbit Charge 2 band. It just needs a few refinements.  But, it was good for the price."
4.0,"A little difficult to get the top on, other then that best retainer I’ve used."
4.0,"They are comfortable, warm, love the color pattern."
4.0,"Bought these for a trip to Florida, as I have lost many a sunglasses to the wave monsters! Nice fit, no problem with losing them this time! Good buy for the price.  Like the patriotic design as I am a Vet! God bless America!"
4.0,"I’ve been wearing this ring for about a month straight, washing my hands and sometimes bathing, and it has not turned colors yet. Feels great and the rhinestone is big and pretty!"
4.0,Bought it for someone. They commented it is a heavy piece of jewelry and can be uncomfortable/possibly stretch the piercing.
4.0,Looks great...but it keeps falling off my ear.
4.0,"Masks are a great fit for my 6yo. They are soft and comfortable enough for her to wear all day in school. They also hold up well after being washed. They appear to be well made, however one has broken already after only the second wear. One of the straps popped off while in school."
4.0,Too big!  Is there anyway to shorten it?
4.0,"These frames are wonderful for the price paid for them. The glasses did come with the demo lenses that have etching in them, but I knew I would be getting prescription lenses so that didn't bother me. The frames are a little bit wider then my face but not bothersome. I was able to adjust to them after a couple days of wearing them. I would recommend these to those looking for a fashionable new pair of glasses."
4.0,"I liked how it was fun , it looked like a whole proper  outfit that was styled when in reality  I just threw on a boxy dress, I’ve received compliments. I like to wear it with white sneakers like vans or talll boots. I like things a little boxy so I sized up, I think you should size up when ordering lower proced items !"
4.0,Not exactly what I expected. Laces are glittery and not very nice but can always get different ones.
4.0,Fabric could be better quality
4.0,I really didn't pay attention to the dimensions of this i just liked the style and thought it would be perfect for my husband.  with that said it's pretty small!  it will be enough for him to pack his few bath items but if you had much it probably wouldn't work for that.  i do like that there are different compartments and it seems very durable.
4.0,"Keep my shoes  nice and lose, and in shape."
4.0,"I love mesh fabric and hoped I would like this swimming suit.  It is partially lined with mesh panels.  I like the mesh but don’t care for the rear-end not being lined.  The alternating mesh panels and solid fabric creates many seams.  These seams are rather raw and not finished very well plus they are uncomfortable on my stomach. The waistband on the bottoms is very narrow and cuts into my stomach as well.  I love the nylon/spandex fabric.  It is my favorite material combination and a traditional swimsuit material.  The material is a lighter weight and feels like good quality. The suit bottom has a somewhat strange cut at least when I’m wearing them.  They have a super high waist with a bunch of coverage for the stomach and yet at the same time they are very cheeky.  Its more cheek showing than I like. It doesn’t look like that on the model in the photos so maybe I got the wrong size.  For reference I am 40/36/39, 6’ tall and 187 pounds. I couldn’t find a size chart, so I selected my normal size XL. The bottoms fit ok other than the cheeks issue but maybe the large would have been better for me. As far as tummy control, I got zero from this suit. After 5 minutes of wearing the tummy section slides down to my waist and all I got is a bundle of fabric around my waist with no mesh showing. Not good.<br />The top is lined in the front plus has round pads to create a cup shape for the suit  The suit fabric is just a flat piece that is expected to stretch around your breasts. This is not my favorite design as I much prefer a bra with either darts or seams to create a cup shape. The bra is large enough for D size without the pads.<br /><br />Overall, and okay swimming suit, might fit someone else better than my body type. It needs a sizing chart and suspenders to hold up the tall waist.  I wouldn’t buy again."
4.0,I think she will like it for Christmas It is want she has been wanting
4.0,"These lacy masks are fun for any Halloween party or masquerade! The lace isn't super thin, but it's not super durable either. The ribbon seemed plenty long to tie it on, and the designs were all very different. I would make sure to store them in a flat box, otherwise the lace pieces tend to stick out in random directions instead of laying nice and flat against your face. Otherwise it's a fun purchase and I liked having options to choose from! Also great because you have extra if a friend needs one!"
4.0,It's beautiful but mine was teared up a little
4.0,My watch that I had intended for it did not work but I<br />had another that it per perfectly for.
4.0,Bought these for my husband and he really likes them.  The only problem is the new his feet get hot.  Wish the inside lining wasn’t all  flannel or had a cool gel pad underneath the lining.  They are made very well too.
4.0,I'm 5'9&#34; 240 and I got into it but it was tight around the leg area. I got a xl and if there was a 2xl it wuda been perfect but I still turned heads.
4.0,Nice wallet but you can't fit a lot in it without it bulging.
4.0,"Boots are super comfertable ,color is Awsome looks well made on problem is I don't have super skinny calfs sooo they are really tight but just need to be strecthed out I guess until then I won't be able to pull them up all the way. All in all I am happy with the boots"
4.0,"They arrived quick, they look good and seem to be built well. The metal frame is sturdy and the polarization on the lenses is nice. The mirror is reflective enough that you can't see your eyes in the mirror.  Even came with a little polarization tester which was fun to play with for a minute.<br /><br />I ordered the gunmetal frame which is very dark compared to what I was expecting, almost black. They frame itself is a tad on the small size for me, but that's probably just personal preference."
4.0,needs better material but still gets the job done
4.0,Dress does not flatter. Structure feels stiff and bulky. I feel it makes me look bigger than i am. It served its purpose ndmay fit better on small framed body type
4.0,I liked the style but runs smaller then expected.
4.0,"Ordered 8 ties for a wedding. The quality is surprisingly good for the cost. The ties arriving over a week late caused a great deal of stress, however. Overall, 3 weeks for the ties to arrive. Plan accordingly. 5 stars if it wasn't for that."
4.0,"Pretty, wings are iridescent, well made, 2 inches long. A little on the heavy side for me. (I have small ears) but will keep them. Took one star off because of the weight."
4.0,Look great but dodnt come with backs and didnt stay ahold of ur ear very good
4.0,"I wore this dress for a very elegant wedding & I loved it! Received many compliments and my boyfriend thought I looked gorgeous. The only downside is that the material can be easily damaged so you have to be careful when putting on and taking off. We did a lot of dancing at the wedding, and due to the length of the dress (long tail at the end) I had to pick up the bottom of the dress in order to be able to dance. Besides those two small factors it was a great dress, especially for the price."
4.0,"Love the pattern and cut of the dress, not a fan of the material. Im a L/LX, ordered a XL for safe keeping, it does not have any stretch in the material. Im 6ft 188lbs if not off the shoulder i would not be able to wear as a dress"
4.0,"Actually love it, the rose gold is beautiful and the quality of the metal seems good. The band is terrible. It's long and wraps around the wrist before buckling, a double loop type arrangement. The face rubbed off the finish in just a few hours of wear. Don't double wrap it, just trim it off. I'm going to get a better band since I really do like the color and design."
4.0,Keep my toes warm for the winter months @ yoga...love all the colors. The grips on the bottom also help your feet from sliding. Great 👍🏻 product...a job well done.
4.0,"These pants are comfy yet have enough of a professional look that I am able to wear them at the office. I ordered a small and it fit true to size, although I am a short 5’1” and they are a bit long (I’m used to clothes fitting this way)."
4.0,Great  for kayaking and camping.
4.0,"I love the style, the quality on these shoes. I kept ordering larger and larger sizes so they would fit, but without success. These shoes are about 2-3 sizes too small. I really wished they would have fit."
4.0,"Super soft and comfy, but really long. I’ll need to hem them but it’s worth it."
4.0,Very pretty. A little smaller that i expected. Arrived sooner than expected. I like that an extra claw was added in the packaging so that i can add it to the dress loops. :)
4.0,"Looks cute and worked well for a deer costume. The band tended to slide around and down a bit on a 2 year old, but was soft and a good costume accessory overall."
4.0,"Two things good about this cap, it’s cute, and it has the mesh at the back that provide breathable air.  However, there is one problem, the cap is made with some kind of material that’s a big harder than what I would like, so it’s not that comfortable."
4.0,These are perfect for my 5 year old grandson well made
4.0,I like the tortoise shell look and that they are big and lightweight. Perfect for summer.
4.0,"It’s a nice cardigan. Nice material. I ordered a large which is what I usually wear,  but could have got away with a medium.  Very cute. I’d definitely order this brand again."
4.0,Perfect! Son loved them.
4.0,This is a perfect summer/vacation romper. The only con i can see is the fabric is thin & a bit transparent - its not sheer but it is very airy & light. I would recommend buying this  - i really enjoyed the fact that it has a discreet button & loop to keep the bust area from flying open (no safety pin needed) or if you want to let the girls hang out you have that option too :) i really love the leg slits & the fact that it ties at the bottom around ur ankle .. looks great with flats wedges or heels  easy to wear with everything. The fit is nice as well not too tight or too loose
4.0,"This is well made and I like that the sleeves are detachable since without the sleeves, it is still large enough to cover my daughters shoulders (like a t-shirt). My only complaint is that I purchased this for nap time in the summer when she's in short sleeve onesies but wanted something to cover her arms. However,  the material is actually very heavy and more suitable for winter. Like a heavy cotton. Will keep for the fall/winter."
4.0,"I didn't like it, but my wife does. She kept it instead of letting me send it back.  I'm 6'3"" and slender. She's 5'9"" and nicely curvy. It fit both of us. My main issue was that, zipped up, the neck and hood were just kinda in the way of my chin."
4.0,"Not plastic, no chain, decent shipping speed. It's not the best, but I've seen much worse. It does seem synthetic but maybe I'm just too skeptical."
4.0,little thin on the material
4.0,hard to screw on but they are cute! black color will fade after 2 month's wear.
4.0,"Decently surprised that these fit my calves, which are huge"
4.0,"Very nice, high quality piece. Not sure if the thin rope will last a long time. Definitely worth the price."
4.0,Great wallet for the essentials.  Wish it had a coin holder.
4.0,"Had to send it back, it was too tight - bathing suits are so tricky! I'm 5'3&#34;, 175 lbs and I have a muffin top. The leg openings were a slightly higher cut than I thought they would be; my &#34;muffin&#34; was trying to creep-out (sorry for the visual!). Upside, the suit looks to be well-made. Oh, and I usually wear a size 14."
4.0,"What more is there to say? Slightly smaller than most of my scarves, but big enough to wrap around my neck once, twice if I tuck the ends in"
4.0,Only thing is that they run small. So order up! I'm 5'1 and 155lbs I'm usually always a medium in leggings!
4.0,"Love the way this dress fits!!! Top stretches, pockets are great! Skirt portion need ironed prior to wearing but looks amazing."
4.0,"Love these bras, it would be 5 stars if the straps were a little tighter"
4.0,Cute shirt.  Ordered an XL and it fit like a L tho
4.0,"Is perfect for the winter, I have used it in very cold nights and is the best. I don't give 5 stars because could be bigger, if doesn't  fit as the picture, any way it cover all my head."
4.0,They’re not for you if you have a thick wrist.  Luckily my wife has an Apple Watch.  She loves the colors
4.0,Fits rather larger then anticipated. Could've done with a XL. Served it's purpose during the winter time.
4.0,"I’m 5,0” 117lbs, 34c slim fit body type. It’s a light pleather jacket it’s honestly super cute but it was just too big on me I normally don’t purchase size small when it comes to jackets for women they tend to fit big but read some of the reviews stating it’s smaller than the stated size. There is just no way that is true this jacket fit like a true small which unfortunately means I have to return it since it fits me big. Having said that I would recommend it for summer, fall fashion. It’s thin and enough.<br /><br />**the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like maybe it would last but it’s pretty thin so not for very long."
4.0,"This dress is cute, and I've received many compliments on it. It is loose fitting and perfect for summer, except the material is a little heavy for my liking."
4.0,"I like the dress but to me it's kind of a one-occasion type of dress. I don't think the quality is made for long term, but if you want a dress for a summer party or casual wedding... it's a great buy. I got the green color and it looked just like the picture."
4.0,Was gift for daughter. She likes them.
4.0,Cute enough
4.0,Daughter n law loved them
4.0,"Great hat,very light weight"
4.0,"Great product, comfy briefs, order arrived fast. Price was a little high — these are underwear, not silk ties or alligator skin boots. But fine quality, I’d order them again."
4.0,"These pants fit really well, flatter the shape, and are very comfortable. I love the pockets, since most yoga pants I've had in the past either didn't have them or failed to integrate them in a flattering way. Great for lounging or casual wear."
4.0,The trees work well up to their recommended size but not a bit over.
4.0,This is a nice ring.  Its not going to pass for high end but its an elegant piece.  I esoecially like its width.  I dont like that the black and gold inset spins but this is not apparent to the casual onlooker. All in all a nice stylish ring.
4.0,"The hat is too large for my head, but it does look good."
4.0,"Fabulous as usual although because they're higher than the toddler boots, they seem to fit a big more snugly. I love how flexible they are. My kids can really play in these!"
4.0,"Muy hermoso vestido, me encanto.."
4.0,The problem with these one size fits all (?) tanning pouches is that it’s not popular enough to warrant various sizes so you hope you can make it work for you. From experience with this one and a couple others I own the bigger your “package” the happier you will be with the fit. They need to make these out of stretchier material so they will conform to the individual wearers package. The trick with this one is that after you cinch the closer as tight as possible you then need to tie a knot or bow to keep the closer from slipping. Overall OK for tanning but not OK for walking any distance.
4.0,"Cute socks. Fabric is thick and soft, but a little too tight at the top for me, personally."
4.0,The lining is noisy. You definitely get what you pay for. Outside of bag is cute though!
4.0,Button holes could be bigger but very nice quality
4.0,NICE WATCH...LOVE THE THIN DESIGN!
4.0,Awesome value and it performs just as well as the expensive ones.
4.0,"Gave to boyfriend for Christmas. He put it on his key chain right away. It's kind of small so it doesn't take up much space which is either a plus or minus depending. Good that it isnt bulky, but bad since the whole text would have fit better on a wider piece of metal. It's too small to stand out."
4.0,"Good product, but the golden thing at the front of the mask started falling after 5 uses."
4.0,not what i was looking for -- thought the pineapples would actually glitter -- but it is just a picture not glitter
4.0,"Great socks for the price, many fun colors and patterns."
4.0,"Love the length, perfect with leggings and boots. Color  is perfect.  A bit tight in the chest."
4.0,"Looks good, solid feel and weight"
4.0,The size it's is streck l.  Is size large really its medium
4.0,basic swing dress
4.0,"This stuff is good. Love the design, the smaller size fits me perfectly and gives my keys a stylish high quality minimalist look without adding bulk or noise. Everything is held tightly in a beautiful, seemingly sturdy leather case. Fits your palm and pocket."
4.0,Great size and leather quality; the only caveat is that the color is starting to wear at the edges of the bag and I have only had it about 6 weeks.
4.0,Pretty and Breathable. Size up cause these China made shoes run small. Fresh green and cream design.
4.0,Fits and looks cute on my daughter...she’s 5’3” and 125 and I think it’s a M. It’s thicker than I thought and I liked that but it’s fairly cheap so I don’t think it’ll last. It’s a great fashion piece for a season or two though so I’m Happy I got it.
4.0,It looked nicer in the description. Cheaper in hand but I will take it.
4.0,"I bought these as I always loved the glasses Michael Weston wore on Burn Notice. Those were discontinued years ago, but these make a solid approximation of the original. The hue of the lens isn't as deep as the cognac color of the ones worn in the series, but these are still quite stylish. 4 stars as they only do a decent job of actually blocking sunlight, but for me at least these were bought with form over function in mind."
4.0,"I wanted to like this suit for its style and color, but the bottom is too big for me. I'm 99lbs and 5'2''and a S doesn't fit well every where. It's more like a M. But the suit is beautiful and of nice material."
4.0,"5'5, 215lb and 35wks with my third son ordered 2xl and covers the whole pregnancy belly plus a couple inches. Fits a little funky around the chest, the green panel sits under bust line, some loose stitching but the polyester blend held up in two regular wash cycles. The material is like a light sweater and I like the length of the sleeves as they reach my thumb knuckle, that's saying something as I have wide shoulders."
4.0,"they are very nice, quite soft and I just wish  but the fingers weren't too long for me.  i measured using the chart  and looked at reviews  i might return them or keep them,  not sure yet  I will<br />sleep on it  Maybe the chart should have us measure length of our fingers too"
4.0,It did the job. Pretty cute made my accessories for my baby shower pop. Only complaint was it is slightly uncomfortable and a little baggy on the neck but still a very beautiful outcome 👌🏽(Sorry for the quality of the pic but if you look closely right under the happy face you'll see the choker 😂) I'll try to post a better one later.
4.0,It was a very nice replacement for my watch band
4.0,"The dress is nice, but a little smaller than I expected. I will probably send it back for the next size up."
4.0,I've use the socks for 5 days and so far they work well. Only one foot hurts and after a few hours my foot feels find. I like them so far I might buy more.
4.0,lovely and worked. Got it as a gift and my GF who is always late loved the gag
4.0,Prrfect
4.0,Prom<br />(She looked gorgeous)<br />Very pleased.
4.0,I liked this purse except for the color that I ordered. The size was not too big or too small and I liked the number of pockets it had. I returned it after I didn't like the Cyan Blue color that I ordered. That is a personal preference though and I would/plan to order another in a different color. I think I would have liked the color more of the straps were a darker brown.
4.0,"These ear ring are smaii for me ,but prefect for a small for a small child .Really cute."
4.0,This Tournesol one piece is a nice family friendly swimsuit that has a little bit of sexiness with the deep v-neck.<br />It seems to be well made and the material is pretty thick.  Sizing was perfect as I normally wear a medium in swim suits and this fit perfect.
4.0,"I would actually give this bag 4.5 ⭐️s.<br />I love the deep rich green color, good organization with center zip pocket, quality leather; bag looks more expensive than priced.<br />I did not like that it’s a bit heavy, very stiff which makes the zippered top closure open less and accessing inside the bag a little difficult.<br />Overall, this bag is worth the price and I’m happy with the purchase!"
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34;, around 160 lbs, about a size 10-12 US, more toward a 12.  Based on reviews, I ordered a XXL and it fits perfectly.  Very cute and flattering.  Only criticism is the gathering between the breasts is off-center, but I wasn't expecting perfection for this price.  I haven't worn it in the water yet, so we'll see how it holds up.  Will definitely order from Cocoship again!"
4.0,"Super cute love the color!! However, I did cut the little bows off on the straps because they did look cheap but very minor and an easy fix!"
4.0,It's really great fabric but it slides open to the sides
4.0,Keep this cloth in your jewelry case and you can use ti before you put a piece on or after you remove it.  Keeping it handy is the idea.  I have ordered a couple of them to keep in multiple places to keep my jewelry sparking and ready to wear.  The size is nice and the finish is good.  You will appreciate this small item for all the good it does to keep your jewelry sparking.
4.0,One way for me to rep my culture all day.
4.0,I actually lived the
4.0,Fits properly but restricts your movement a tiny bit.
4.0,Color and fit are both professional looking.
4.0,Flattering shape and comfortable but material is a bit like a uniform texture that looks creased.  I wish it was more feminine material
4.0,"Comfortable fit, took it on a trip and it travels fine"
4.0,light weight and easy to clasp.  Much better than the watchband style
4.0,Small and cute. It took me a few minutes to screw the end on. But i got it and i love how it looks
4.0,Good one until now
4.0,"The one band is a bit on the heavy side. But they are very nice.  Just hope they stay this shiny and don't ""tarnish"""
4.0,"I get complements every time I wear this! It is a thin material and wrinkles easily, which is why it does not get 5 stars from me. But at the price, I’ll take it!"
4.0,"This product is a nice designed product for use during the current mask mandates across the world.  It is comfortable and easily washable.  The material doesn't seem too thick, so I tend to double up around my mouth and nose for extra protection.  The ear loops help keep this mask from sliding down your face.  I do recommend this!"
4.0,"Honestly I wish it held a little more, but it fits my 2 insurance cards, 5 IDs, 3 loyalty cards, and 1 debit card with minimal issue. Fits nicely in my front pocket."
4.0,Perfect for 2/6
4.0,"These socks are nice, but won't stay up."
4.0,"If you like big roomy pajamas these are for you.Theyre also very warm so i can only wear them on super cold nights, ive washed them a lot and theyre still soft not stiff like some others i have."
4.0,Fits nicely and expresses a feeling in a sweet way.
4.0,"I’m 5’8 very athletic. Large strong legs and small waist, so this onesie fit well other than in the torso. The low back area did not hug my curves rather made it straight as a board which made me look like I had no butt. Haha. But I hemmed it with darks and stitching so I fixed it. I recommend the outfit %100 if you know how to sew properly. Very flattering, bright, and stretchy. Going to the bathroom is a potential struggle if you have no one to unzip you. Haha."
4.0,The spot did wash out.
4.0,The earrings were cute but smaller than I expected based on the pictures
4.0,"I like these, but they fit a little different than expected. The ankles are smaller than I thought, while the legs were roomier than expected. Good product though!"
4.0,"I was a bit dubiou when these arrived, as they seemed a bit lighter than what I needed for walking the dog.  But so far they've done very well. However so far it's been a mild winter :)  So the 5th star is waiting for 20 degree days. Very comfy."
4.0,Paint wears down a litt bit but overall great
4.0,"I have put a lot of weight on between a broken leg at the beginning of the pandemic and that in itself. I ordered a XXL because I wanted it super loose. It was a little to loose for even what I wanted, great short though and I will be buying another to wear probably in a Large for still loose but not so loose I can wear it as a nightgown"
4.0,"This dress is comfortable for me to wear and I have received several compliments when wearing it. Its flowy where it needs to be and fitting in the right places as well. Great, beautiful dress."
4.0,"Nice product, just a little short for my liking."
4.0,Top fit good. I ordered  a large and it is fitted but not super tight. Unfortunately I wanted an actual white top so I may return it.
4.0,Short but so soft
4.0,"These pants are nice enough to wear as daily casual wear.  I purposely waited until I had washed them before writing my review.  They came out of the dryer wrinkle free and I will soon determine how well the fabric responds for travelling.  I suspect they will do quite well as the fabric is similar to another pair of slacks I have that travels wrinkle free both riding in the car and in packing.  The fabric is very light weight which is a plus for summer wear.  I was a little disappointed in the top of the waist band.  The elastic rolled a little when the pants were removed from the dryer and I had to insure that the elastic at the top of the waist band was flat around the top.  But it was a quick fix and a minor inconvenience.  They did not shrink and I love the boot cut.  Other than the elastic issue, they appear to be well made.  So I would recommend them as a purchase with a disclaimer about the elastic around the top of the waist band."
4.0,"I ordered a 2xl following the reviews. I'm 5'4&#34; and 152 lbs. It was very big. I am thinking a L would be perfect. The skirt on this dress is long and flowy. A bit below the knee on me. The fabric of the skirt is heavy and not see through, but still moves well. The stitching is good as well. I really like the dress so I oredered another size. I ordered a very similar dress from another shop...same style, but vivid colors on the skirt part and very short...so this is a good alternative for when I want to show less leg. This dress does show more lower back."
4.0,Very heavy for really cold weather. Runs much larger than the thinner button up sweaters I have over 20 Grace Karin various types and I’m usually a 2x but in this sweater I wear a large. Still plenty big.
4.0,It’s for a Xmas gift. I’m sure she’s going to love it.
4.0,Super cute costume. Took a star off for there not being any size labels. Ordered 2 different sizes for my daughters and couldn’t tell which was which once they were out of the packet. And the socks that came with it are very small.
4.0,Loved it but medium was more on the bigger side. Could’ve done better with a small. Good thing I have a sewing machine. Material is nice and washed well.
4.0,"It fits.  Color is what I was I wanted (Navy).  It does stick on my long sleeve clothes like when I put jackets on due to the slightly rubbery texture to it.  The biggest draw back is that it has to be removed in order to charge the Amazfit.  I had read so many reviews on different covers that I must have confused which review applied to which cover because I thought I would be able to charge the Amazfit with the cover on which is pretty ridiculous on my part considering that the back covers everything but the blood pressure sensor which is actually one of the reasons I bought this one.  In order to remove this cover I also have to remove the band which makes me worry the band latch may wear out from repeatedly taking it off and on.  Luckily, the Amazfit has good battery life and does not need to be charged that often.  As long as one does not mind removing their band and cover to charge your watch this protects the watch well and adds a nice color."
4.0,"I like it, very cute."
4.0,I like it. Could use a little more room to fit my phone in it in the case but other than that. Love it!
4.0,Bought it for my daughter....she loves it.
4.0,"I like the length  and the fabric. It stretches, so it moves with you. The only thing I didn’t like is the waist a bit looser  than what I expected."
4.0,it was so cute! Nothing bad about it!
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and  this  dress  is long for  me. It is  a beautiful  flowy  dress, I wore  it  on  my  niece's  beach  wedding  and  it's  just  perfect. The  quality  of  this  dress  is decent."
4.0,pretty but for club or party something that only lasts a little bit
4.0,"Fit fine, material is fine, warmth is fine, but there's something about the look of these boots. Makes me feel like I'm Napoleon Dynamite."
4.0,The XL was a little tighter than expected so I gave it to my mother-in-law who’s 1 size smaller than me.  She said they fit her perfectly.  All in all the material and cut is nice the drawstrings were long enough to use comfortably without losing them in the waistband.  The pockets are deep enough for your hands and the length is great it actually comes down to the top of the knee. The stitching is well done so it looks like the shorts will last a long time through lots of wearings.  I would still rate these shorts with high marks.
4.0,Very satisfied w/ my purchase.  Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"Love these shirts, great value. I just wish they were offered in an XS."
4.0,Haven't worn it yet but it seems as if it will work well.
4.0,"Its way cheaper than the others, but definitely is cheap. Few stitches pulled and few stops that just look like some fabric is missing or is just scuffed a little. So comfortable like extremely which i was surprised about how much these didn’t hurt my feet and i don’t usually wear heals that often. Good for the price and if you’re like me and like good prices i would get even though they’re a little scuffed up."
4.0,"Great buy.  Hard to find ""Ping Pong"" or ""indoor court"" shoes of this quality for less than $75-$100.  Since they are new, I can't say how long they will last at this point, but they appear to be well made.  Designed with good support; my foot feels ""secure"" in these shoes.  Nice grippy soles. I recommend you buy one size larger than your normal US shoe size.  I'm a US size 10.5 - but I bought size 11.5 and they fit just right."
4.0,"Like it, a bit small. So far good quality"
4.0,I purchased these as a gift for my mom to go with a necklace I had purchased from a different seller. The quality is much better than a different pair I purchased previously from a different seller. They are a little smaller than what I thought they were but they match the pendant perfectly. You would never know they were not meant to be a set.
4.0,It fits good but I wish I ordered it a size larger... I prefer alittle extra room...over all I like it..
4.0,"This is a very cute dress and I am happy with it. The material is a stretchy spandex-type fabric, which I wasn't expecting but is not necessarily a bad thing. The back is too low for me to wear a bra with it. I don't mind not wearing one, but if I can find a nice backless bra, I will wear the dress a lot more often."
4.0,"shoes are very cute, my son loves it and he is very excited for receiving the little decorations."
4.0,Shorter then expected but very sexy and soft!
4.0,"It's comfortable! I like that the straps do not dig in. I like that the cups are supportive. I'm not crazy about having to pull this on over my head, but I knew before I ordered it that it's made that way. I have worn it under a lightweight fabric blouse, and there's no showthrough."
4.0,"Cute dress! I’m 5’6” and roughly 165lb and the large fit a bit tight. Very flattering, but order up a size."
4.0,"As much as I wanted to love this top, the sizes run really small.  Beautiful colors and the material was nice. Not too thin and the style was very cute. Just wish they ran larger."
4.0,This is a pretty design and the stone is a lovely blue.  It will make a great gift for a teenager.
4.0,Nice bag - a bit pricey but perfect size for iPhone  iPad and other items ladies need to carry in their everyday bag
4.0,"Love, love the dress. Fits a little bit tight on the waist, but I'm keeping it. Bright colors and very good style."
4.0,Bought this to add to some of these brackets that I had. They took a while to arrive but I had no problem with that. The first time I wore it one of the blue gems came off but I easily stuck it back with super glue. That's the only reason I took off one star. Otherwise these bracelets are pretty and I like them. I may even get some more to add to my own.
4.0,"Nice little affordable tent; fabulous color. The materials are a bit less than expected and very thin. The door netting snagged upon first use. I used the tent as a single person with two small bags, and it was cozy. I cannot imagine how three persons would fit into this tent; two persons may fit if they know each other very well and aren't traveling with luggage. What the tent lacks in some areas, it more than makes up for with the best tent color ever."
4.0,Green is better described as turquoise color. Thinking about having these for my bridesmaids but not as green as I’d like. I still might buy them for the maids but I’m going to search around for something more close green. Picture is bracelet next to my maid’s dress. Bracelet is good quality though.
4.0,"This is a well made item. The color is beautiful. because it is too big and too heavy to me, I have to return it"
4.0,Sizes varied.
4.0,"Very cute suit, well made with good material. Sad it didn't work out for me.  I'm a petite small and it fit well, just didn't WOW me on.  But returns and refunds are excellent and quick!"
4.0,Great colors. Almost to small for glasses to fit in.
4.0,"a little flimsy, still looks good"
4.0,"Beautiful pure white dress. Fits well, comfortable. However, the dress had a hole in it. I didn’t realize it until I was at my event and got dressed. SO embarrassing.<br /><br />The stitching wasn’t in tact. Please check seams if you purchase this dress. Overall, it’s still a nice dress"
4.0,"Shirt is nice love the color, I'm 5'8 127lbs small chest and a small fits perfect just wish it was longer is kinda too short for my taste but a high waist skirt shorts or Jean's will do!"
4.0,"~Measurements: 5'6, 115lbs, 16"" shoulder, 33"" bust, 26"" waist, 35"" hips, bra 36A, tops: S fitted, M casual~ I purchased up at an XL because I wanted to get as close to the pic as I could. As other reviews state no matter the size the hole are not as big as pictured. This is true however I found that by pulling the shirt into a knot, it opens them up a bit. I like this shirt. The cost is low. The material is light and slinky. I can wear it tied up, crop, or long and lazy. Ita going to be great in the summer with my strappy sports bras or swim tops."
4.0,Love the length very comfortable
4.0,"Fits as expected, and will purchase more. I nice under shirt."
4.0,Run very small and are a little thin.
4.0,Works very nicely keeping  the beads in place..I am recommending it highly and am going to order more thank you
4.0,Liked the dress
4.0,Very shiny and nice.
4.0,the product is nice i am dumb and did not read the discription for the length of the bar and it is too short for my monroe piercing i ordered new bars and will be using the stones with my new bars
4.0,"So I like the design of the Bell&Ross BR1, but I don't feel inclined to pay mega-bucks for a brand that mostly uses standard ETA movements. With this watch, you get similar rugged looks, a proprietary shock absorption system that seems like a gimmick but could prove useful, a solid ETA movement, and a nice case with plenty of case candy (2 additional wristbands, for one). Oh, and for a fraction of the price of a BR. I am sold."
4.0,"Nice hat, a shade too big, have ordered hatbands to improve the fit."
4.0,"bought for Adult F (generally wear a size small); used for my Halloween costume, was quite a hit amongst the children I work with and random Waikiki persons.  Not the greatest quality but certainly held up and I predict I will be able to use quite a few more times without issue.<br />The 'feet' may not fit bigger sizes, I'm a size 6 women's and the elastic to secure to the toes was somewhat uncomfortable, the Velcro around my ankles barely wrapped fully.<br />the 'tail' fit my waist when fully adjusted to the smallest circumference.<br />'Beak' elastic is adjustable, headband fit as normal."
4.0,Came as discribed
4.0,"This is a review of Knitee Women's Retro Business Square Neck Ruffle Slit Party Cocktail Dress (Pink, Medium).<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Thick material<br />+Comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Requires a certain body frame to fit properly<br />===<br />The dress itself is well made--it's made with thick material and comfortable to wear (so my wife says), and washes / dries in a typical manner. The only issue with the dress is you need to be at least moderately endowed in order for it to fit properly, so not every body shape will fit. I'd suggest ordering down a size if you like it enough."
4.0,With the right shoes it’s a nice special occasion outfit
4.0,Wear these to the ballpark all of the time.  Have received many compliments.  They're not too big but you can certainly make out the baseball earring that I'm wearing.  Would buy these again for myself or as a gift for a fellow baseball mom.
4.0,I ordered mediums and they’re a bit of a squeeze to get over my hand but once they are on I love the way they fit. My golf glove size is cadet medium large if that helps anyone.
4.0,a very attractive T !
4.0,I like this one also
4.0,Too small. Came only up to belly button so squeezed tummy over it! Though they would come up higher to right under bra strap.
4.0,True to size. I will buy another one in a different color
4.0,Great dance leotard
4.0,"If I end up switching to scrubs, it'll still look cool with what I did with it.<br />And it's so cozy."
4.0,This is such an unique find. I promise you will be the only person in the room wearing this dress. I ordered the black and burgundy. I wasn't a big fan of the burgundy so I will be returning it. I prefer the black one. Please do not size up. I'm 10/12 and ordered L and XL. The XL made me look like I was pregnant. The L was just fine.
4.0,"Great bag.  Wish the internal pocket was a bit stiffer.  It collapses so its not as easy to find things.  Otherwise, for the price, it looks good and does what its suppose to do."
4.0,"This so cute for the kids' room. It came apart after a wash, but putting it back together was easy."
4.0,These looked so good on my daughter's feet. However they do run a little big but I don't mind.
4.0,"Beutiful, but heavy, not very convinient in use"
4.0,"Love this dress! I ordered 2 sizes up and I’m glad I did! It fits perfectly! It’s marked XL when purchasing through amazon, but the dress is really a size medium as printed on the inside tag. The only thing I wish were different was the wideness is the sleeves. My forearms are pretty tiny and they drown in these sleeves. Overall great dress! Definitely worth the price and the wait!!"
4.0,They looked and felt great and stayed up for the most part.
4.0,Great color and style!
4.0,These are so great. They're only able to be used once or twice because they get stretched out.
4.0,"I love the dress, just wished it was cotton it can get hot wearing this."
4.0,"This review is for the yuepang Blank Football Jersey for Men, Mesh Polyester Plain Sports T-Shirt Hip Hop Jersey S-4XL, delivered on time and in perfect condition from Amazon.<br /><br />This is a nice quality jersey, need to size up one size as runs, at least for me a little small."
4.0,Too short and a little tight
4.0,Well made apron.  A tad shorter than I expected.  Im 5'4&#34; and it covers to the top of my hip. For a tall person it wouldn't be enough coverage.
4.0,"I love the fabric and the shape of this suit, but it didn't work for me and I had to return it.  I ordered according to the chart and even up a little because of the reviews but it was just loose and weird in the rear area.  It's hard to order a swimsuit online without trying it on and I'm sure it's working well for some, but didn't work out for me.  It is basically a modest swimsuit but the back portion rode up a bit and I certainly want that covered.  The top and the sleeves are very nice and cover very well.  The pattern on the fabric is very cute and I really wanted it to work, but oh well."
4.0,They are a great product. You just have to be mindful they don't fall out
4.0,"if your face is a small adult, order a small"
4.0,love this keychain
4.0,Great price. Nice item. I ordered a 2nd because I liked the style. Order arrived quickly and as expected.
4.0,"Awesome prints! Soft material and well constructed. I love these and have bought six pair to wear as kind of stylish long-johns layered under ripped jeans. Very cool look. I love them VERY much, so it pains me to take away a star, but they should be more color fast. They're starting to fade a bit and I've only washed them about five times."
4.0,Little bigger than I expected but still beautiful chiffon like material.
4.0,"The wallet is incredibly slim and stylish. Having only 6 pockets forces me to be thoughtful about what I put in my pocket.<br /><br />After a year's usage, There is a little play between the rubber and the plastic pieces. Nothing has broken, but the wallet feels like it COULD break."
4.0,"Not true to size; inside layer is perfect, but the outside finger tips are too long. It makes it hard to pickup things and touch screen it impossible."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:99af0c8cfa608a3cf26af919fddca2e7]] 4/5 Rating<br /><br />This watch looks great online and when you open it up. Once you pick it up it feels somewhat cheap.  I like that it comes in a nice box and it is easy to operate. Mine came with no directions whatsoever so I'm not completely sure how to remove links to properly adjust. I'm sure Youtube would be able to help.<br /><br />Overall it's a pretty good looking watch.. I'm more accustomed top a little more weight being on the watch head. But overall it's decent. Feels slightly cheap but doesn't look cheap.
4.0,"I like these shoes - they're good, not great.  Totally fine for the price.  My biggest complaint is it's easy to 'fall off' the heel (slide to the side) because they don't fit very tightly.  I have the strap on the tightest hole.  I think I'm going to punch another hole into the strap to see if that helps them stay put better."
4.0,My boys like them. And use them for football
4.0,"I love these dancing tights. Very great quality and is very thick. When they say 40 denier they mean it! The color is true black and in fact is pitch black. Have not washed it yet so not sure how it'll survive it. The waistband is a little too tight on me. However, it's not so bad."
4.0,I used this dress for my court wedding and I was very pleased with the material. It was itchy by my beck and arms but nothing too unbearable. I was 5 months pregnant in this dress so I went for a medium and It fit perfectly. I’m typically a small. It was long for me given that I am 4’11” so I had to alter it. But if you’re taller then the length will be perfect. Only issue I had was that the zipper part got stuck and ripped a little but I was able to solve that issue.
4.0,"This Adjustable Ski Mask is soft, breathable and comfortable, it's also lightweight, can help you keep warm in winter days, good for skiing, fishing, hunting etc. outside sports. But it always go down even I tight the strap, especially when I play golf in cold days."
4.0,"a little costly, a nice everyday piece"
4.0,"I love the material, its durable, and slightly water resistant. But I am NOT a fan of the neck strap, and the tie straps. First off they're kinda flimsy, and the neck strap isn't adjustable. I am 5'4 and with the neck strap the top of the apron droops down almost past my breasts!<br />Easy fix though I sewed the neck strap up, added Velcro and now its adjustable!<br /><br />I'm still keeping it cause, I like the material, and it's cheap!"
4.0,"I am very pleased with this. Love the color- a true Red. And it holds a lot of cards, cash etc.."
4.0,"I bought it to hold in place a medical dressing over a skin graft on my scalp. Friends tell me I either look like a French lady or like a flying saucer just landed on my head. The beret is well made, has a nice design woven in, and is not tight on my large head. Unlike all-wool berets, it can be worn in autumn and spring. Although it contains some wool, it does not itch."
4.0,"Great I love these very stylish . Also they came on time. I love wearing them they look great with almost anything I wear,"
4.0,"I read all the reviews with pictures attached before I bought this dress and I was a little concerned about the “chest gap“ that many people brought up. I am 5‘7“ and take a size 10 or 12 in dresses. Large fits me perfectly. I wear push-up bras size 38C And while the fabric in the chest area is slightly strained between two of the buttons, I decided it’s not noticeable. I’m debating whether I should wash the dress or at least just the belt before I wear it, right now the bow is sort of starched which makes it poofier that I’d like, if that makes sense.  It goes down to my knee, no problems there. Totally worth $25!"
4.0,"This dress is red and blue plaid and does have a throwback vintage sort of feel.  The fabric is soft flannel and the fit is as expected.  The fabric is not very thick, however my stepdaughter will wear tights under it and it will be fine.  It looks quite nice and she likes the dress."
4.0,"Beautiful colors, fit perfectly but the balls split easily"
4.0,Like thenleather bracelett lots. Multiple wrapping give impression of layered wrist wear.
4.0,Cute suit for the price. Not the best quality but for the lake it's perfect. Not much support.
4.0,"The product looks nice, bought the for my cartilage piercing. They hurt a bit so I just use them for a different ear piercing location."
4.0,"These glasses were a bit larger than I was expecting--they are both very wide and very tall. This wasn't a problem for me as I was only using them as part of a costume and the borderline comedic effect worked in my favor, but I still found their size surprising. They also feel very light and fragile, but at this price I wouldn't expect much more."
4.0,"Cute little dress. I bought a M and I'm 5'6&#34;, 145lbs and 34DD. I added a slip under it just for modesty with the butty part. Other than that it fit well. If you're taller than me and have a butty this may not work for you."
4.0,Cute dress but rather thin material.
4.0,It is unique and great to wear indoors during winter. The reason I gave it four stars is because it is a tad bit large for my two year old.
4.0,Just got its very nice
4.0,"I like this wallet; it is very well made and I love the color. The only thing I wish it had that I would have given 5 stars for is a pocket on the outside and maybe a few more card slots. Each side has 6, but besides a handful of credit cards, I have several club/rewards/discount cards, insurance, business cards, and it just seems like I could have used a few more slots. Plus, there is no ""special"" place for your driver's license -- so that needs to go into one of the slots too.The metal plate on the back is heavy duty. I wouldn't have minded if that was less substantial because it would have taken a few ounces off the total weight of the wallet. I really bought this for the color and simplistic design. It is a winner in those areas."
4.0,The  product was what I expected.
4.0,They're a little thin and loose but overall I like them!!! I received compliments as soon as I took them out the package.
4.0,these are very tiny for small children's ears will not fit an adult. i purchased these for my 7yr old as a christmas gift they are super small but big enough for her and small enough for it to be harder for her to lose them.. they are beautiful though definitely a item for a small child.
4.0,We think this is so cute!
4.0,"Está bien. Solo que el logo no es como yo esperaba, se mira como pintando y pareciera que puede desgastarse."
4.0,"Looks perfectly nice. Keep in mind is not as skinny as most of this type of ties (it's skinnier than regular ties, but not as skinny as the actual skinny ones)."
4.0,I like it but a little  small I am size 8.5  shoes
4.0,"the waist is a little loose, and the bra is too small if you're actually as curvy as it looks like it's designed for. fits anyway, but not perfect"
4.0,I didn't think I'd like them when I took them out of the bag but I slipped them on anyway and found them really comfortable. Might buy another.
4.0,"Having a hard time getting the clasp to connect to the band. I am in the process of finding someone to help me, maybe even a Jeweler. I did watch the video but they didn't show how to put it back together again."
4.0,"I really liked this belt.  It fit nicely over the clothes or under.  It is thin, so it doesnt stand out that you have it on under your clothes as well. I have a spinal fusion,. so the support it gives me feels great!  Especially since i sit all day, that when i get up, my back is stiff and weak, this helps that feeling.  Not to mention the nice little perk of it helping my pants fit better!!<br /><br />the only downside, which is expected is that when it is on skin, you get very hot with it on.  I recommend wearing a thin tank under it."
4.0,They fit great for the first time but after having them on for a while they get big so I’m constantly pulling them up
4.0,Well put together. It's a XMas gift for my bf so he hasn't gotten it yet but we are both DBZ fanatics so I'm sure he will love it. The colors are perfect a and brilliant. The size may be a bit small but not too bad. May have to size up. Will update after the holidays.
4.0,I get lots of compliments on these boots.  They are comfortable too.  Only complaint is the laces slip and I have to re-tie and tuck them each time I wear them. Wish the laces were elastic and just decorative since the zipper is the functional part.
4.0,"ya its nice,i really like the style but the fabric is not so good."
4.0,"I am 5'10&#34; and typically wear an XL. The XL was too tight in the bust area. I exchanged for the XXL and it was a more comfortable fit. The length was the same for both sizes, all the way to my feet. I am pleased with the purchase."
4.0,Great thick material. Fits nicely. Not see through! Beautiful rich color.
4.0,Love this tons!
4.0,"Very strong, sturdy, and shiney. Very nicely made. My daughter is giving it to her dad for his birthday. I'm sure he will love it."
4.0,"Received several compliments.  Ordered the large based on reviews and it fit like I expected (a nice loose fit). Dress did get larger the longer I had it on.  Since I'm normally a M, it was too big after wearing it a few hours."
4.0,The fabric is a little thinner than I anticipated. I haven't washed it yet. Cute on.
4.0,"Super cute, slightly see through. Got a pair of socks and cute hair ties (I think) with them which is an awesome surprise! Reviews said they ran small so ordered a size up, still a bit small but wearable. The toddler size I bought (2t or 90) was long but right size. Other then that I would’ve rated 5!"
4.0,"I'm 5'3"" / 155 lbs... and based on reviews I ordered the XL slim leg.  Very generous in size.  It fits and is super comfy but I probably could have gone with the L and been fine.  The waist is very loose but my curves hold them up.  A tunic length sweater hides the gap.  Only downside- no pockets."
4.0,"Love this bead. Both my mother and I have gotten so many compliments on them! The only issue I would comment on is that the bead is a bit large around the Pandora bracelet. When not surrounded by other beads, it is very obvious."
4.0,"These stoppers really work on my Pandora bracelet!  They were pretty easy to get on and have a real snug fit.  My only concern is that when I want to put on new beads, I'm nervous to take the stopper off in fear I might break my bracelet.  So I think they will work best as the first charm on the bracelet and have a clip on the other end...I'm a nervous nelly, but they really do the trick!"
4.0,I bought this for my great grandaughter. She is small the jacket was a little large.
4.0,feels good for wearing for a few hours.
4.0,Probably a nice item if you have a very small head. I tried to stretch it out and it fell apart. If your hat size is over 6 3/4 forget it.
4.0,"I live in Guam so I got it in great time! It’s comfortable however, it runs slightly small but it’s not too bad. Also, the wording is not as bright as the picture shows. The wording in the picture looks pink but it arrived looking reddish/brown."
4.0,"This shirt runs a bit large for its labeled size - I'm 6'3&#34; 225 lbs and ordered the XL - and quite frankly, if you're looking for a more fitted look (as I was secretly hoping) then this might not be a good choice for you. As it is, it is loose fitting and comfortable, more in line with what you might find someone wearing at a RenFaire.  I wasn't very crazy about the included leather lace that refused to lose its curl, but getting a shoelace of the same length fixed that issue.  None of these things were a deal killer or cause for me to return, as it indeed a traditional-style kilt shirt that fits like most kilt shirts do."
4.0,I like these pants. They’re comfortable and do look like jeans. If I could change one thing about the fit it would be to make the waist higher. When I bend down it feels like my rear end is showing. Other than that they fit good.
4.0,Nice product.  Longish and does run large.  Haven't washed yet so don't know how will hold up.
4.0,"Pretty and sparkly and looks classy. The clip can be a little hard to undo, though. I had a mild panic thinking I'd never be able to get it out, but it did release eventually. I've also heard that's common with clickers, so don't let it deter you too much."
4.0,"Gave this to my son, who's  big camaro guy, for Christmas. The material seems to be good quality and the fit was as expected. On the one I got, there were some scattered ink droplets from the screening process, but they're only obvious from up close. Otherwise, the image is crisp and looks good. The ad does warn that it will smell like vinegar from the screening process until washed. That's true."
4.0,"It fits well, the face is just a bit larger than I'd expected."
4.0,"Cute casual dress and great for the price! I usually wear a 4/6 but ordered a large and it fits perfectly. Hits me right at the knee and I’m 5’8”. Yes, some threads need to be trimmed and it’d probably shrink if I dried it in the dryer but that’s what expected for the price! So I’ll trim the threads and hand wash/ hang dry."
4.0,"Ordered a 3X (i wear US 12/14) knowing these things always run small, but this runs really small. Didn't return it because it's really pretty, and my daughter wanted it. She wears a US 4/6 or medium and this fits her perfectly  just like the picture."
4.0,"It feels funny to review a $5 item, but maybe this will be helpful to someone.  The black microfiber pouches are just as described, and function well to store eyeglasses.  I purchased two pairs of backup safety glasses for my bike kit (yellow for unexpected rain, overcast or fog; amber for sun), from sunglassesusa.com, and they no longer come with a storage pouch.  I purchased these, and am very happy with them.  They are large enough to hold wraparound safety glasses, and the drawstrings keep the pouch closed.  Perhaps the deserve 5 stars, but it is hard to get that excited over microfiber storage pouches."
4.0,"This dress fits true to size except it’s too long for me.<br />I’m 4’11, 120lbs and I bought a small.  Would be great if you made petite sizes. Great dress for work or dinner."
4.0,"This is a very attractive watch. The size/dial/face was a little smaller than I anticipated but I was not totally disappointed. It had a nice shine to it and would wear well business casual and/or dressed. I have not read the manual yet to set all of the respective sub-times like date, etc. The band is real leather and feels good around my wrist. So, this review centers around visual reality and not yet about performance."
4.0,I love the outfit but I didn't like the fact that the seller didn't inform the buyers of the outfit running smaller than it's original size.
4.0,very attractive piece my wife really liked it I have bought several pieces thru Amazon via Ruby Lane all an oriental motif my wife is Chinese ( Manhattan)  so this style of jewelry is hers .price was reasonable too!
4.0,"I love how it fits. I'm 5'1 and size 4-6 but I ordered a Medium and the length and fit is perfect. The fabric may not be the best material but because of the price, it is good enough."
4.0,Just got my second pair.  I love them.<br />Great quality legging at a great price.
4.0,Worked great as part of a Harry Potter Costume. They include the adjustable tabs and remain pretty free of wrinkles under normal wear.
4.0,"It fits length wise, but it is definitely pretty cheeky. It is also a little revealing on the sides of the suit at the top. There may be the risk for wardrobe malfunction."
4.0,"I wanted to love this dress.  It's so pretty online, and in person, too!  However, I normally wear a size 10, and this dress only came in a size 8, so I gave it a try.  I wasn't sure what to do with the enclosed tassel/tie, but figured it out when I went back to the picture online. I'm 5'3"", and the length comes right above my knees.  Perfect.  The sleeve length is perfect, too, and I don't have long arms.  The problem is that I have a rather large bust ~ between 36DD and 38D, and there isn't much give to the top.  What I did was look at the online picture, and laced the top right at the ""V"", and loosely tied it in a bow at the waist.  The zipper is another problem.  It isn't a high quality zipper, and I'm afraid it will break with several ups and downs.  I solved the problem by gently putting on the dress with the zipper all the way up (it works fine if you are smaller than a 38"" bust).  The dress is very unusual and really attractive. I'm keeping it, and going to wear it on our upcoming cruise."
4.0,"Wish the bow in front was already ruined nicely and permanent, you have to tienitnon your own andnit kind of droops because it’s too heavy. However, my daughter looked beautiful"
4.0,"I bought these for work because I wanted some slim long pants. I am 5’8” and I have very long legs. These pants fit nicely but most of all I like how long they are for the price. Express pants were way too much for me so I bought these and they fit. However, I only bought them in June of 2019 and used them until September of 2019 as I now work from home and don’t need them so i can’t comment too much on if they lasted or not."
4.0,iPhone 6 won't fit.
4.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; with 25&#34; waste and I ordered the small. - Love the look of this and the material and stitching is really sturdy. The latches in front are all fully functional, which means you have 6 latches that can pop open at any time. I would advise gluing three on one side so they are permanently closed, then you'll only have three others to worry about. I was constantly refastening all night because when I move around to dance any little motion will cause the mechanism to unlatch. Still totally worth the money."
4.0,Fun design. Looks good.
4.0,Perfect size & length. Not too heavy.
4.0,"I get compliments on it all the time! Its pretty thin so you'll need a slip. Also, be careful when wearing it to not to tear the seams.. seems like it was made in a rush. I STILL LIKE IT A LOT THOUGH!"
4.0,I love one direction and this was so cool. My friends love it and want to get one too. It shipped from Europe and it did not take to long.
4.0,These are very nice pants with a good fit and they wash well. I prefer a more flared leg but these are OK. I wear them for lounging at home and for doing housework. They stay up very well and they are not too tight in the waistline. The value for the price is great.
4.0,"a bit smaller than I expected but very nice. If you don't have the money to buy diamonds, this is the deal."
4.0,"The boots are really cute, with the band. The fit is tight, and not around the toes, but around the middle of your foot. I bought a half size bigger and they were still kinda tight. It's also gonna take some time getting used to walking in them. They kinda feel like you're rocking when you walk. I'm going to keep them. They seem like good quality boots, and they are really cute."
4.0,Its a very pretty dress but way to small and i went by the size chart.. I gave this to another little girl who is 3 times smaller than my daughter and it fits perfect. Buy up at least one size.. at the least!
4.0,Should've been about $5 cheaper in cost.
4.0,They run big!
4.0,"This dress is causal and soft, maybe fit for long leg ladies but not me.  I will wear it in home because it's comfortble."
4.0,"I saw a similar necklace that I really wanted, but the company was completely sold out.  When I saw this one it came close to the one I wanted, so I ordered it.  The item came beautifully boxed, and perfect for gift giving.  Unfortunately, it just did not live up to my expectations.  A clasp with an extender would make it a little longer, which is what I wanted.  I am giving it 4 stars only because it was not right for me, not because of any defects."
4.0,"I normally wear an 18 in dresses because I have a large chest, so I ordered the XXL. The dress itsel is cute, and when the fabric stretches over my top half, it still remains opaque- a huge plus!<br />However, it is important to note that because my chest takes up a bit of room in the top, the waist fit me higher up like an empire waist. It's still a cute dress and I kept it, but it may be a deal breaker if you ahve a large chest. The rest of the dress fit me perfectly."
4.0,Easy to put on. Keeps water out and see clearly. 👍🏼👍🏼
4.0,Un like the other one of the same look I bought here on amazon this one actually fit the Moto 360 1st Gen. Looks good and feels well built. I'll see how long it lasts as I've heard the paint comes off.
4.0,Very good and durable
4.0,"These sunglasses are very cute. I wanted an extra pair to take on trips because I'm always worried of losing my ray-bans. These have that similar vintage wayfarer style. They come in a little carrying pouch which is nice to keep them from getting scratched.  The colors are really superb,  and I love that they are polarized. The material is a nice thick material,  but the glasses themselves don't seem too terribly sturdy.  Also,  although cute they are quite oversized.  Don't but these if you are looking for a smaller frame. But as the oversized look is in right now I will wear them!  Overall they are a stylish polarized pair of sunglasses that won't break the bank!<br />I had the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,Look smaller than 1/2 kt. Very small but they do bling..
4.0,"good design and material, a bit tight for my head.."
4.0,"I love the neckline!  It adds a lot of interest to this shirt and makes it unique.  It isn't long enough that I would feel comfortable wearing it with leggings, but I still kept it because it is a cute shirt and I can wear it with jeans or capris."
4.0,Fit perfect just the color was alittle off
4.0,A little longer than I liked them to be but good material
4.0,"The colours were absolutely amazing! I got these for a gift and they fit the person just right and were the length they were looking for. The receiver of the socks said that they were comfortable to his tastes. The only downside it that one of the socks got a run on the bottom of the foot after a day of wear, but it was small and could be easily fixed with a needle and thread. The other sock hasn't had any problems, so I think its pair was a bit faulty and not a cause of bad manufacturing. Overall, I would highly recommend these socks if you're looking for thigh-ish high rainbow socks."
4.0,It’s a cute dress but the material is very stretchy-thin so I ended up returning it. It was so tight across the back that it showed every lump and line but I didn’t need a bigger size or it would’ve just been too big. But it gets 4 stars because I think it’s all as advertised and good for the price. Just didn’t work for me.
4.0,These shoes are amazing!!! Comfortable and built well. Look like nikes!
4.0,"Crazy big, and I have a big head! But I love Harley Quinn so I will wear, great quality just big, did I mention It’s big."
4.0,"A great belt for the money. I found it to be a little wide for my shorts, but I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,I expected this to be blousy material.  It was more knit.  Cute but I needed something a little more dressy.
4.0,"This top was super cute and flattering! Perfect for every  day with jeans or a night out. The only issue I have is the front is very low so I wear a tank top. If you are larger chested, it would fit you differently."
4.0,"Great fit, and well made. Very satisfied."
4.0,"These are very comfortable but if your short, I'm 5'4&#34; and had to cut off about 4&#34; and then hem them. If you're willing to do that then you'll love these pants. Fit true to size, soft material and very comfortable."
4.0,"These run a bit small but are quality shoes.  I typically wear a 10 and that's what I ordered; however, the shoe fits very tight against the top of my foot.  I would recommend ordering a size larger."
4.0,"АНГЛИЙСКИЙ<br />beautiful necklace clasp lovely, coral in some places looks old"
4.0,"this hair piece is awesome, i love everything about this chain, thanks amazon and fashiontrend565 for this lovely hair piece"
4.0,"I love the style of this brand, however, the quality isn’t the best. It came with two tiny holes right in the front. I ordered in the summer so indirect wear it for over 30 days. By the time I realized it had holes in it, it was too late to return it."
4.0,"These shoes are extremely comfortable and fit well. However, they look like house shoes. The material would be much nicer in a solid color. I don’t feel right wearing them outside of the house. I paid over $50 for shoes I never wear away from home."
4.0,I'm 5'4&#34; and average build (12/14). Large fits me perfectly. I ordered the mint one and received many compliments. The material is stretchy and breathable.
4.0,"I am extremely top heavy 38ddd and small on bottom size 10ish...average waist...hard to find clothes to fit me without being to tight and uncomfortable on top...does bag a tinsy bit from my top down...but hey it can't be helped for comfort...i never can wear cloth or button shirts. I don't like long maxi dresses..i like this knee length<br /><br />This fits good in top..i may take in waist a bit..or not.. Probably will be ok once I wash it...looks good without being baggy...liked so much I went back and ordered 2 more...<br /><br />For sizing comparison..i am 5'6"" 148...38ddd wear 14plus on top..and can wear size 10 on bottom..but usually get a size 12 bottom to squeeze my chest into a 👗 and use lots of pins.."
4.0,"My sister-in-law suffers from overheating and these cooling scarves are a blessing.  I keep them in the refrigerator so she can change them out.  One of the scarves had very few pellets, so is not useful but the others work great."
4.0,Buckle/clip that hold the side straps are weak and come undone frequently.
4.0,"If you're like me, you stick to less expensive sunglasses because you go through them like toilet paper.  I'm constantly losing them, scratching them, sitting on them, etc.  I'm incredibly accident prone and that, unfortunately, means I'm never going to be someone who can keep a $150+ pair of sunglasses in my purse.  These are perfect for me.  They look great (the red/orange lenses are pretty cool) and the quality is great for the low price you pay.  They are constructed well and if slightly bent, which happens to us all at some point, they are easy to get back into shape without weakening the overall frame.  The hinges are tight, which means they don't get loose on you after awhile.  The size of the lenses is really nice for keeping the sun out of your eyes all the way around.  They are going to be a bit loose if you have a smaller than average head.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend you give these a try."
4.0,"Jost got them. They look and feel great! I would have given 5 stars, but the package they came with had shampoo I ordered in it that got all over the box!"
4.0,kinda loose =( for a thick wrist
4.0,"The colors weren't exactly what we expected but it was still a nice looking and stylish shirt.  Fit as expected.  Good quality, would purchase again."
4.0,Bonito !!!❤️
4.0,daughter loves this dress and it was perfect for her cat party in the summer!
4.0,I hated this dress on me but I gave to my daughter and she loves it
4.0,Nice bracelet. Looks great.
4.0,"Needed something cheap and durable for work. Good wrap-around coverage, just snug fitting. Will probably loosen up a bit after some more wearing."
4.0,"The pants fit great overall. However, they are very long compares to the picture. Great pants, but if you are short (I’m 5’3), they are not going to look like the picture."
4.0,The hat should have more sun protection ot the top of the hat. The sides can remain more open for coolness.
4.0,"These compression socks are very satisfactory.  Light weight to fit in close fitting shoes, whimsically colorful for fun."
4.0,Love the style but sleeves are very tight
4.0,"I'm a 36C and purchased a Large, and it fits well. Neither the band nor the straps cut into my skin. There is very little support, much like a bandeau, but I wasn't expecting much support. The material isn't itchy, and yhe padding is thin enough to not be constricting, but thick enough so that you don't poke through. The back rides up a little, but it doesn't bother me. So far, so good."
4.0,"Cute hat, but it seems to fit big and small at the same time... it's a deep hat but narrow. It's still warm and my baby loves it."
4.0,"4 stars because the color is not the bright red in the picture but more of a dull red, almost brick red.<br />Otherwise the hair scarf works fine"
4.0,Absolutely love this dress! Received it right on time....wanted it before I went on vacation. Colors are beautiful and vibrant and fits just right! Thanks for your awesome service and product!
4.0,"It’s a great dress.<br /><br />I have small critiques: I bought the white one and it’s a little see through. I will need to wear a slip or something under. Also, though it’s suppose to be loose, as a lean but big chested woman it hangs weird off the bust and makes me look boxy or like I’m in a pajama dress. However, I matched it with a belt I have and it looks super cute. Other than that it’s true to size and it’s comfy.<br /><br />Note it is made in China."
4.0,Ilike it but its too large.need to make a return
4.0,If you like Big and Bold. This is the ring for you
4.0,I sooo loved the band and color!!! I returned it because I thought it was the buckle as shown in the picture and not the button fastener. I tried to like it but it’s very hard to put on. I don’t like the button fasteners. If it had the buckle I would of ordered all colors!!!
4.0,"The cut is a classic-vintage style, that provides a  &#34;twist&#34; in today's fashion.  It can be dressed up or down and be fun & fresh for a wide range of ages!<br />I would have given it 5 stars however a portion of the seam along the zipper was not sewn.  I'll have to take it to get fixed and that will cost unnecessary extra $'s. The dress was received wrinkled but was shipped in small package for the amount of (skirt) fabric...so has to be expected.  I like the feel and weight of the fabric....and it fit as expected for a &#34;medium&#34; (8-10) and the measurements as described. I'd definitely buy from this vendor again."
4.0,"The tie on the band keeps unravelling, but the stones are beautiful!"
4.0,"loved the price, it was almost 2 for 1.<br />the only thing I would caution is that the straps, wrinkle/crinkle alot after washing and the water resistency fades a bit...but it's still a good buy."
4.0,"Nice ring, especially for the price. I wouldn't recommend it for your Pinkie finger though. It has a hard time staying on mine because it's too long to fit between my 2 knuckles."
4.0,Great fabric. The zippers are on the cheesy side. The legs aren't as form fitting and my husband works out every day and has good leg muscles.
4.0,"This dress is cute, but runs big. It also wrinkles very easily. I will definitely wear it, but it’s not one of my favorites"
4.0,"This necklace is really just one, long chain that you're supposed to wrap around your neck twice. I didn't realize that prior to buying, but it works just the same. Chain is pretty basic, but looks nice for everyday wear."
4.0,"I bought the 4g size. Since they are quite small, they don't look exactly like the picture. They fit well."
4.0,Nice to Wear around the house. A little thin to be wearing out.
4.0,Buy a size bigger than what you wear. Fits smaller than your normal size. Very comfortable when it fits
4.0,"Cheerful, pretty. Recipient likes it very much"
4.0,if were a little larger just if I compare with the ones I used at hospital!
4.0,"Pretty decent quality for the price. I get a lot of compliments on it. This may be a gift and curse for me, but this purse makes it easy to fit A LOT of stuff inside, due to the many compartments. I removed one star only because I wish all compartments were able to close/zip completely. However, I do recommend this purse."
4.0,"Swimsuit season is upon us and everyone is looking for beach gear and cover ups! First off, when purchasing this item I was unaware that it was &#34;plus size&#34;, as it just said oversized in the product name. I am a very small person therefore may have benefited from a smaller not plus sized coverup. It swallows me whole, as I am 98# and 5'3. However, this isn't such a huge problem because it is a coverup, yet it isn't the most attractive thing on me.<br /><br />The material of the coverup is extremely lightweight and comfortable. It is also fairly well made. This product could fit a variety of body shapes and sizes and is extremely versatile. It will be great to have on my cruise and on any beach trip I go on this year.<br /><br />The only con I have about this item was the smell of it coming out of the clear package. It smelled absolutely rancid. Almost of mildew smell. It was quite strange. I plan to wash it several more times before first use. I'm sure this isn't a common occurance and I sure hope it isn't the materials normal stench. I definitely recommend this product to the thin and curvy. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Looks and feels like high quality silk. Slippery when you knot it.
4.0,"Super cute jeans! Cut is a little tight in the thigh, but other than that- ok!"
4.0,"Good for summer. Fit a little loose, but not too bad.  Nice leather."
4.0,"these are very nice!!  They feel like you are wearing sweats and look like you are wearing jeans.  The tag says to wash them before wearing and the pink cord that you use to cinch these up broke in the wash.  Grrrrr..  I was able to fix them, but that has been problematic."
4.0,The thing is way too long I don't know anybody who has a nostril that thick but it worked just fine and was way more comfortable than the cork screw nose rings.
4.0,"I got this dress within a week of purchasing (standard shipping). I didn't pay attention to material details when I ordered, so I got caught off guard a little bit. It took time to get comfortable in it, personally. Lol I never had spandex material dresses. But it fits well, accordingly to size chart."
4.0,"Nice band. I replace a similar one that wore out on my favorite Kenneth Cole watch.  Looks good, but was a little tricky to figure out the clasp without instructions."
4.0,if it were a little bigger I'd keep it. Other than that it was very nice.
4.0,Loved this bag but too large for what I need. I didn't check the size before buying and hated to send it back. Travelon is a favorite of mine for its organization. This has lots of pockets and all the anti theft security features. Check the size before buying. It's really a beautiful bag.
4.0,"This item was purchased as a present for my daughter, who was thrilled with it!  That item just completes her look.  Thank you for your prompt service."
4.0,"The case is unfortunately not very strong (dropped it once and the phone fell out and a day later a piece of the plastic holster snapped off.)<br />Really cute though, if this one falls apart I'd consider buying another one. Not good for anyone looking for a protective case."
4.0,"I don't like my bra straps to show, the neck hole is a little big, so my straps showed.  I had to put sweater on."
4.0,"Very comfy & perfect for wearing with leggings! A little too big/baggy in the butt-but then again, i have a small butt... 😊"
4.0,"This clutch is awesome! It looks like they are marketing these to men, but I purchased this for myself and love it! It's the perfect size to put all I need to carry with me for a day outing or a weekend trip. Its so roomy and the design is top notch. The leather is soft, but rigid and i'm sure with time will feel lovely and super soft. This actually is much better size than I was picturing in my head and I love it!"
4.0,"I'm 5'6'' 130 pounds wear a 32C bra and have 37'' hips and usually wear a small. I ordered a small and am overall happy with it but it does have some fit issues. First off, it's too large around my upper torso, and vertically too short. When I adjust the straps, the lace on the stomach sits too low and looks funny. So the garment is really tight on my crotch which is uncomfortable. Ordering a medium wouldn't help because then it'd be even bigger around my upper torso. The lace on the waist is also cut and sewn on unevenly, the right side is thicker than the left side. However it was cheap and does look sexy. I'm sure my boyfriend won't notice anything wrong anyway lol"
4.0,"I really like the shirts they are beautiful but definitely order up. thank goodness I got the 3t for my 2 year old and its still small, almost wish I would have gotten the 4t. cute but runs small."
4.0,Nice dress good fit
4.0,"Although the pendant is very small,it is very cute and well made."
4.0,"What can you say about a flip flop.  These are cushy and comfy and are pretty generic.  Yes, I would buy them again."
4.0,"Definitely not maximum control, but suitable for fitness walking, and quite comfortable.  It's a bit noisy/squeaky."
4.0,Fits more like a small
4.0,"It is very beautiful, though the color was not dark red. It is very pretty, but I already have a red one and was looking for the color posted on the picture."
4.0,Comfortable & Cute!
4.0,A little small in the bust. Everywhere else fits as expected.
4.0,"Nice boot, I wear a 10 men's fits perfect, great value for the money"
4.0,This blouse is great! I bought a Medium and the fit is great. I am 125 pounds.
4.0,Go larger if you have thicker thighs!
4.0,Love the look of this band. Will see it’s durability in time. Should have been a loop band for better security. Attaches by magnetic claps on the end. Overall I’m pleased with the look.
4.0,"I really like the design,  not the normal round bib!  Adds to the baby's outfit!  Definitely thick enough for babies that drool alot.  I love that it has snaps, not velcro."
4.0,This is a nice dress for the price. Very flattering.  It is true to size and a great length.  The only issue is the color is not exactly as pictured.
4.0,Great for back to school shopping for teens or adults.  Nice and good quality denim.  Fit as desired.
4.0,"A bit smaller than I expected, but I love the shinny look (you know they are plastic, but I'm OK with that).<br />I usually only tolerate silver or gold, and after a couple of months of frequent use, still doing fine with my ears.<br />Considering buying them in more colors."
4.0,"Me encantó pero tengo una muñeca muy pequeña y el tamaño de la correa es demasiado largo, tuve que cortarlo con tijeras para poderlo usar.<br />Ojalá los hicieran por talla pues me gustó mucho la calidad."
4.0,These are very long. Perfect for me. I’m 5’10. The color is a bit different. They are like an apricot pink color. Not beige.
4.0,This is my second pair. Good glasses for everyday wear.
4.0,Only get the one with the clasp..not a magnet. The first one tore at the magnet..but this one is awesome.
4.0,"I use this almost every day. I don't care for a headlamp light and don't want to carry a flashlight, so this works great. I did have an issue with the first one, but the seller replaced it and it's been working great. Kudos on the customer service. The light is powerful enough to see far enough into the distance. I've encountered skunks and snakes on my path and was able to avoid. For that, I'd give it 10 stars. The belt does slide a bit over a few days, but not enough to be a huge issue. A few stitches remedy the issue permanently."
4.0,"Great quality for the price. I normally wear size medium to large in this type shirt but I ordered the XXL and it fit good. The shoulder and pecs and arm openings are snug enough to show off my gym work!  The body of the shirt was just right not to tight, draped fine. The fabric is very soft and comfy. I bought the blue and it look great!"
4.0,I do like the dress except it is a  bit smaller in size and I think it would be much better if it were made of cotton and not nylon.
4.0,Bonnets fit great and aren’t too hot because it’s a breathable mesh. I will definitely order another set once I can trust post office to actually deliver my orders. I have several stuck in purgatory.
4.0,"Oh my gosh, I have so many earring to choose from now..these are very nice and inexpensive earrings. You have many choices to choose from. There are some I couldn't possibly wear ,because they are larger, then I expected some are to heavy for my ears..I'm happy with the choice I made. Thank you"
4.0,Soft and secure enough to keep out most light ( a tiny bit gets in around the nose). Head strap is soft and could fit a decent range.
4.0,I like the color because it is bright. You can find quickly when you put it down. This works well with my camera and holds the extra battery and sim cards as well.
4.0,"This was a gift for my sister and she loved it, it was perfect!"
4.0,I’m 5”4 and weight 200 even . I bought a size XL due to having 38DDD boobs. The jacket fits a little snug and the pants are perfect and stretchy . This outfit is definitely for the curvy girls . We bought again …
4.0,awesome! except I wish the post was in the center
4.0,So far the product works well. Follow instructions carefully.
4.0,Sizing runs a little large. Decent weight to the material<br />Can be worn casually or accessorized
4.0,Fit is good for exercise and for sleeping gear.
4.0,"The mask lights up as described, worked just fine for my 11yr old Son on Halloween, no major complaints, the noise is a bit piercing and can get to you after awhile, especially if you are sensitive to such things, but for the price, it did it's job and just as good as more expensive ones!"
4.0,"I am with purchase, but the earrings are very small the size in the picture is deceptive, but overall they don't bother my ears."
4.0,"They are amazing and look very good, they are confy..."
4.0,"Very comfortable.  The only downside would be, there are no slits to remove the pads or even straighten them out as they were folded when I received them."
4.0,"The bottom fit perfectly, but the top had some space, but my upper body is smaller than my lower body"
4.0,"Since no one uploaded any pictures, I figured I should to help out my fellow sisters.😉<br />So I'm very curvy, the dress has a tight fit at my hip, unlike the model. (I'm 5""5 and 155lbs.) Rather than that, no it's not ""comfortable"" it's literally all metal, lol, it does have a coating on the inside so that's nice. It's not easy to get on and off either. I've tried it on a couple times and a rhinestone has fallen off, creating a hole, so I need to hook it back together. It is what it is. This dress is just for a night out. Nothing more. I'm wearing it as a costume, so I'll update my photos!"
4.0,The strings are I dangling but I cut off with scissors hopefully that does the trick.
4.0,"My mom loved it, but the bracelet was a little small. It was hard to get it on and off her wrist. It would be perfect if it was a little bigger. My mom is not an overweight person...she is 5'8"" and wears size large clothes."
4.0,Good to play outside
4.0,Super cute good price
4.0,The gloves arrived too late for my trip. I kept them but have not used them. I like how they felt upon my return.
4.0,This dress was perfect for our maternity pics!!!! I am 5’2 and and very pregnant. The length was perfect so my feet didn’t show which i liked. Arm lace was a bit big but if I would have done a medium instead of a large the waste under the bust wouldn’t have fit (everything is pretty stretchy except the bust line). Since the price was reasonable we ended up cutting a line up the font for the tripod belly exposure which was beautiful and modest to my liking!!
4.0,Very nice .....nice material.....
4.0,This top is so cute!! I was so disappointed when it did not fit. I am 105 pounds and 5’7 and it was very baggy. I wish they had an extra small.
4.0,It's a nice looking
4.0,"The waistline for a medium skirt is 28 inches. That’s rather small. It has a rubber band however rather tight so I recommend you order a medium if you have a small waist.<br /><br />Other than that, good quality in my opinion. I don’t know why other reviewers talk about a hemline, the skirt flows nicely, and the hemline with it. Good buy for the quality but mind the waistline."
4.0,"Great billfold, well made, plenty of space for credit & ID cards, has two sections/compartments for currency.  I like the picture & message on the front."
4.0,"Runs small, gave it to my 17 yr old kid instead"
4.0,"It was a tad shorter than I had hoped, as I am 6' but it's comfortable, the color is pretty spot on as well."
4.0,it was too large
4.0,A nice sweatshirt for a reasonable price.
4.0,looks very nice but be careful it can break easily the ring is not extremly comfortable but is so because it is cheap metal and its and adjustable size ring.
4.0,Nice necklace.  My third time buying... Fades quickly so I purchased a few.
4.0,"Liked the hook closure design at the back. Fits well under the bust, around the torso."
4.0,I didn't like them BTW for the price I guess what do you expect
4.0,I loved the stretch in the skirt but it ran a little on the large size
4.0,Very nice but did not last!
4.0,"A little more sheer than I had expected, but I purchased the white and blue dress. It is very flattering and cute otherwise! Not so long that I trip on it, but not too short either. It falls a little below my ankle."
4.0,"Material was nice, but the fit was a little smaller than expected. One of the shirts that was given as a gift was a little too tight on. Great buy otherwise!"
4.0,The slipper is supposed to relieve foot discomfort. Not quite as advertised. Also had to return 1st order because  it was smaller on my foot than sizes I use in purchasing at retail stores
4.0,"Very comfortable. A little bit higher above the knee than I thought it would be, but super comfy and nice and thin for those hotter days of summer."
4.0,I wore them to prom & they were so beautiful! Just slid down my arms a lot...
4.0,It's a substanial piece of jewelry...very attractive.
4.0,Love this overalls! Really cute! The only thing about it is that it's way too baggy---I had it adjusted and now it fits just fine with my petite frame!!!
4.0,"nice, but much smaller than I thought."
4.0,"Nice shoe, but order a half size smaller than you normally wear. These run larger"
4.0,Such a cheep watch. But it's water proof and I wear it all the time
4.0,Got all 6 of them and I love them but didn't get the red one . And it took awhile to receive.
4.0,"Came quicker than expected. Good quality. Great gift. Though in the picture there is a medal chain, which is misleading, because it does not come with any."
4.0,"This is definitely oversized! As recommended by most reviewers, I ordered a size down from my usual. I often order a size L so I don't have anything tight to constricting on, but a Medium is huge on me. I think I would have preferred a size Small instead. Fun to wear, love the pockets. It's fairly soft, definitely warm and toasty. I turned mine inside out and washed in the machine on delicate and dried on low/delicate cycle, came out great, no pilling."
4.0,"The bra is very alluring, but it was too big."
4.0,"The fabric was not was we were expecting.<br />A bit cheap and dull, but the dress is cute.<br />I won't add give a 5 star, but I also won't give it less than 4 stars.<br />Get a 1 size bigger"
4.0,"I purchased an XL and I am usually a M/L. The XL fit me perfectly. The material of the shirt is cotton however the graphic material is more silky and seems like it may have been ironed on. The graphics leaves imprints if the shirt is folded for too long as well from the lines of the foldings. However this shirt is super cute, totally love it!"
4.0,Beautiful love it thanks
4.0,Great teacher gifts. They are as described. They came in a cute little bag. Only wish they each came in their own little bag.
4.0,Great watch for wearing at work because I am constantly getting it wet and it still works
4.0,Love this bag. I just wish the teeth on the zipper were not so sharp. I cought my nail in it several times. Otherwise a top choise and a high quality materials.
4.0,"These have been wonderful to wear under dresses and skirts!  They're nice and soft; the waistband is covered with fabric instead of having the skin-irritating exposed elastic, which I love, adding to comfort.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because the pretty lace unravels easily."
4.0,It is really nice. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the inside is cramped.
4.0,rating 4.5<br />Good quality socks that provide the compression I need. I’ve tried many similar products but these definitely are best bang for buck.<br />I would like to find same basic sock at calf length.
4.0,I like them but I haven't worn them yet.
4.0,I really like the strap but took a month to get to me.
4.0,One of my Chokers broke easily.... But the other chokers I love them I wear them almost everyday!
4.0,Good gloves for the price.  If you want better made gloves you would have to pay more.  They are good for every day rides.  They have adequate padding and do have many cooling features.
4.0,"They look very nice and shiny & fit very well (size 7). However, I got two heart stones instead of an oval shaped stone so I'm in the process of returning/replacing them."
4.0,"Everything came as described. The granddaughter loved it. The only complaint is the headdress had a terribly strong smell, im guessing from the material that it is made from. A day out of the package outside helped though."
4.0,"I’m 5’8”, 145 lbs. and the Medium fit great. The dress was a couple inches short in the front when wearing 3” heels, so my shoes show a little. The back is fine because it has a small train.<br />There were a few snags in the lace, but other than that I’m happy with it. It’s very comfortable and stretchy. You will need to wear a stick on bra, there isn’t any support and the material is pretty thin. I’ll probably wear some shapewear too because it is form fitting."
4.0,Cute but cheap. As expected for the price.
4.0,Watch is fine.  But they sent me instructions for analog watch not digital.
4.0,"Love this dress, I get lots of compliments. I personally think the waistline sits in an odd place (not the natural waist but below the bust line), but no one has said anything to me."
4.0,Today is gonna be the day I recommend to you I know by now you had this coming soon I don’t believe anybody was as excited as I do.
4.0,"Looks just like the picture, but is larger than I expected; both the ornaments, and the chain. Very good value for the money for sure."
4.0,"I have 8 piercings in each ear and have every hole filled with these! I LOVE how they look. They are the perfect size, are nice colors and I love the sparkles. My only complaint is I keep losing the pretty sparkly ball of them. I have only had them about a month and started out with 4 extra. I have had at least 8 fall off at random times/places, sometimes I find them and sometimes I don't. I tighten them every few days and they still fall off. Today I lost 3 and am now 2 short, which means, I have already lost 6 that have not been found in the short time I've had them. I will order more because of how nice they look and just keep replacing them. They are not expensive and even with falling off are still worth the price!"
4.0,It came with a hole on the seam. It's a missed stitch about the size of a quarter... Loved it otherwise.
4.0,"This tie clip came on time, which was a relief because it was a gift. It has a nice texture and doesn't feel too light. It's shorter than one might want, however. Make sure to read the sizing of the tie clip before ordering."
4.0,Very cute watch!
4.0,I'm very pleased with this product. It fits in a backpack which is extremely convenient when travelling.
4.0,"very nice even though it's kind of large, but I just put a belt on"
4.0,Love this the size just runs small
4.0,Nice shoes but they run very big. My son is an 8.5 in sneakers and the 8 in these shoes were very big on him.
4.0,I like it but overall it breaks fast. Not too strong because it doesn’t fit on my hands. I gotta open it up a little to get it in my arms. Couple of times doing it it snap on me. I recommend this for people who hand aren’t big.
4.0,"Happy with the product - the fit is good, and the &#34;fabric&#34; nice and soft."
4.0,"I love this jumpsuit! I wear it all the time. Unfortunately, it is difficult to get on and off.  The keyhole that opens the neckline to step through is not big enough and the neckline has popped a few stitches coming on and off. Also, the button loop is too small for the button and is difficult to fasten."
4.0,I ordered a small size and it feels like medium. But it's really comfy and pretty.
4.0,I like them but I wonder if I look stupid in them.  I think they're really cute.  I'm really thin and think they are adorable but the crotch is really low and I'm tall and have a hard time going up stairs.
4.0,"It's a little tight, but other than that, it's great."
4.0,This is the L and it fits my husband who is 6 feet tall and weighs less than 175. I washed and dried this in machines but didn't iron it. The sleeves can be rolled up and held in place with tabs. Smallish pocket with an extra touch of style with a contrasting black edge. Inside the collar is nicely lined and complemented with a red striped fabric. Medium to lightweight 100% cotton fabric -- great materials and construction!
4.0,"It was very nice,  for well, my daughter was very pleased"
4.0,Nice dress but it was thinking material and see through but that may of just been the white colored fabric
4.0,"Nice clean cut, the caramel is pretty rich in its tone and the buttons are shiny but not in an overly flashy way. The only deficiency is that the material is a little thin and doesn't feel as smooth and luxuriant to the touch as good corduroy does. However, definitely seems worth the price. I'll have to see if it holds up well after washing."
4.0,"Very comfortable, but sizing is a bit small. I found out too late after seeing them on my son after washing all of them and he had already worn a few pair. They'll work for now, but I will be buying more of these in a bigger size for him."
4.0,"Nice o wear it all the time, nothing special but it looks great"
4.0,Very pretty.  I get lots of comiments.  I will mention that it looks 'mass produced' because it is but I took off a star for that.
4.0,Super cute. Bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday she looked adorable. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it broke on the pants fast cause it's a really thin and light material but my daughter was in a bounce house jumping and going bananas. Overall I still recommend this product ;)
4.0,top is actually too big for me but for price will have altered
4.0,"The color is much different than shown in the picture. The ""wine"" one is like blood red or crimson. It's shape is very boxy. It's too wide and short to be very flattering on some body types. But the material is as expected and it is sewn well."
4.0,"Was ok. Not the best material or quality for the price. Should have been less than $10 for the set. The shirt is a little too short as well, but hey, it's for sleeping in. Would I buy again? No!"
4.0,"It's bigger than I thought! Definitely an attention grabbing ring. It is a little loose, but my hands are also kind cold right now. Takes a while to come from India, but it was still earlier than estimated. I'll admit the metal setting is not as finished looking as I expected, but the beauty of the rough stone makes up for it."
4.0,"The costume is very pretty and of good quality, but my 7 year old complained of the hem/seam (pictured) on the straps feeling uncomfortable and was asking if I could cut it  so that it is smooth and I said that would leave a hole."
4.0,This set of jewelry was very pretty. I gave it to my brother for Christmas he loved it. It has not changed color. I would recommend.
4.0,The product was pretty when I received it and after wearing it for about a month it was tarnished and absolutely unwearable due to its looks and I had to throw them away. So don’t even waste your couple of dollars on this product… Very inferior product!
4.0,It’s nice to have something different and it’s very pretty. With larger wrists it’s really tight.
4.0,Cute little top fits just like pictures
4.0,Fine for small collection
4.0,A little long in the foot area.  Will try washing and see if it helps.  Also warmer than I expected.
4.0,"Got these for my 7 year old to try. She likes them, so that is great. They look cute on her, the sides are extremely flexible so I feel that they will fit a range of different sizes of people, and it makes them seem more durable. The tint is not super dark, I personally prefer my sunglasses a bit darker, but that is the only drawback for me!"
4.0,"They are ok, just short lengthwise. My daughter is about 5'7 and they were too short. My son tried them on and he is 5'4 and they fit perfect."
4.0,Good. i gave as a gift
4.0,Bought these for my bridesmaids to go with their navy dresses. This set is lovely and classy.
4.0,"True fit to the size, feel nice when you wear it, looks stylish.<br />Overall really nice jacket...."
4.0,"You'd never expect a sight-unseen tuxedo to fit so beautifully, but it does. I am not a really big guy and (after going on a non-fat, heart healthy diet) lost 15 pounds. Now a size 38, with a 30-inch waist. This ""slim fit"" Calvin Klein tux was exactly the right cut for me. It required only three alterations: shorten sleeves, take in the waist slightly and hem the pants. That's it. There were a couple of minor issues. The tux was meant to rest on a hangar in its shipping carton, but this hangar came lose during shipping and the tux was crumpled on the floor of the box. So, it was fairly rumpled. The lapels also suffered, maybe from the same shipping issue. My tailor has assured me this will be repaired with careful steaming. All in all, a great buy."
4.0,This shoe was very narrow.  I even go a 1/2 size larger.  Beautiful shoe though.
4.0,"My club colors have to be blue. I wanted dark blue to show my patch off. I also ordered a black for the patch from an organization I'm in. When they came, I couldn't tell the difference except for the tag on the bag! So I had to send it back for wrong color. Liked everything else about it. Kept the black, washed well and kept fit."
4.0,Got it for my husband. Runs smaller but it has stretched alittle bit.
4.0,"A nice size pendant at about 1.3"" vertically and horizontally as well as .110"" thick.  No sharp edges or burrs can be seen or felt on mine but the surface finish of the front and back are not perfect.  There are visible creases or indentations in the surface finish on both flat sides under close inspection.  They seem to be most noticeable adjacent to the two spots where the male symbol attaches to the heart.<br /><br />Mine came with both a wire choker and a black hanger cord included.  The hanger on the pendant is large enough to accept up to about a 4.5mm diameter round chain."
4.0,"Happy with these earrings, they look great, and don't bother my sensitive ears.  Are a tad big though."
4.0,"I looked absolutely adorable 😍 and sooo many compliments...I rocked it with gold & black simple statement accessories, sheer black stockings that popped the calves, black fancy cut...simple 6inch leather booties. The dress said it all!!!"
4.0,Love them !! I can always find my chapstick easily now .
4.0,"I bought it to use in case I need one.  I haven’t used it yet, but it seems sturdy."
4.0,"This material is thinner than my more expensive sheath dresses, so I needed to size up so that it didn’t show so much of my little ripples in my skin.  I’m a solid size 6, and the medium works perfectly!  True to color and is great for the price!"
4.0,"Dress is gorgeous and seems really well made but I'm 5'2&#34; and around 130lbs with a 29D bra size...and the small is not small enough.<br />I love it so I'm going to try to get it taken in, just wish it came in an xsmall. (I normally wear a small)"
4.0,It's a good value for money. The accessories are adorable and it fits true to size. The one thing I wasnt aware about is the tassels are only in the front and not the back too. Just be aware if that.
4.0,gets dirty easily but still looks super cool!
4.0,These fit ok. I normally wear a size 9.5 and the 9 fit. I returned them because they were too high for me. They also are rounded on the bottom so they tend to rock a bit when walking in them.
4.0,Does the job... 3rd pair we have purchased
4.0,Fits well but it is more like jersey material than the dri fit I was expecting.
4.0,"I have not worn this belt yet but do like how it looks, seems to run really small"
4.0,"This tank is super cute and worth the hype. It is a compression like material, so it holds everything in. I love to wear this as is or as an under shirt. I am 5’7”, 155lbs, have an athletic build, and ordered a large. Only complaint I have is that I wish it was a bit longer, but I can work with this. Have it a 4/5 because of the length"
4.0,Earrings were very heavy but necklace was great!
4.0,"I couldn't really tell from the picture, but this adult bib has a white background. I hope that doesn't proove to be a problem when it comes to stains.<br />Snaps secure the bib around the neck. There is only one choice of snaps to use, so it is not adjustable at the neck. A pair of snaps form a pocket at the lower end of the bib, handy to catch crumbs of food or whole bites that might get dropped.<br />I recommend this adult bib for caregivers of adults who are unable to feed themselves, or those who can but may not have the motor control to do it perfectly."
4.0,I tried it for my son and didn't like that nose portion keeps going down. I will need to make arrangement with elastic in order to maintain in place. Never really used it.
4.0,"Great quality bows. Grosgrain bow on an elastic headband. Colors as photographed (true to color), and very vibrant. The product, the bow headbands, arrived as expected and I can not wait to see them on my baby niece. The only thing I have to say that is bad is the hot pink headband was a little stained, but other than that, wonderfully made."
4.0,"I like this watch, thank you guys"
4.0,"I am a nurse and bought this watch to hang on my lanyard.  I figured this would be easier when in patient's rooms, rather than using a wrist watch.  It is nice, but a little on the heavy side.  Actually went back to using my wrist watch."
4.0,Beatifull dress Classic!
4.0,"Overall it isn't a horrible hoodie. However, i was under the impression that the hoodie would be just like most, but the material was shiny, more polyester I believe. It didn't feel too breathable, (I think it would get hot quickly wearing it.) and the image seems like an iron on. I believe the image will be damaged in the wash pretty quick. I was a bit disappointed about that. This was for a gift so I don't know how it has held up. In the end I was happy cause my niece was happy."
4.0,I’m 5’6 130lbs and ordered a 6/medium.<br />The dress fits nicely. The material is a little heavy.
4.0,"Bigger than I expected, but so far holding up great. Room for plenty of cards, was able to jam 2 of those big thick RFID cards in there, too. I dig the two large compartments, nice for keeping receipts separate from cash. Much prefer this to the Alchemy Goods recycled bike tire wallet I was using previously; although I preferred the relatively small profile of the AG wallet, the rubber made it kind of hard to get in / out of my pocket, and it DESTROYED all my cards (they would get black rubber residue on them and the magnetic strips would wear off, no such problems with this cork wallet). It does *not* look like leather, but is very classy looking."
4.0,Love the hat anyways but The flag is a little crooked :/
4.0,Lovely dress...fits beautifully
4.0,Soft but lost it’s shape after 1 washing
4.0,"This cross body purse is well made, and I could smell the leather as soon as I opened the package. It has a lot of pockets. Inside the main pocket there are two smaller pockets on each side, one with a zipper and one without. There is a pocket on the front with a magnetic closure, and two pockets with zippers, one of which is like a built in wallet.<br /><br />I also like that the cross body strap is adjustable, and it is also leather.<br /><br />I wish the built in wallet had more than two card holder partitions, also the zipper pull on one of the outside pockets keeps falling off."
4.0,I got this for my aunt ..she loves it ..and looks great in it as well 👍
4.0,They are a 10 and I wear and 8 and there a bit tight on the top of arch
4.0,Very nice but a little large
4.0,"Very nice deep red with black accents, just as pictured.  Just the right size and not heavy at all.<br />Very nice ear wires also."
4.0,Nice shirts and comfortable. Fabric is soft but a bit too much see through. You can wear them under something else but not just by themselves- especially the white one. Ordered black and white.
4.0,Can't believe how cute and well made this suit is for the price. Waist is very high if you have a long torso but it still covers everything I want it to. I love the bottoms.
4.0,"I live in a region with mild/moderate winters now. This is a cute ""autumn"" boot. Comfortable, thick enough to block wind and maintain a degree of warmth, but thin enough it wouldn't be ideal for very cold weather if you'll be outside any length of time.<br />I normally wear a wide shoe, but found these work fine if I go up a size. I put additional insoles in for added comfort and cushion."
4.0,"I'm glad I ordered an XXL. I typically wear a 36D, and read reviews saying to order bigger sizes.  Glad I did. Very comfortable and love the front zip. I don't like the pull over styles."
4.0,"Fits as expected, just the right type of loose fit as for the model, stripes fall at times, it would have been better if they were adjustable"
4.0,"Other than having a cheap, flimsy zipper, it's a very  nice coat, especially for the price. Just don't know why they skimped on the zipper. I would still recommend."
4.0,"Super cute! It is not form fitting, so you could order smaller IF you really care about that. Otherwise, great dress for the price!"
4.0,"The pants look and fit great.  I'm 5'10"", around 153 pounds.  They are really cute.  However, before I even put them on, I noticed a seam was loose.  So I flipped them inside out and saw there were several dangling threads - an indication that the manufacturing is definitely not the greatest.  I sew, so it wasn't an issue to secure the seam.  Also, the price is great.  So, a star was subtracted for craft.  If that wasn't an issue, they would definitely get five stars."
4.0,The lava rock holds the oil well. The chain looks much cheaper in person than it appears in the picture.
4.0,Sexy and fit nicely
4.0,"I absolutely love the style and the simplicity of the watch. I’m giving it 4 stars because of how annoyed I got with the latch. After that, I loved it. It’s a pain to get it right but worth it I guess"
4.0,Great light weight jacket! It's thin and perfect for spring/summer. I'm 5'1 and it's a bit long on me but I still like it bc its a baggy-er look!
4.0,Very neat product! It arrived much sooner than expected and was a nice surprise. You get what you pay for.
4.0,"The sizes are way too small. Almost about one and a half size smaller than expected. Yet when u go up a size, the shoe still fits oddly."
4.0,"Very nice quality, but,smaller than expected.  Will wear it with leggings."
4.0,Muy buenas e igual a la descripción. El empaque llega en bolsa.
4.0,"Basically, I like the dress, I love dresses with pockets, I don't like to carry a bag if I don't have to. It has room for my I.D., keys, money, cell phone, and credit cards. The card pocket on the back of the dress is awkward to reach, and the material is just okay. It is not lined, so it tends to cling if you do not wear a slip, and I usually don't.  I've worn it as a casual dress and also dressed to up a little by adding a necklace or a pin.  Works well as a travel dress."
4.0,"Lightweight, great for a quick trip out/to the beach. If you dont like the tag it comes off easily and doesnt leave a mark"
4.0,this is the second pair I have purchases and I will be getting another pair for backup
4.0,"Love this, so cute, exactly as pictured. Perfect for layering. Considering buying other colors! 5’4” 125lbs, small was perfectly oversized."
4.0,"A bit above the knee, so not my style."
4.0,Using this for pool aerobics. Great fabric.  Should hold up well.
4.0,"The quality is much better than I anticipated. I with there was more silver in this particular set, but the gold is ok too, I just tend to wear more silver. It has a great variety of different styles and sizes of the rings. There are lots of cute necklaces of all different style types, too. For the price and the quality, you really can't go wrong. This would absolutely make a great gift!"
4.0,something pretty without all the cost and worry of losing them. I think that I made a very good buy.
4.0,I ordered the gray version of this shirt.  It is actually a little blue.  Maybe I misread the description but I did not anticipate the blue tint.  However I was looking for something causal that wasn't a plain t-shirt and this item does exactly that.  It has spandex in to keep it's shape and is has a flowing feel to it but it is a fairly thick material.  It feels sturdy but it also such a unique print it feels really fun.  The mix of prints is unexpected but creative.  The multiple colors make it easy to match with a cardigan if needed.
4.0,Now I can finally do a terry cosplay
4.0,"The material is great for summers, the design is nice but blue in the dress is nothing like picture. That being the main reason I bought this I am disappointed in the product."
4.0,It is classy and delicate and elegant. You may think it suitable only for parties but you could use it as casual wear too. Its very unique in style; I haven't seen one like this in the stores. You should grab it.
4.0,I really liked it I tried it on and feels comfortable
4.0,"I purchased these for my wife and while they are comfortable they do tend to slip off, since I don't wear them I think the heel part of the slipper should be a little higher."
4.0,The tam is warm and comfortable
4.0,Fits big. Beautiful ring
4.0,Arrived with 1/2&#34; hold along the seam.  What do you expect for $6.00?  Fixed and moved on.  Happy with hat
4.0,It shuffles the cards well but does always end up with cards on the side in the bottom.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c44d9e0d229a2f672050aa350bd374df]] I really love this sweatshirt, the pocket is a little unexpectedly odd however since it opens from on top instead of the sides. See video to explain.<br />Otherwise, it looks great and is comfortable and fits well!"
4.0,"I’m waiting for these to fall apart but in the mean time, I love them"
4.0,I've already bought 3 gis they fit the kids great.  However it seems as if they changed their sizing.  The last gi did not fit my son at all.  It was huge.  For reference he is 6 ( 45 lbs) and I ordered the coo.
4.0,"It is pretty high across the back but still very sexy, fits and wears great."
4.0,"Prettty in Pink, OH so Sweet"
4.0,Nothing surprising here.  This Titanium necklace is just that:  Titanium.  I like that it's uber light and will last forever :)
4.0,Nice & soft. Stretchy. Had to take the thick pads (removable) out - too bulky for my taste. Nice coverage
4.0,"These are a bit small for an adult, but they were perfect for my class of preschoolers singing Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. :) They aren't very durable or the best quality, but for a temporary use they are just fine. Be aware they do come all squished and malformed in a tight little box, so they won't be perfect spheres. They did regain most of the intended shape with a few days in a loose container, though."
4.0,I like it but little see through as material is really thin.
4.0,I bought this Shirt for my Sister and she loves it though we both agree that the shape is a bit awkward in Toki Doki female shirts. Between the two of us we have three and I'd say they look better on her since she has such a tiny frame. The print is very bright and does not wear out easily. The quality is nice. I'd recommend.
4.0,"I like it very much, as I love butterflies and this goes so very well with my bedroom's décor. However, it is meant for my jewelry and as lovely as it is, I can't love this product simply because the practicality of it is less than what I really need. I can hang a few necklaces on it, but there really is not an abundant number of places to hang these things without them tangling. So pretty object, but the functionality of it is more meh."
4.0,"Was actually better than expected. Very durable canvas, nice liner. Had issue with zipper when arrived. My husband was able to fix. I would recommend but, suggest look at main zipper when it arrives."
4.0,"The boots are adorable and have a great &#34;grippy&#34; bottom so my LO doesn't slide around. However, if your babe has chunky legs, this is not the boot. The velcro does not stay closed on these boots and causes distress with my daughter."
4.0,Slightly deceptive where you think you are getting two rings but you are only getting one other than that they are wonderful drinks excellent quality fit perfectly I am very pleased with this product the rhinestones do not fall out and believe me having five children I can assure you of that
4.0,was good but maker of the jersey has the cut a little too big. not the sellers fault though
4.0,My wife is super happy with her gift. Fits true and really warm (so she says).  Construction appeared to be good quality but time will tell.
4.0,I bought it as a gift for my cousin sister . it was very beautiful . earings are big enough and noticeable.<br />my sister loved it.<br />i wish packaging was little better . the packaging looked little cheap .
4.0,"live in Arizona so these fit the bill.  I know from past experience that umbrellas, canopies will only last 2 years here if left out and then sun rot unless the material is sunbrella.  So not worried about fading (ordered 2 tan).  Quality is good and value excellent."
4.0,"Good watch, a little bigger then I expected"
4.0,Was unsure of what size to order because of the difference in U.S. sizes compared to other countries sizes
4.0,"I have a 28&#34; waist. I think it will fit up to a 32&#34; waist because of the elastic, but no more. My husband thinks the print looks like it is photocopied. It is not like the picture up close. The print is pixelated. The skirt is lined with a half slip. I probably will cut this out. The fabric is nice and the fit it good for me."
4.0,"If you're looking for a lightweight jacket to add a bit of camo flair to your outfit, this one will serve you well. The fabric is a bit stiff, but it's sturdy, so should hold up to years of use. The seams are stitched well and solidly, so you're not likely to have any issues with the jacket falling apart on you. It's lightweight, so good for a cool Fall or Spring evening, but you'll need something warmer under it if it's much below 45 degrees outside (if that's not too low a temp for your taste already). The jacket fits well, and as far as length go, the sleeves do seem a bit long to me, but it's easy enough to fold the cuffs back to shorten them a bit.<br /><br />Overall, well made, and a good choice if this is your style."
4.0,Yes the collar was a little large but I still think it’s totally worth it. It’s very sturdy and a good value
4.0,"Dress is beautiful but more for a younger person. I'm 55 years old, didn't look good on me. Will return."
4.0,I like the material and the color. Good quality. No need to spend more money for Nike or something else. highly recommended
4.0,"these feel great.  I only wish there were different sizes especially for petites because I'm short and these bunch up a lot.<br /><br />I don't know about durability as I haven't had them long enough.  I washed once (delicates) and so far so good.  Besides, for the price I don't expect them to last forever.<br /><br />Good purchase."
4.0,It was very puffy - more so than the picture showed. It was a little smaller than I expected. It will not work out for my office Holiday party and has been sent back.
4.0,DRESS WAS ADORABLE BUT TOO SMALL FOR ME  USED THE SIZE CHART BUT I RECOMMEND ONE SIZE UP
4.0,"The color and quality of the jeans were perfect. The size, I felt, ran big. I was still able to wear them, but they were a little loose. I imagine once I wash and dry them they might shrink a little bit, so I’m not concerned. Overall a great buy."
4.0,Arms were a little too tight but otherwise fit as expected
4.0,Bought the 7 inch size without bothering to measure my wrist.  My mistake.  Bracelets were too small for me and they cannot be stretched.  Otherwise seem to be a good product.
4.0,It is warm but the fit is too small.
4.0,This was a gift.  The recipient loved it.  The pendant is quite cute and met description.
4.0,"I bought this as an accessory for a costume and was so impressed by the quality that I wear it all the time. Pendant is engraved with words but cross is plain (despite the photo shown depicting Jesus on cross, that isn’t the same product that I received). Very nice!"
4.0,Good Fit and comfortable!
4.0,I am a 38D and the XL is a great fit even after the first wash
4.0,Very cute and summery
4.0,"Shoes were for my son,who really liked them. Had to return them for a bigger size and different color. Waiting on my new pair. should be coming tomorrow."
4.0,"For me is very good, I recommended"
4.0,These sets are everything I expreat Deal on ected and more! The stones actually do look like Emeralds - at least to one not overly familiar with real stones. The silvertone metal looks like real silver and for the price I paid - who cares if it doesn't maintain its luster -  I can replace all of the fittings from pieces purchased through Amazon!!!
4.0,This is a cute casual top but be aware that it runs large. I ordered a size large and it fits like an extra large. It’s okay if you like really loose fitting tops. It’s very comfortable and the material nice and soft
4.0,"Arrived super wrinkled,  but a couple trips through the wash and it looks ok"
4.0,"Great value for the price if you want darts for recreational play, parties, etc. Mine was missing one German flag fletch so I'm deducting a star (I really wanted that one!). You get a couple extra tail pieces but get shortchanged on the fletches?  Come on! Counting to 4 isn't difficult.  So far, they have held up against a lot of &#34;novice&#34; abuse.  If the seller sends me the missing fletch, I'll update my review."
4.0,"They are very thin, but would be better with an adjustable strap. Also found the lighter colors get dirty when taking on and off."
4.0,I don't feel confortable to use it I feel it slip on joy bra
4.0,Fits good and a decent quality.
4.0,"Fit as expected.  Soft feel and does not shrink.  I would give 5 stars, but the neck hole is almost too small.  Even in the  4XL.<br />I will purchase these pullovers again.  A good selection of colors and styles."
4.0,"Light weight, quick dry and cute while on.<br />However I got this for my 2 yr old in size 2-4 year and it just fits. Not sure it will make it through the summer"
4.0,Very cute. Runs small.
4.0,The adjustable straps are great & the lace at the bottom. Great for layering. Fits well except tight around hips.
4.0,"I love this dress. The shape is flattering; this is so comfortable - . Plus you can extend the wearing into fall by adding leggings & a cardigan on cooler nights. The colors are bright and beautiful - compliments my summer tan well. I would have liked for the designer to add pockets to the design but, otherwise it is prefect."
4.0,"Arrived today. All 5 have beautiful colors. Unfortunately too big for my head and neck. Also, the quality of the workman ship is not as good as I'd like to be. Will be returning them."
4.0,"This is for a Halloween costume. It fit perfectly, and I was surprised by how well made it is for the cost. The buttons weren't right for what I wanted, so I changed them, but otherwise it is great."
4.0,I love these sweaters!  I can dress them up or down. Great for my work attire and casual attire!
4.0,"This is a cute scarf, and I like the pretty pastel blue color. It has a cat face embroidered on one side of the scarf and a pom pom on the other. The scarf is on the shorter side, but fits fine as long as you aren’t expecting to be able to wrap it around your neck more than once the way it’s described. The shorter size means the scarf would be suitable for a child as well.<br /><br />Another difference from the description is the materials. The scarf isn’t 100% acrylic as described. It is actually made from 53% acrylic, 35% nylon, 9% wool, and 3% spandex. That’s not a bad blend as long as you’re not sensitive to wool.<br /><br />As long as you are okay with the discrepancies between the description and the actual item, this scarf would make a fun gift for the cat lover on your shopping list."
4.0,"Very simple material, light weight dries quick if wearing a wet bathing suit underneath. Looks cute on and easy to maneuver in while staying busy keeping up with kids on the beach"
4.0,Fits a little too small for a typical medium. I would recommend buying a large if you are on the border of sizes.
4.0,fit perfect .
4.0,"It's great. Fit as expected, one thing is that it's thin material and not great for winter. But I love that it's so comfortable and stylish at the same time"
4.0,"going on major hike over a month, and needed quick-drying shirts"
4.0,Like the dress will<br />purchase another one<br />Thanks
4.0,Fits somewhat small on my head though it is average. My ears feel like they are pressed to the hat. The hat though is plenty warm along with the mouth guard. Perfect for when it is snowing and you need to be outside for an hour or two and don't want your lips and nose frozen.
4.0,Very nice just my style I thought it would be a little heavier but I still love it thank you
4.0,"I just received them today, they look kind small in person, but I love them when I have them on."
4.0,"These are such cute earrings but they are very, very small. My 4 year old is a small girl and these are to small for her. These would be more for a baby."
4.0,"I have big wrists. It just fits, but this is a normal issue. I would prefer that the graphics were a shade darker."
4.0,I was told to buy a size bigger - needs slight adjustment but its a nice dress - I bought the black as well
4.0,Was skeptical getting a bathing suit from amazon. I love this suit! I only gave it 4 not 5 stars because it is not for people with a long torso and the cups are a little odd in that when I bend over it’s possible to pop out. Have not swam in it yet.
4.0,"Simple and nice looking. Sure, it feels a little cheap but it is cheap so what do you expect. Wore it to a wedding as a simple necklace. Worked well."
4.0,for the money these are decent sunglasses so good job
4.0,This is a comfortable and flattering mock turtleneck although it took a little while to get used to a long-sleeve crop top and the feeling of wearing a slight turtleneck. It's pretty versatile and I like it in black.
4.0,"Purchased these gloves due to Raynaud's.  They keep my fingertips warm but are not as good as the Chaval - which warm the entire fingers.  These gloves have a better heater control compared the Chaval - so I use the Hestra's on a daily basis for walking the dog, playing with the dog, shoveling the snow, and driving a frozen car.  The great thing about the Hestra's is that they are durable.  The Chaval's are used as my skiing gloves - as they keep my entire finger's warmer - which is great when riding up a chair lift into the blowing snow."
4.0,It's a great date night dress!
4.0,These are super comfortable and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on them. The only complaint is that I don’t love the material. It does look a little cheap. But overall I like them!
4.0,A nice product
4.0,"I had bought this dress to wear after an abdominal surgery.  It seems to run a little small, but I was still able to wear it comfortably around the house while recovering from surgery."
4.0,I bought size L and run kind of small...
4.0,"The bag looks great.  As a dad, I have it fully stocked and am not embarrassed to carry it around.  The list of necessities on the front flap is a nice touch and a good reminder to double check everything.<br /><br />Plenty of storage, but it seems a little slim width-wise.  However, I will say that it is still brand new, so I think it will widen itself out over time as it gets broken in."
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter, and she seemed to like their appearance very much.  I like the hairpin-like bar to hold the earrings to the upper part of her ears. I hope they are as comfortable as they are pretty!"
4.0,Great slippers for around the house and to get mail in. Not as much support as some would probably like but awesome if needed to walk in light snow outside.
4.0,"Nice hoodie, warm, will probably shrink over time."
4.0,pretty and easy to put on and take off on your own
4.0,Wash well and fit well.
4.0,Very comfortable. Reduces pain. Works better in conjunction with comfort saddle
4.0,"Looks nice. A lot of loose threads, though. Not so slim fitting. I dont think companies understand that slim fit means the waist area is smaller than the shoulder area. Not much difference with this shirt."
4.0,"I bought the black multi in 2x. I Am 5'8"" and wear anything between 16-20. First of all, the black multi is not true black, more a dark navy. Fabric and stitching were great. Mine was not see thru. I found it to have no shape on my body , just hung, so I gave it to my sister who has more booty than me and it hung much better...gave it some shape. Overall, the product is a great buy, it just didn't look good on my large chest/flat booty body. Oh! And even at 5'8"" , it came almost mid thigh in the back, so does cover your back end."
4.0,Ordered two packs for props as part of a parade costume. As others have said they were a little difficult to get apart. They didn't fit some us adults with bigger heads (we have more brains than then others 😉).  Sturdy enough to use again.
4.0,Just as described. Loved it.
4.0,These actually work wonderfully right up until when they rip in half. I wore them on a pair of RayBan Wayfarers. They will rip on glasses which are thick.<br /><br />Also I got made fun of by my hiking crew constantly. It just made me want to wear them more.
4.0,It is wonderful
4.0,Very nice material and design just a tad too small.
4.0,"I bought this knowing that cold shoulder tops run a little big, so I sized down. I probably could have purchased a medium, but this is a great legging shirt! I like shirts that cover the butt so I can wear them with leggings. Also, it's super cute! Stripes and cold shoulders are in, and this is the perfect shirt for it! 9/10 recommend"
4.0,Great belt. Bought as a replacement for the same belt.
4.0,Nicely made! Good looks!
4.0,"They look cool, work fine, and anti fog. I like to wear the one looks like ski goggle, but it does leak."
4.0,Very comfy and fun easy to dress up or down.
4.0,Really cute.  Color is exactly as pictured. Nice material.
4.0,Would have liked for them to be a little less shiny. They already have spots where the shine has gone. Looks spotty
4.0,Color is very dark brown so if that's what you want this is for you.  Very soft.
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is literally just a chain - perfect for a very minimalist look.  The chain is delicate-looking yet sturdy.  There are several different holes that the clasp can be affixed to, depending on your neck size and the length you are looking for.  Very nice for an understated look.<br /><br />I would not recommend giving this as a gift unless the recipient is wanting just a chain.  I forgot that I had ordered just a chain so when I opened the box I was puzzled at first and thought that them necklace was missing a charm."
4.0,"For those wondering how open the back is; expect a breeze from your shoulders to the small of your back. I bought this mostly for how it looked in the front since I was wearing a jacket with it. It fits nicely however, after a while there was a case of digging in my arms but that could be due to my linebacker shoulders xD"
4.0,simple slipper
4.0,These are undeniably pink. It worked out because that’s my sons favorite color but I was expecting red.
4.0,wasnt black like i thought it was in the pic its dark brown but its not that big a deal
4.0,Very pleased with style and colors.  Good quality for price.
4.0,Color and fabric is beautiful but it runs about two sizes too small. I wear a large (for the twins) but I ordered an XL to be comfortable and it was tight everywhere.
4.0,Decent feel. Spot on in size
4.0,"Top is great, not crazy about the bottoms - way too much of a &#34;brief&#34; fit and not flattering at all."
4.0,I only gave a four because it was a little small but with a bracelet extender it’s perfect
4.0,"Very tough and durable as far as the gloves are concerned.  The claws on each individual hand actually came off so I super glued them instead of just slipping the claws back on hoping they would stay in place. It appears as if the claws were hot melted in place just didn't keep them on. Once re-glued into place they do make things much easier to dig up and grip. Rubberized grip with claws is the way to go if you are doing yard work. Plus you get two pair instead of just one. Not bad for the price, just be warned the claws might come off, but glue them back on because the gloves themselves are very nice."
4.0,"This a a good quality band with one fatal flaw.<br /><br />Good: the mesh is of good quality and the plating seems resilient and well applied. The clasp is solid, and works well. Adjustment with this kind of band is easy.<br /><br />Bad: within 3 days of daily wear, the braze/solder joint that connects the spring pin holder to the mesh part of the watch separated. I have seen this a lot on lesser quality bands from China or otherwise (wouldn't happen with a Skagen or a Citizen). Since I am in the process of moving, a replacement wouldn't meet the timeframe and I was able to repair the joint with some careful application of JB-weld which remains strong and unseen after several high impact days of wearing the watch."
4.0,This dress is beautiful<br />I am 5’6 and about 170 and I got a large and it fit just right
4.0,"so far so good, good traction on the court and light on my feet."
4.0,"The fit was ok (I'm 220lbs 5'6&#34;, hourglass shape) but it wasn't the color I was looking for, and the belt was dirty.  I sent it back."
4.0,"The pattern was a bit bolder than I was expecting but really pretty. The shirt material is really soft and comfortable and I really enjoy wearing it. It is a very flowy style, so I can see why some would be hesitant to buy. However it is also very forgiving, if you get my drift. I'm 5,4 and 180 pds so I wanted something that covered everything and this worked extremely well. I ordered an x-large but probably could of gotten away with a large and still been really comfortable. But I wasn't sure how well it would hold up in the wash so I went up a size. Overall I'm pretty pleased with this shirt."
4.0,"Nice and faux as promised....Does the job and does not kill animals, for those so inclined, fast shipping, good price..."
4.0,"Purchased for a visiting nurse and she seemed pleased with the size, configuration and durability"
4.0,"Very good quality for the price and figure-flattering.  Followed sizing guide and fits well.  The straps are a little thin and not too strong, so not for busty women.  I am a 36c and at first it seemed like my chest would fall out of it, but I simply criss-crossed the straps in the back and that lifted me up and felt much more secure."
4.0,"Fits great. Very cute. The material is pretty thin. You cannot see through it, but it does tend to stick when I wear leggings under it."
4.0,I like these but they are a little difficult to put in your tragus.
4.0,Not a compression shirt just a slightly snug tank top. Comfortable enough. Don't expect it to suck up your gut or offer any support but it does it's job.<br />Your milage my vary.<br />Fyi I ordered the large.
4.0,"The fit of of this skort was great.  I have been searching for a brown skort, and I was expecting that the fabric might be shiny, but the color was disappointing.  It is actually more of a burgundy, not brown."
4.0,"very cute earrings I bought a set for my daughter and I, and these fit on our ears fine,they are able to fit in my top cartilage piercing and lower ear fine, posted a few pictures below, but we both have tiny ears this product seems made well, I placed clear polish on both sets just incase they peal, but have worn these in the shower many times and have held up nicely over the past 3 weeks"
4.0,"I purchased this suit to get more secure coverage for water therapy/exercise. The traditional cross/racer back suits for lap swimming are secure but they're more difficult to get on/off with a 34I chest and still don't cover high enough. This suit comes up all the way in the back (almost like a t-shirt would) and is easy on/off while still being secure due to the zipper being fully functional. I find that the high back does annoy me a bit on the back of my neck but I think that may be due to my chest pulling it forward. I purchased an XL based on reviews and the fact that I have a large bust. I would prefer a smaller size for the lower half of my body (14) to avoid the extra fabric and have it be a little more snug but needed the space up top so I stuck with the XL. I do think it depends on your body shape considering the other reviews so you may want to take that into account. I have wide hips and find the bottom to be decent fitting. Overall a very good suit, holding up well after chlorine use 5x per week and soaking/rinsing afterwards before hand wash."
4.0,"I purchased this dress as a back up dress. I had ordered a much more expensive dress from a different site. Unfortunately it never arrived. I am a curvy girl so I ordered a size up. The dress was long in the back, and the zipper stuck no matter what. I took the dress for alterations and had &#34;hook & eyes&#34; added to the zipper so it wouldn't stick and would lay flat. I also had the small breast cups removed.<br />I ordered a solid gold belt to accompany the dress.<br /><br />Looks good all together."
4.0,"I bought this for my first time flying. I wanted a small purse to hold my phone, passport and boarding pass. I have a Samsung Note 4 with a pretty slim case. The purse all the contents I needed but the zipper wasn't able to close around everything. I didn't mind because I kept it close by at all time and I usually held my phone in my hand due to texting/anxiety anyway.<br /><br />Otherwise this purse is 10/10. The chain is awesome. The material is great quality for the price. I'd buy other products from this seller if this was the guaranteed quality."
4.0,Special Occasion accessories!
4.0,Very pretty pendant. I only gave it four stars because of the necklace itself is very cheap. How the pendant looks in the picture is what it looks like in real life.
4.0,"Nice pattern and material. I wear a 6 usually so I ordered a small, but the dress runs smaller than size chart specifies. I re-ordered in a medium."
4.0,"This product does run small but it was what I wanted, it gave me the look I wanted. I'm 5'8"", 200lbs."
4.0,"Comfortable fit, but the single diamond on the chest was kind of weird. I honestly didn't even notice it had one until I got it in the mail."
4.0,Daughter wore this for her unicorn birthday and loved it.  The only drawback is each color is a separate piece
4.0,"Runs small.  I will be returning  . I wear a size small iordered a medium. I  will order the large this time. I am 5'3 1/2  120 the small b<br />The swim suit is worth the hassle. Looks great, just need the right size"
4.0,"I ordered a small but I ended up wanting a medium, it took a couple days to get used to them but I think they're cute and I like them. The come with a little bag which is nice. I would recommend buying these they don't affect your vision at all"
4.0,"Very pretty, just like the picture! The pendant is too heavy for the chain, it broke soon after giving it to her for her birthday."
4.0,Nice and comfortable casual dress. Good price for product. Glad I bought it.
4.0,The black started wearing off quickly on the leather when the gloves got wet.
4.0,"Its a pretty nice mini purse for the every day stuff, its smaller than what it appears but sure very helpfull. Its perfect when you dont want to take a big purse and only take the basic stuff. I like it its nice goes with everything for any ocasion. The shipping was very fast it came before the due date. I would recomended"
4.0,A little thin but OK. They are comfy.
4.0,one was a little scratched but otherwise very good
4.0,Runs a little small but cute design and soft
4.0,"Rope has withered away over the course of three years, but the amulet itself remains in perfect condition. I wore this necklace for three years consecutively, and I am satisfied with its quality."
4.0,I got these for my girlfriend and she loves em. Wears em everyday to work. The size and sparkle are worth the low price!
4.0,"Order ur size, only flaw was that it was abut to baggy in the front waist area other than she like it."
4.0,Good size for me but twice the clasp has come undone and friends have warned me that my earring was about to fall off. I think they are pretty so I will keep wearing them and hopefully not lose one!
4.0,Good material and finish. Add didn't mentioned item comes from China took longer than expected
4.0,"Pretty good bag! I usually can fit my laptop case (with the laptop inside), a sketchbook, pencil case, calculator, a journal, and two 1-subject notebooks. The only thing that I wish this bag had is some sort of cushioning inside so when I set it down all my stuff doesn't get damaged."
4.0,This wallet is smaller than I even imagined. Holds about 3 cards snugly and has the money clip with a strong magnet for bills. Perfect for wearing tight fitted pants or discretely having a wallet without any bulge.
4.0,Don't expect a big bag. It was a regular sized bag but if you want a huge bag this isn't it. Looks and feels like great quality.
4.0,"I used these on my 8 month old, they fit a little big but I believe my son has small feet right now in general so that might have been why. They are cute, exactly as pictured, soft upper fabric and sturdy elastic as well as a well made bottom grip sole. The &#34;spikes&#34; on the bottom are not sharp or dangerour in any way, they are pliable and fun for playing with as a new sensory texture. Helped him get a better grip while walking on our wood floors."
4.0,"is beautiful, fits the costume well, Only issue is that the ties are a bit too short  for me to wrap around my torso, (I'm a large man at 6' 200#)"
4.0,"I have a small face so these are a tad bit big, but I will wear them anyway.  Maybe someone will think I am famous and I am just trying to hide from my public!!"
4.0,"They were a lot bigger than I thought they were going to be, I hung it around my mirror instead!"
4.0,"I love Ekouaer products, especially their pajamas, so I was excited to see this new product and order it. It's well made, the ribbed knit fabric is pretty, and it fits true to size. It has a drop shoulder, elbow length sleeves, and most of the time one side is riding down on your shoulder, but this is intentional. These are very comfortable pajamas, another excellent Ekouaer product. But.<br /><br />This is a big ""but."" These pajamas are see-through. I walk my dog first thing after I crawl out of bed, and in the summertime, it's so hot here that I like to wear a lightweight robe over my PJs. I would be afraid to walk my dog wearing these, even under a robe, because the fabric is completely see-through. I got these in black, and they are very pretty, but I'd like them a lot more if the fabric was thicker.<br /><br />It's possible that I'm missing the point and that these PJs are see-through for a reason; they aren't made with consideration for walking your dog first thing in the morning. These would be great to wear for a special evening with your special someone. Just have him walk the dog in the morning.<br /><br />Very good product, top quality fabric and craftsmanship, definitely a different, sexy look for summer PJs. Unfortunately, these are completely see-through and not something you could wear to walk your dog, even under a robe, or around your children. As noted above, I may be missing the point of these PJs; maybe they're meant to be sexy and see-through. Fit is true to size. The collar does slide down one shoulder frequently, but it's meant to do that. These are pretty, very sexy pajamas, but they are not PG-rated, and the listing should've included the fact that they are so sheer. Still, they are another excellent Ekouaer product."
4.0,"Great watch for $10. I’m a G-Shock collector and needed a thin watch to wear under some of my sweatshirts and jackets in the winter. My G-Shocks are to big for certain jackets I wear. Full of basic features , quality and reliability for just ten dollars."
4.0,"Material is nice, beautiful color. Had to give away as fit is very small."
4.0,"I usually wear a dress size 8 or so, typically M. I got a L and can’t close it, lol. Trying XL, and I’ll update on quality."
4.0,"Love the colors, pattern and fit of this top, but it is too short to work well as a tunic to wear with leggings."
4.0,Generally nice however there was one or two styles that was too small for a big man.
4.0,Really cute And fit great
4.0,"Very cute , but runs super small . I’m a L and that’s what I ordered but it fits like a S !"
4.0,Fit me a little too tight
4.0,Nice a light weight and great variety. I suggest buying/using different backs. I’ve had some be a little lose and fall off. Easy fix to a cute and good deal!
4.0,Was returned due to size runs small! In spite of that material & dress looked ok. Will need to get next size
4.0,kids loved them got lots to choose from
4.0,"These were ok for bracelets. I have small wrists, so they were pretty big or loose on my wrists. And because of that the tie strings would get in the way. All in all, good price, good quality, not meant for people with small wrists lol."
4.0,Every classy looking! Loved it
4.0,"Hmmmm...... I'm torn as to how I want to review this item. It's cute, that's for sure, but it's definitely snug. The elastic banding isn't very stretchy which is nice for keeping it up where you want it but it makes getting the suit over your hips and belly (if you have one) a bit of an exercise in determination. Once on though, it's comfortable. Also, while the extended &#34;boy short&#34; cut is cute if you're blessed with (or have worked hard to achieve) nice trim thighs, it's a bit cumbersome for slightly lumpier ladies (I *definitely* fall into the later category) and with the elastic banding not being particularly elastic like, it's a little snug and makes for some less than flattering muffin-top-esq thigh bulges. Also, while the front panel is lined, the back half is not lined and can looks flimsy and stretched out. It's not so much of an issue on the top half, but if you have a booty, you could end up stretching the fabric more than you may want and risk giving people a peek at your crack if you're unfortunate enough to be in the wrong lighting (like a bright sunny day.... ask me how I know....) I've remedied both the issue of thigh bulge and surprise butt crack by wearing a cute pair of black swim shorts over the top which honestly I do with all of my bathing suits. So it works out. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the cups are fairly supportive though I do tie the halter up pretty tight to lift the girls to a respectable location and make use of the super cute &#34;peek-a-boo cutout&#34; which honestly is the whole reason I bought the suit in the first place. My only other complaint is that it's more of an orangish red than it is a true red. Overall I'd buy it again, just one size up!"
4.0,It’s very pretty just runs big. The small is more like a medium. The torso and waist area is super huge and loose. I hate that but I think I can make it work because the hips down look ok. I just wish it fit tighetjer on my upper body. Why are all these smalls not small these days
4.0,Overall very cute but it runs very large. I ordered a 7 for my index finger and it’s barely fitting my thumb.
4.0,"This is a very classy, yet sexy shirt. The material is stretchy, which is nice, but it seems to run small. I typically wear small shirts, but because it's a body hugger, it does show lots of bumps. I am pretty fit, 5 8 1/2 and 125, and I am going to order a medium as small was just too tight for me, including upper arms and back. Otherwise, it's a great shirt, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it!"
4.0,"It is tight and rides up a bit. The colors are beautiful, the cut is well done the fabric a bit stretchy...overm to be comfortable I would order a large the next time around."
4.0,"Dress is beautiful with great movement. Not as structured as it appears in photo, but stands a little. I recommend coupling with a small petticoat if you desire the amount of flare pictured."
4.0,"Cute pants, but I didn't realize they were high waisted which wasn't what I was looking for. They are comfy and sporty though."
4.0,"Was a little tighter than it needed to be, but it worked for what I needed it to, so all is well."
4.0,"Not see thru, fit really well & very elegant. Wore for my rehearsal dinner & got tons of compliments"
4.0,Used this as part of my daughters Halloween costume. Better quality than expected even though it was cheap! Did tangle up bad as soon as my daughter started jumping around in it.
4.0,"It's really comfortable to wear and overall I'm super happy with it.  I'm a little disappointed because it's a tad bit longer than I'd like.  I'm about 5'5/5'6 so it's difficult to find things that fit just right, so I cut it some slack.  Still wish it fit a little better.  But for the average guy, it will fit just fine.  I really am happy about it."
4.0,"jacket was a bit snug, definitely like the design"
4.0,They are a lil bigger than expected but still are very comfortable. I'm sure I'll get lots of use from these boots.
4.0,"I have now tried 4 sets of goggles, all mid size, to find the right ones and I finally did but it was not these, but these were the next best.<br /><br />I got these and was pretty impressed. It was not too hard to get a decent seal and once on they were fairly comfortable. I did have to fuss a bit to get and keep a seal. They do distort a bit underwater like some people have noted but for fitness swimming, it was not an issue. I forgot them one day after using them a few times so decided to try the Speedo Hydrospex goggles they had for sale at the gym and I liked those better.<br /><br />The seal, on my face, was almost perfect right away and I don't find myself fussing with them as much. They have a single flange but it sticks out further and is softer which is why I might get a better and a little more comfortable seal. The speedos have the dual band which help with getting a good fit but at the expense of them getting twisted all the time.  That just seems to be the cost of having a dual band. I really like the clip on the Agend but didn't use it much once I had the fit the way I liked it.and the single band is easier to put on even without using the buckle.<br /><br />The Hydrospex felt like a more quality unit. The vision on the Speedo was clearer and I felt like it had better peripheral vision (also nice and clear). For me, the peripheral vision on the Hydrospex was just right.<br /><br />I was initially pretty impressed with the Agend  for the price and they fit me pretty well, but they are now my spares behind the speedos which are only a few dollars more."
4.0,the belts are good quality. the color and design is the same as in the picture. I'm not sure how well it will stay put since i haven't worn them out. I'm a little doughy and since these are 'one size fits all'  the belts kind of go into my waist line in an unflattering way.
4.0,"Straps are not taught and stretchy so support is not good for larger bust, but good coverage low v neck."
4.0,"Nice floral dress. while the fabric is not thin, a large bust will stretch the top and it can be a bit see-thru. I'm keeping it as I bought it on lightening deal and can wear a cami underneath. Cute with jean jacket, tights, boots, and tassel necklace. Ordered a medium as I have in past with the short sleeve version of this dress and it fit well. 5'5"" 158lbs. and 36DD for reference."
4.0,bought it to give as a gift and my friend just loved it..
4.0,Loved this! Used a few times and the last time it slid off while dancing. Thank God I have on a long ball gown!
4.0,Vety attractive and made well. Do help with computer glare. Gave it 4 stars only because have to remove for regular reading etc. Its like reading thru sun glasses
4.0,i recommend ordering 1 size up to fit comfortably
4.0,Burgundy is more like true red. Pretty sweater. Fits nicely. Material is a little itchy.
4.0,Classy and gorgeous. Use it for evenings out. Nice product.
4.0,"This is a great fit and cut. The fabric is thin, and has little stretch but that didn’t bother me much. It is much longer than I had hoped. I’m 5 ‘2 and the bottom hits about 4 inches below my knee which is akward. I’ll have to get it hemmed. Otherwise classy and great dress for work or a dinner date."
4.0,Expensive but nice to wear
4.0,"Chain was longer than I anticipated, a little more bronze colored than gold, but otherwise a great and enjoyable gift."
4.0,Love the colors and will keep it.
4.0,A size 10 in womens fits more like a size 10 in mens. Returned for a full refund.
4.0,"The shirt seems well made and fits true to size.  I haven't worn it yet, but it is very pretty.  May need to wear something under it."
4.0,Worked well enough but better for a smaller bust
4.0,it looks good. i didn't realize that the design in the front is actual holes. i want to wear it to work so i will have to wear something under it.
4.0,"Very comfortable and lightweight. Wore for a wedding rehearsal, but can be worn for a dressy occasion."
4.0,It's nice but it said little turtle and it's pretty big. Nice quality for the price.
4.0,Works just fine as a replacement for the leads I lost for my DMM but it does take a while to arrive. The only complaint I have is that the black probe can come out of the DMM rather easily but as long as I'm careful it is not an issue. For that reason I chose to deduct one star from what would otherwise have been a perfect review.<br /><br />Please vote on if this review was helpful and comment with any questions! I'm trying to review my way to being a top reviewer and it helps out (: Will update review if any issues arise in the future.
4.0,Waste is tight!
4.0,"I ordered this backpack to use for work.  I am a paraeducator working with an elementary school student.  I need a variety of objects for my work: a timer for breaks, a dry erase board and marker, paperwork about what we do each day, as well as other supplies such as extra pencils and crayons.  In my previous classroom, I had a desk next to my student where I kept my materials.  In the classroom before that, I had a designated space in the room where I could keep my things.  With my new student, we change classrooms throughout the day and I don't have anywhere to keep my supplies on hand.  I ordered this backpack because I was tired of using my full size (extra large) college backpack.  This bag takes up less space and holds all of my essentials.  The narrow straps do hurt my shoulders if I wear this bag for an hour continuously, but it's fine for me since I only need to walk for a minute or two to reach a new classroom at work.<br /><br />This bag works well if you have only a few large items to keep track of but not as well if you want to organize many smaller items.  The small compartment on the front of the bag is useful for emergency supplies such as gloves and a mini first aid kit.  However, I feel this bag could be improved by having two main compartments, rather than just one.  My even-smaller-than-this-one mini-backpack (which I use as a purse) has two main compartments, plus the front compartment, and I find this better for organization than a single large compartment.<br /><br />It would also be helpful if the small pockets inside the large compartment were bigger.  There are two small pockets on the front and on the back wall of the large compartment (for a total of four small pockets).  However, neither my wallet nor my smartphone is small enough to slide into the small pockets, so I am considering removing the stitching to make a single small pocket on each side.  I prefer the multiple small pockets, some with zippers, on the inside of my purse-backpack.  As it stands, I have to throw all of my supplies into the large compartment, which makes it hard to find the individual object I am looking for if I have more than 3 or 4 objects in the backpack at once.  (I can hook all my pens onto one of the pockets, and then they stay in place).<br /><br />Also, I checked the dimensions of this backpack before purchasing it: the bag is slightly shorter and wider than a piece of standard typing paper.  I decided that the bag would probably be flexible enough to zip a piece of paper inside.  This is true of a single piece of paper (which is then in danger of becoming crumpled or bent) but not of a clipboard or binder which is any larger or thicker than a piece of paper.  As shown in the attached image, I can squeeze one corner of the clipboard into the bag, but then the second corner doesn't stretch far enough to close and zip.  Knowing this, I might have ordered one of the bags that are larger than this one, while still smaller than a full-size backpack.  (A composition notebook, however, which is narrower and shorter than a piece of paper, does fit into the backpack)."
4.0,So far so good. I really like these multi-focus glasses. I've used them to dive so far and they are fine.
4.0,"The amber tine gathers light nicely, they fit comfortable,  I may need to close up the ends, but otherwise, just what i was hoping for. Planning on wearing them next time I skirmish."
4.0,"Evidently, they know their product!  When I opened it, four pearls and two rhinestones had already fallen off.  **BUT** they also included two tiny tubes of repair glue.  I guess the sellers were expecting it!  Also, most of the upright parts were a little bent, giving the whole thing a rather drunken look.  I was able to straighten them by hand, and even though I worried it would knock off more rhinestones, they stayed on.<br /><br />The crown itself is very circular, and does not bend to fit to your head.  I recommend starting with an elaborate fluffy up-do, and then attaching this crown to your hair, rather than just letting it sit on your head.  It IS beautiful, and not a design you see everywhere on internet shopping."
4.0,nice for the price.<br />I like the spring-loaded frames.<br />have ordered 2 more as backup.
4.0,These are pretty bracelets. There are 7 identical bracelets and then 7 unique ones. They have a good stretch to them so they can fit a variety of wrist sizes. They are pretty and have nice stones. These would be perfect for goody bags!
4.0,"The glasses came nicely packaged, and are true to the pictures, and they fit nicely. The reason I give 4 stars is because the shades are actually blue when you look through them and I was expecting rose, brown or even grey. I’m not a big fan of the blue tint to everything :/"
4.0,"They are pretty lots of compliments, but small"
4.0,The pants were very cute but the waist was extremely small
4.0,"It's a bit big in the bust, but otherwise fits fine.  The straps won't stay on which is frustrating. It's really cute though."
4.0,"Fine product, excellent shipping."
4.0,"Smaller than normal.  For the loose look, ne d 2 sizes larger."
4.0,Perfect workout gear. Would buy again
4.0,Definitely runs tight/small.<br />I absolutely recommend going up a size.<br />The sewing around the buttons is shoddy.<br />But other than that it's overall good.
4.0,Exactly as described just a little big for my 6 year old but great quality.
4.0,They fit is perfect but I will say the first glove I tried putting on ripped from the bottom while I doing the last tuck so all my finger could be on all the way. They second I eased up on my pull force and was good.
4.0,I like the color and it was affordable.
4.0,Very nice. Works well so far no complaints.
4.0,"5’6” / 125ish / Athletic Build | I ordered a small (against my instinct) in the sunflower pattern. It fits and isn’t super snug to the point where I feel uncomfortable, but I think I would have been happier in a medium. I don’t have super broad shoulders or chubby upper arms and it’s just snug enough to make me feel like I might be pushing it in this dress. Regardless, I’m still happy with the length. Mental note made not to throw it in the dryer and to order a medium in the floral patterns."
4.0,I ordered my size and it is way to small looks more Like a medium then an 2x
4.0,The fabric is a little lighter weight than expected but I still like it.
4.0,"Cute, but break if stretched!"
4.0,"looks great, but sometimes sets slightly crooked"
4.0,Pretty but on the thin side so it's hard to put in the little tihng that helps it from falling off.
4.0,nice hat for summer
4.0,"It is somewhat small, but I have a large chest. The arms are also a little tight. It fits very well everywhere else and fits well enough that I am keeping it."
4.0,Very spacious and convenient while traveling.
4.0,I used this in our church services and it sounds great. The paint is a little fragile but has a great sound.
4.0,"I like  these glasses,I have bought them before the only thing is they scratch easily."
4.0,"The color is gorgeous and the fit is flawless. The quality of the fabric and the construction is great. Style wise, it is sleek, elegant and stylish but it feels very retro; if retro is your thing, go for it... Anyway, my wife loved it, thus can’t complain.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!"
4.0,"The dress is really nice, it’s just a little short-waisted on me."
4.0,"Amazing suit!!! Super cute but not too revealing. Love the tie at the top on the back. My only complaint is the “ruffles” on the straps can twist and stand straight up. I don’t care, this suit is an awesome value! Great material!<br /><br />I am 5’7, 145 lbs, very muscular. I bought the XL. It is snug enough that there no gaps but is not tight/form fitting (just how I like this type of suit)!"
4.0,They are what I expected
4.0,I LOVE all things hans cuffs. I'm glad I bought this the only thing I wish would have been different is the zirconia stud. I wish it was smaller being that it was so large it's obvious that the earrings are not real that the stone was smaller it could pass as white gold very good quality earrings I would purchase it in from the seller
4.0,"I've been ordering this underwear for my daughters since 2 years old, I love the quality, fit and material. I have ordered this new style Jamie Performance for my 6.5 years old daughter size 7-8 but it's exactly the same size as size 6 100% Cotton Girls Underwear, Briefs Style, Gracie, therefore too small.<br />The sizing for this style is not accurate, so I give 4 stars. Unfortunately I already washed them so I can't return."
4.0,So cute!  Love the fit and the colors
4.0,"I have big hands, and they are a little small. But the quality is very good."
4.0,"I’m giving this purchase four stars because the swimsuit is nice. However, the sizing is off and this definitely fits more like a medium. The top because it has adjustable straps works for me but the bottoms measurements are definitely inaccurate."
4.0,"The fit is great. The material is quite thin and see-through, and pills easily. You definitely have to wear another shirt under it, which kind of defeats the purpose of a loose, flowy tank top. It is a really cute pattern though."
4.0,Love for nights out for something more fancy
4.0,"For the price, this is very cute. I feel like the clasp may be backward, and it is hard to put on myself. Other than that I like the bracelet, the metal pieces are thin and may bend easy, but as with all jewelry you need to be careful and not break it. I would buy this again."
4.0,"Very pleased with the comfort of these pants, plus there are pockets! It is like having work-appropriate sweatpants. However, being 5'3"" (170 lbs) and ordering a large they might need to be hemmed as they drag a bit on the ground. I might be able to get a medium next time and solve some of the length issues. I will definitely be going back for another pair!"
4.0,The shirt is super cute and fits really well but I noticed a hole while wearing for the first time.
4.0,cute and simple  i love it
4.0,"Nice one-layer mask, sturdy material will survive the washing machine without fading the print. No filter pocket. It is Huge. Lol. Probably best to use with one of those plastic turtle frame thingies."
4.0,"Nice cut, VERY soft and comfortable, very pleased with the workmanship and finish.  I just wish it the fabric was a bit more breathable."
4.0,It's a cute dress but I'm only 5'7 and it stopped right before my ankles. I was hoping it would fit longer like the pictures.
4.0,I really like the wickin material and bold colors.
4.0,A little big but granddaughter can grow into them very cute
4.0,Fits as expected.  A bit snug but they work.
4.0,Their ok
4.0,"The eyeliner worked, but it stung after application. I’m not sure what happened, but I only used it once. It was easy to use, but I won’t be using again."
4.0,"I have a very tiny wrist, wish I could adjust the ring size and bracelet size"
4.0,I used the 10L bag and was able to stuff all kinds of incidentals including a large towel and change of light clothes and sandals.  The handle on the phone cover is not good.  It snapped off with a minimal amount of effort.  I had to tie the handle around the bar that the strap clipped too.  I also dropped it into Dunn's River Falls and it floated on top.  Pretty good darn bag!
4.0,are they real
4.0,"The light up is super cool, however it really drains the battery."
4.0,"Looks great, rugged yet elegant. Thick. One star off for being a bit short. I am 6' and my wrists aren't that thick. I use the second to last hole and at that point the tip the sticks out is not long enough to be held down by the stopper loop. Read complaints about big buckle. Yes it's big but doesn't bother me."
4.0,Wonderful color and nicely made. it DOES run a little LARGE
4.0,wind still gets u on motorcycle but<br />otherwise awesome
4.0,"Jacket is nice and warm and water resistant with the pockets where I expected. There are 2 hook and loop areas one on each arm the right size for a flag on one and unit patch on the other. The hood absolutely sucks since there is no colar to speak of, you either roll the hood up and have an awkward colar or you have the hood deployed and have a definite military style way to sinch it down. Hell, on one side the cordage to pull the hood got accidentally sewen into the lining so it's disabled. Definitely military spec lol, if the Army made it, it's probably broken."
4.0,Love the lavender smell and the colored felt discs so I change the look to match what I'm wearing.
4.0,"These, so far, look like they will work pretty well.  Even though they are ""golf"" I thought I would try them on my snow/ice running shoes and have run in them once (2"" packed snow) after installing.  The only question is one of reliability but these are better than the ""strap on"" cleats out there that I am just uncomfortable with..."
4.0,"Fits well, wish the dress was lined. Hope it won’t fade after the first wash but looks good"
4.0,"It arrived on time, and it’s just the right size. It looks great."
4.0,Comfortable and wash well.  Never going to last long due to quality in how they are made
4.0,"I like the material it's not too thin or to thick ,cute pattern"
4.0,It's a bit bulky but works great!
4.0,"Other ""Readers"" offered online were cheaper but were not tinted yellow. That tint apparently helps somehow with the Blue Light of computer monitors. I have had them for 1 day and they seem to be what was promised. Albeit a little smaller than I expected but still fine. The best part is they came in 2 days which no other provider could promise at this time."
4.0,"Very cute shirt. I do love it for its style and it’s softness. I usually wear a large in most tops since I have a larger chest. But this top is really big, definitely size down, even if you are looking for an oversized look with leggings- still size down."
4.0,"Beautiful beautiful beautiful! It’s all What I was expecting my only complaint is that lace in the Waist is see-through but it’s a small area  and I can fix it. I will Update my review after I wear it. For reference: I am 38C. 160 pounds, 5.4, l order XXL."
4.0,"The glasses are nice and functional.It is true it can help you with the glare.I have some others-fish-glasses, but it looks not so nice.However the product is good it could be less heavy.Still like it."
4.0,"I am larger 5'4"" 190lbs.  It just was not flattering on me. I wanted to like this dress but it didn't look good on me.  The color (purple) is a brighter than what is pictured the front is not sheer but from the waist up in the back is completely sheer.  The sleeves and length were good, unless your thin like the model you'll look like a purple Marshmallow. I did"
4.0,Love the product and please bring the blue faced wood watch back in stock. Also a blue stained wood with a cream vanilla watch face would fly off the shelves.. Cut me a check please.. R Brown
4.0,"As someone who is only a 34 A/B, even I thought this had fairly little support.  It's good for laying around, but you certainly aren't going to go out dancing and jumping around in it.  I wish it had more elastic.  However, still cute straps and enough support.  I'd imagine anyone with a bigger bra size wouldn't be super pleased."
4.0,They  dont stay put on my feet when wearing shoes. I have to pull them up almost after every step.
4.0,Was used to cover bathing suit. 7
4.0,Nice belt ... Seams secure and robust .. Was purchased in conjunction with HSGI<br />Battle belt
4.0,"The 2X large was a good fit, (I'm 6 foot 235lb) I like my shirts a little bigger than this but it was definitely acceptable. I'll be buying more from this seller."
4.0,This Visor is adjustable so it fits even though I have a fairly small head. It is fashionable and blocks the sun perfectly.
4.0,"I usually wear a 3x and I got a 5x in this dress because I just felt it might run small.  I am glad I did the 5x fits perfectly everywhere but the hips, it is a little bit big in the hips.  It is a gorgeous dress but delicate, be careful with it."
4.0,very attractive and fits comfortable
4.0,I wear a size medium (8/10) & it fits great. A little baggy but I like robes to be on the loose side. The sleeves are a bit short but it’s nothing I can’t overlook since it’s so soft & warm. It’s perfect for lounging around the house in the morning or getting out of the shower. Good construction & quick delivery!
4.0,"Great for cold weather, warm but not bulky. Only problem is the arm openings are a little small, I wear Medium but had to replace with Large Size for comfort under the arms, which makes it a little big at the waist, but still a good buy."
4.0,"This watch is a classic, the battery seems to run on for ever and the cost is cheap enough that I don't have to worry about scratching or damaging the watch. One down side is the strap seems to break after a year or two and replacement straps are about the same price as the watch."
4.0,Very colorful true to size and cute. Great material
4.0,"THey are a tad bit snug, but that's fine. The only issue is that the snap pups open too easily. Love them other than that."
4.0,This product was great for me just what I wanted light weight and great protection from the sun.
4.0,why I didnot know about it earlier? Most valuable for automatic watches.<br />Now I never need to shake watch in the morning. Its peacefully resting in its house<br />with machine swinging it in its bed
4.0,"I liked the pleats in the front but the material is clingy... I don’t like the types of dresses that stick to you or your underwear. Cute dress, just not my style."
4.0,not that bat :)
4.0,"Fits my large glasses. The hook is a little difficult to open and close, but I am satisfied for the price."
4.0,Cute but bulky sort of heavy on your arm. only wear on certain occassions
4.0,Using to protect goggles when not in use. The thickness of the material is very good
4.0,"I ordered this dress in green & size small. I’m 5’2 & about 120lbs - I’d say this fits like a size 2 or 4.  I’m usually a 2 & this fit well but I did feel like there was a little extra room/fabric...but that may be due to the material. It’s soft, not see through, dark green, & comfortable. I wore it to a work holiday party & got a lot of compliments. Would recommend!"
4.0,the fabric is good
4.0,"Super cute, soft, well made shirt. I have chunky arms, so wish the sleeves were a little longer. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, it is flowy and the satan like material makes it perfect for any event."
4.0,"There’s really nothing that I don’t like about this watch, with the exception of the size of the band. I have larger wrists, so I am having to secure it in the next to last hole, which means that the remaining length is left to flap since it doesn’t want to stay in the secure ring. I will likely have to get a replacement band to fix the issue. Functionality and comfort are both a plus. Great watch!"
4.0,"I ordered the nude color which has a pale pink tone to it. Actually, the color was very close to the original Anne Klein band. I was pleased with the color. Personally, I'm not a fan of the smooth leather..prefer textured leather. The fit is comfortable and the shipping was fast."
4.0,"Serves the need for a white dinner jacket, not supreme quality, but will serve my needs very well."
4.0,Great packaging nice product
4.0,The cups were a bit big but I had expected that. It looks really cool and I like it.
4.0,"Great quality wArm gloves! Just i cant use my phone with it , had to take it out all the time to use my phone"
4.0,"Good fit, I wish pockets were a little deeper for keys"
4.0,I love this bag. It's small but big enough to carry my everyday item to work
4.0,"Just got this-size XL, I usually wear a 16 or 18 in dresses and this fits great.  Love that it makes me look tall.  Super comfortable.  I am 5'7 1/2"" and the length is perfect-for flats or even barefoot.  The only thing I might like is if the opening to the pockets was bigger-I have large hands and every time I remove my hands from the pockets they want to turn inside out a bit because my hand sticks in the opening.....however this does mean the pockets shouldn't ever gap and since is this a soft material it might be worth the trade off.  My phone fits nicely in the pocket and they are deep enough it won't risk falling out.  I could live in this dress."
4.0,"Very cute and stylish on my keys! Its very long, yet makes it easy to locate keys in my purse."
4.0,Sweater is warm and soft. Great to wear with leggings. Runs a little big. I suggest sizing down. Overall a great trendy sweater for the price!
4.0,Like it easy to get on and off!!
4.0,"Pretty top, but a little too flowy."
4.0,"Originally, I was looking for this shape of earring in purple (these earrings are also available in purple, which I bought as well). I am cautious of dangle earrings because most do not stay in my piercings and end up lost; these earrings come with sizeable, post-like backs so that you put them in like a stud, rather than just hooking them through your piercing and hoping they stay in like you would with most dangle earrings. Also, I have fairly bad allergies to cheap or even cheap-ish metal- gold, silver, plated, whatever; these earrings do not make my earlobes itchy or sore at all! I would say these earrings are noticeable and definitely &#34;swingy&#34;, but are not so large as to be gaudy or heavy. The only reasons I gave these earrings 4 stars are that they, if at all green, are green-tinged, and because they may be considered a bit dressy for every day wear. But they will be wonderful for a special occasion or event and, as the stone is basically colorless, will look great with any outfit! I think these earrings are well worth the price!!"
4.0,Good product with traction and arch support. The Velcro straps do not do much for the appearance and cannot be adjusted tight. Good for wear around the house or a short walk to the mailbox.
4.0,"Great for a 4 year old! Still too big at the tightest setting, but she loves it.<br /><br />I have worn it myself (when she wants to take it off and I don’t want to lose it) and it’s actually a pretty attractive watch and a good size for an adult with small wrists.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like is that it’s too easy for the buttons to be pressed, so she accidentally turns on alarms- I know how to turn them off now, but it’s not intuitive."
4.0,"My son went as the new Joker for Comic-Con this year. These were a little large for him since he's only 10, but if you're an adult, I bet you'll find these fit very well."
4.0,I'm a size 6 with 34C top & imperfect bottom. I got medium. Maybe I could have gone smaller This dress hides unsmoothness well. I got another one like it. Decent material.
4.0,"This is a great product! The material is very soft and I really love that about it! However, I bought medium since I usually wear medium in pants but I think its a bit too small to my liking. This medium fit like lights and like an underwear. Infact when I put it on it looked like an underwear lol. I would def recommend to those who want that look. I may return for a larger size. The design of the pants is weird, and that I like too. Nevertheless, the size was not to my liking! but great material!!!"
4.0,"My son loves this lanyard and Pikachu character, and for the most part it’s actually a pretty decent quality. The one thing that does kind of suck about it is that the Pikachu character is an obvious knock off, there’s no detail to him, it just looks super cheap in general, but overall it serves it purpose well and my kid is happy with it."
4.0,Like. Make outfit look amazing.
4.0,Fast delivery and items were as described. Looks great with jeans.
4.0,"When I bought this I know the description said coral, but it looked more red to me.  It is definetly coral.  The necklace itself is also very large.  Seller should maybe show on a model for buyers to get a grasp of the scale."
4.0,This product was great for the cost
4.0,Pretty and pretty well-made for a toy.
4.0,"Very comfortable and stretchy. I am 5’9”, 150lbs, and athletic. I got a size M and they tend to slide down when I run. Other than that, they are great workout pants."
4.0,Good for a little lift in the shoulders.  Not bulky.  Wish it was a little larger.
4.0,"Seems to run a little bit small, but not too bad. Decent, cheap hoodie."
4.0,I bought this for my Mom as a gift. She loves it. Unfortunately it came with a little hole in the front. I did not want to take the time to send it back and my Mom wanted to start wearing it! She loves it despite the hole!
4.0,"The center-most part doesn't stay down at the bottom, but other than that, it's great! It looks very good."
4.0,"I am very careful of what I put through my earlobes. Once past my teen years my earlobes would not accept just anything at all. My earrings have to be gold post or better. Even so, I dip the part going through the lobe in hydrocortisone cream, as well as the lock piece that goes behind the ear.<br /><br />This ear piece looked interesting enough for me to take a chance. 18K gold plated should be enough, right? Turns out, yes, 18K gold plated IS enough. I have worn the cuff for almost 24 solid hours and my earlobe is perfectly fine. (I did dip it in hydrocortisone cream though.) It is so light weight that I keep forgetting it is there. I have already had a few compliments about it.<br /><br />As with everything I review for Amazon's Vine, I will come back and edit this review if I have any trouble."
4.0,Very beautiful and complimentary to my body.
4.0,"Loved the look, very nice bracelet. But the tassle fell off after having it a few weeks."
4.0,"Looks just like the pictures, you can tell it's not high quality by the feel of the fabric but it isn't see through and should hold up. Very pretty and elegant."
4.0,"I'd like them to fit more snugly, and be a little more shaping, but very comfortable."
4.0,"Fast shipment, my son loves them..."
4.0,Cute but a bit see through
4.0,"feels grea n, style nice"
4.0,"Bought for my wife. Watch itself is HUGE, way to big for her small wrist. Ended up giving it to a friend. If you are looking for a small ladies watch this is not the watch for you."
4.0,I love the way this shirt fits me! I cannot find many clothes that fit me right but this shirt does. I am so happy with the way the shirt fits! I would highly recommend this shirt for anyone whose looking for a simple shirt but still a little dressy.
4.0,I would've given it 5 stars because I've purchased these before since these earrings don't make my ear itch BUT the red ones came bent :( I was able to straighten them for the most part but still it wasn't what I was expecting. Will most likely repurchase in other colors in the future though!
4.0,"These are beautiful shoes and I would love to be able to wear them.  Unfortunately, the ankle strap is not adjustable and it was very loose on my ankle. As a result I could not walk in the shoes. They fit perfectly, and were very comfortable, but when I tried to walk in them they went out from under my feet due to the ankle strap not providing any security.  I'd buy them again in a heartbeat if the ankle strap had a buckle. Had to return them."
4.0,The bag is good but for my next order I will definitely order a larger size. This one is a nice bright color and everything is visible.
4.0,"Love finding quirky, fun, cat ties for my husband (he's a school teacher). Looks fantastic with a dress shirt and slacks for a more playful look and the kids love it. It's even brighter looking in person. Haven't washed it yet but this far, it's held up after a few wears."
4.0,"Not sure about the general protection, but my granddaughter loved it. It is cute and comfortable."
4.0,"It's pretty, looks like it came from Buckle and didn't have to spend as much money on it! It did smell a little strange (maybe from the plastic it was stored in) smell went away after hanging it up outside. I'm 5'5 15 lbs and bought a large. Fits great."
4.0,Very cute - perfect ti wear with T-shirts.
4.0,Little tip turn it inside out before you put it in the wash otherwise it'll get like these little lint dots on it
4.0,"Super Cute, Runs small though. My daughter loved it so I kept it anyway. She will get a few wears out of it, but looks like a good dress for pictures :)<br />Which is what I plan"
4.0,"I like the handbag. Sometimes, though, I feel I need a flashlight to find something at the bottom!"
4.0,Fit perfectly. Can't wait to wear it
4.0,"Great quality piece. Well constructed and good quality leather. Looks and feels great. Very reasonable price as well.<br />True to size, color is nice not to shiny...will go great with that black leather bomber jacket in your closet."
4.0,"I was looking to downsize my diaper bag to something cute, but not break the bank. This fits the bill. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I get nervous that the handles will start to tear when there’s a lot of stuff in it. Hasn’t yet, but I’m very cautious to not hold it by 1 handle.<br /><br />I didn’t love the patch on the front, so I removed it, no problems."
4.0,Wore this on Halloween with a grauation gown. People loved the necklace - so many compliments! Gavel and glasses were nice quality.
4.0,Very Nice!!!!!
4.0,Cute shorts great price. Wish they came in more colors!
4.0,LOVE BUT NOT ACCURATE SIZING
4.0,"Nice scarf, washed well in cold, line dry"
4.0,"Good quality gloves, though it was a little difficult to text with them on it was still possible. Mostly because the fingers are bigger than my own, but that's not the fault of the gloves. Look nice, I have a a 7.5 inch hand and was fine with a large, which is standard glove sizing."
4.0,True to size and good color.  Only wish the slit in the back wasn't so far down.  Harder for younger girls to wear to school with a bra strap showing.
4.0,the mask is comfortable soft and has the ability to slide in filter.<br />Love that I can slip off the ear loops and still maintain it on a soft lanyard when i don't need it.
4.0,I love love love it! The sizing is a little off. I got it a size bigger so that it would be loose on my finger and it still fit too snug I gave it to my niece
4.0,"Love it! Wish they came in different sizes, however. It barely stays on my itty-bitty wrists."
4.0,"For the price, I didn't expect much but it actually looks decent ."
4.0,Fantastic bra for martial arts and high impact. I'm a 36G. Only complaint is there are two closures and the upper one is a bit hard to get on my own. I'm lucky enough to have a husband who can help but on my own it would be weird.
4.0,The flower pattern needs to be stitched on better.  This should probably be taken to the cleaners or u will spend a lot of time ironing.  But very cute dress.
4.0,Good blause
4.0,The color in the photo of this item is not true. It orange and not red. The shirt comfort and design are good.
4.0,Little tite for for the size I purchased.  Fabric if thick and high quality.
4.0,My wife really like her infinity scarves.
4.0,"Ordered a size 18 based off the size chart, it was way too big, but I am able to get it altered for a reasonable price. I was blown away with the actual quality of the dress. It well surpassed my expectations, as it does not look cheap or poorly made. This is right up there with the dresses I looked at from David's Bridal but for a fraction of the price. 10/10 would recommend if you can wait several weeks for shipping."
4.0,"Light, not at all heavy and draggy.  Little smaller than I would've liked, kinda get lost in my hair, but I like the color, hasn't worn off so far, and I like the rough primitive style.  Overall very cute."
4.0,"I absolutely love the color and style of the dress! However their small, being someone who’s very petite (5’0 with Cs), I found it to be just slightly too big. I’m hoping a wash in the washer might fix it or shrink it a bit!<br />The quality is good for the price, it doesn’t feel cheap, and the material is nice."
4.0,"Nice stretchy and soft gloves. The only thing I wish was better is the sticking around the fingers, it’s a little snug (I’m a size 7 regular glove)"
4.0,"I am always looking for new blouses that are different looking.  I loved how this one looked and was excited to get it.<br /><br />The fabric is not very thick at all, which is nice and cool, but I had gotten another color (I got black) I don’t see how this would not be see through.  I love the style and how the arms are designed.  I am not sure it is worth the price point based on the thinness.  It is very comfortable and soft.<br /><br />I typically wear a 10/12 and got a 2XL because I don’t like tight shirts.  I am glad I got the larger size because it runs quite small.<br /><br />It washed really well, but I didn’t dry it.  I hung it up and it dried quickly and wasn’t wrinkled which was a nice bonus!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Love the dress. I'm top heavy, so the buttons would detach and expose my breast. Nothing a safety pin couldn't handle. I received compliments all day"
4.0,"Accidentally dropped them (I hadn't even worn them yet) and a large crystal on the temple broke off. I think my glue job will work (can't really tell, I think), but still bummed. Beautiful, unique and reasonably priced sunglasses. Just not sure how they are going to hold up in reality."
4.0,"Pros:<br />Light weight, pockets, true to picture, comfortable, did NOT shrink, versatile<br />Cons:<br />I had to sew/take in awkward arm holes, after 20ish wears and washes the color has faded some (totally got my money's worth)<br />About me:<br />5ft 4in, pregnancy weight 155, post pregnancy 118, chest 32D<br />Purchased an xs<br />This dress was perfect for my baby shower! It fit around my bump throughout my whole pregnancy and IT HAS POCKETS! The print is beautiful and the color is just as pictured. I can also wear the dress easily and it is still flattering after having my little one!"
4.0,"Soft material. Very comfy. Love the pockets. Only issue is if you are taller than 5’7, it’s a tad short."
4.0,"This is the second dress of this style that I've purchased. The color is beautiful, but the fit seems a little bigger than first dress like this that I purchased. I think it will shrink to the perfect size, if I put it in the dryer for a long time."
4.0,Nice suit.  Had to hem the slacks.
4.0,"Decent bras, and fit as expected. The pads inside are in a pocket so you can remove them. If you want to keep them, it takes a little maneuvering to adjust them again once you put it on. Then again, I may just be clumsy."
4.0,"Very soft, I sized up and i like the fit. Sleeves are a little weird as the only sewed them at one point to try to make it look rolled."
4.0,"I ordered shirt in 2 different colors, like the look, fit and feel"
4.0,nice but I had to return as is too small for what I wanted it for
4.0,"This is very pretty but it runs a bit snug when compared to similar items I have purchased on Amazon in this same size. The fabric is slightly thinner but it drapes well. I am large busted, 5'5&#34; and weigh 200 lbs."
4.0,Very cute and perfect for Sunday gathering or brunch. I ordered a small
4.0,"Soft warm, cozy"
4.0,Unfortunately they didn’t fit my face. But they were an excellent bold choice!
4.0,"I had been looking for a relatively cheap digital watch, preferably from Casio, as a simple watch to start the New Year off with. When I searched &#34;casio digital watch&#34; this was about the second product listing, so I knew it had to be a decent watch. I had worn it for a day or two and have since replaced it with the [insert link here]. Here is my review of the Casio F91W-1 and an explanation of why I replaced it.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Design & Build:<br />For just over $10, this Casio has great build quality and a cool retro design. In fact, the Casio F91W has been produced since 1991 and even has its own Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W) page! The design of the Casio is simple and classic and is probably one of the reasons why this watch is still successful after 25 years! The watch is very thin, - only 8 millimeters - especially for a digital watch, which is about the same thickness as an iPhone 5. The watch face is made of plastic and is not recessed into the body, meaning that while it is flush with the casing it can be scratched easily. The casing of the watch is made of resin which is pretty standard in most digital watches. The band is also made of resin and is comfortable enough for a $10 watch. One complaint that I have about the watches build quality is the material of which the band buckle is made of. The band buckle is made of ordinary black plastic which I can see breaking in a year or two. While I can't vouch for the longevity of this watch, I can almost confidently say that that plastic buckle will be the first part to break. Other than that, the watch features nice easy-to-press buttons which stick out from the watch a millimeter or two. The buttons are very easy to press, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing as they might be pressed accidentally. The top left button activates the display light which is very weak and only lights up from one side of the display, meaning that the left part of the display is kind of bright while the further you get to the right side of the display the light dims drastically. This seems like one of the areas Casio had to cut corners with in order to cut the cost, however, it is only a minor complaint with a $10 watch. The light shines a green light and only turns on while the button is depressed, which is kind of annoying. Digital watches I have owned in the past stayed on for a few seconds, but again, this is only a minor complaint with a $10 watch. Finally, the Casio features water RESISTANCE, not waterproofing, therefore I wouldn't go swimming with it, however, other users have reported diving with it so the decision is ultimately up to you. Overall, the Casio F91W features a simple and timeless design, as well as pretty good build quality for $10. The display light has some issues and the watch is only water resistant, but these things don't matter too much in a $10 watch.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Fit:<br />I have around a 6-inch wrist and this watch fit great. I used a hole more towards the end of the band away from the case and it fit comfortably while not being too loose. The watch is very light and once it is on you almost forget it is there. The case is also thin and doesn't add much bulk to your arm. For me, the watch face was a good size proportionate to my wrist. It might have been a little small for my liking but it definitely didn't get in the way. Overall, I am happy with how the F91W fit on my wrist.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Overall:<br />This watch is a great watch for the price. While I can't vouch for the longevity of this watch, I can say that it features a great design and decent build quality, as well as a good and comfortable fit (at least for my wrists). To conclude, if you have a bit over $10 to spend on a digital watch, you really can't go wrong with the Casio F91W.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />- Classic simple design<br />- Decent build quality<br />- Comfortable<br />- Thin and light<br />- Easy-to-press buttons<br />- Good fit for me<br />- Accurate time-keeping (Casio claims that the watch is accurate to ±30 seconds per month due to the quartz movement of the watch)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Weak plastic band buckle<br />- Easily scratched plastic face<br />- Weak and poorly designed display light<br />- Buttons may get accidentally pressed<br />- Only water resistant<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Why I Replaced it:<br />Even though the Casio F91W is a great watch for the money, I decided I wanted something a bit nicer, even if it meant spending a little bit more money. After browsing Amazon for other Casio watches, I came across the [[ASIN:B000AR7S3A G-Shock G100-BV Men's Black Resin Sport Watch]]. The reason why I replaced the F91W isn't because it isn't a good watch, instead, I replaced it because I wanted something a little nicer with a more rugged design. To conclude, I replaced the F91W not because it wasn't good, but because of personal preference.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />If you found this review helpful I would appreciate it if you clicked the &#34;helpful&#34; button below this review. Thanks!"
4.0,"The dress was very comfortable- easy fit  and sized true.  Received many compliments - a perfect look for Christmas Eve!  I purchased a SMALL - I am 5'2"" and weight 125lb."
4.0,They are narrower than the ones I tried on at the optometrist shop but they are beautiful glasses. I chose to keep them rather than try to return them. If you are going to order frames make sure you have all of the size information correct.
4.0,"Cute little loop for daily wearing, but I was having hard time to put them on since the pin part kind thick than regular studs and it cures. However a little bit Vaseline will help ."
4.0,Love the dress and the quality is superb. The only problem I had was the top was a little big but my handy sewing work took it up and then it was perfect!
4.0,We were looking for a pair like what we bought at Costco and these had the same material listed so thought they would be the same. Material feels different. Fit is still good and we'll keep them but not the exact ones we were looking for.
4.0,Actually large frame glasses!
4.0,"One of my favorite dress, wore it to a wedding, although it was skin tight the length on the sleeves and the length of the dress made it formal style."
4.0,Beautiful costume piece I bought for my mother In law and she was so happy with it. The stones were of color pictured and it sat very well on her neck at their anniversary dinner. Don't wear lace with it but otherwise great statement piece!
4.0,Love Baggalinni bags but wish this one were a bit roomier.  Not quite large enough to hold all my usual day trip needs.
4.0,Super cute black dress to wear with sandals or sneakers. Just need the warm weather!
4.0,"Got this after I accidentally sat on my last hat and crushed it. Haha! Figured it’s a small investment that will go a long way if you travel a lot and need a good way to protect your hat on the road.<br /><br />I guess I should have read the description a little closer because I thought it was made out of metal being called a “hat can” and all… but it’s actually made outa plastic. But, it seems sturdy enough and it is designed really well. I guess time will tell if it holds up.<br /><br />Hat in the photo is a Stetson “Open Road” for size comparison… as you can see, it’s plenty roomy for some larger brim/crown hats. You can get that adjuster dialed in and you can feel confident your hat isn’t going to bang around in there.<br /><br />Over all, looks like a solid product."
4.0,It is super cute but too small. I am a wide hipped size 12 female and this fit too small and the slit came up too high.
4.0,Nice only complaint is its a little itchy will try to wash with extra softner
4.0,"Glock owners unite! Tons of honks, compliments and 2nd Amendment shout outs whenever I wear this hat."
4.0,This is a decent product but if you have an extra large head it doesn’t fit as well did you like it’s a little too tight I wish they made ones for people with larger heads but it is Made well it seems like it can hold up for years with no problem it’s soft and durable took a long time to get probably because of the whole pandemic and shipping but once I got it it’s really nice just wish they made them in larger sizes
4.0,Charger works as is required. Wished it had its own AC plug in adapter though.
4.0,"This product is absolutely gorgeous. All the ears are great, and are comfortable, and my ears are small and sensitive. The crown however is incredibly uncomfortable. I wore it for 10 minutes and got a headache from wear the ends sit on my head. It squeezes, and made an indention on my forehead. I tried to bend it and rhinestones started falling out."
4.0,"This is pretty cool, good for a cool day or doing anything where you do not want to breath in dust.  I bought this just because it looks cool!  The mask is about as thin as a bandana and stretches a little."
4.0,Dress was just as anticipated and looked very nice
4.0,"I'm giving four stars because I was expecting these to be milestone belly stickers! What I actually got was actual cards, so it will be a little difficult to use them for pictures of my baby! They are however, very sturdy & thick so they won't bend easily so hopefully ill be able to figure out some way to take some good photos with them! They are extremely adorable and if you're a minnie mouse lover like we are, these are perfect!"
4.0,"These look cool! The wood looks nice, they don’t look cheap."
4.0,"I am so glad that I discovered this product; I am never going back to traditional belts! This is really helpful for if you have pants with different rise heights so you can easily adjust the belt to where the pants sit on your waist. Customer service was also very helpful with questions I had.<br /><br />Update: Broke after one year of use. Which for the price is not bad (-1 star), but I wished that it would have lasted longer. The ratchet mechanism on the inside snapped in half, I am not sure what kind of metal they are using but they need something stronger."
4.0,I like these shoe's there cute and I can easily tuck in my pants leg.
4.0,"Like the style,color and length.  Did not like the fact that these did not come in larger size.  I had mine altered in the side to enlarge the waist.  I ordered these for my senior dance group.  We performed a line dance on stage."
4.0,I loved the way it looked and I could get in on and zipped but if I wanted to eat that wasn't going to happen.  Half of the reviews said true to size and half said it ran small so I took a chance and ordered my normal size.  Unfortunately I had to return it.
4.0,Product is good but at the same time when is doesn’t fit for you no use how good it is
4.0,It’s great for an after bath robe. It’s not thick like a housecoat is so don’t confuse the two
4.0,For the price its nice and doesmt feel flimsy
4.0,The scarf is nice.  The scarf does have a baby blue color undertone.
4.0,"So far I love these socks, the thickness is good for every day. But I would prefer a little thicker for some hiking in colder weather. Hopefully they will hold up good."
4.0,Flexible and easy to replace on existing band.
4.0,i like them but kinda disappointed cuz i didnt get all that were pictured like bat man spiderman an the alien an animal prints :(
4.0,"Thin material,  but pretty!"
4.0,Great material and quality. I have a petite frame so the small was a little large for me.
4.0,took a long time to get here but was worth it &lt;3
4.0,Very cool glasses!! Just too heavy
4.0,Overall I loved the skirt! Waist was tight but I have a small torso so it worked. Used it as a high waist skirt
4.0,"I loved everything about these shoes. My only concerns are that they fit a size, to a size and a half too small and need to be broken in.<br />The color, quality and style are great! They also don’t make my feet look bulky like other brands. Thanks!"
4.0,This is a very comfortable skort. It stays cool in the humid southern heat. The under shorts have a pocket on the hip. The only drawback is that the skirt has to be lifted up to access the pockets.
4.0,Good idea and pretty well made.  The problem is that it is hard to locate the hole to put a bottle in when you are wearing the mask.
4.0,Serve the function to keep warm when it is not very cold
4.0,Sized better they look and work great though they do not stretch very well to tight new to have various sizes. They are smaller than you may have used in the past.
4.0,"The Gawian Pendant in person is very beautiful with minor human error craftsmanship, e.g off center golden orbs that separate the names around the pendant. Still beautiful. IT IS SMALLER than it looks on the screen and other images if you search it. Its also lighter than it looks. I wasnt looking for a clunky piece of jewlery but over-viewing the product you would expect it to be just a little bit heavier than what it actually is. I still love it though. I'll give it 4 1/2 stars only because i was expecting a much heavier peice. Still lovely to marvel at and wear and it is big enough to know what it is at first glance so people arent squinting or wondering what is around your neck."
4.0,Rings were nice but beware they run small!
4.0,It was a pretty nice top. Good price. Looks a lot like picture. It was just way too big for me.
4.0,"I like this kit overall, but I don’t like the black coating on the outside. It caused irritation in my ear."
4.0,Fit and quality as expected. Pretty.
4.0,The dress is well made and true to the colour and texture as seen.  Lovely dress.
4.0,Like the top.  Very soft.  However it does run a little small.  Ordered my normal size but it was a little small.  I should have ordered the next size up.
4.0,These earrings are so tiny I thought they were nose rings at first! I might even have nose rings that are bigger than these! Other than that they look like just like the picture and arrived a week early.
4.0,"The wallet looked really good, and it was made great, but the vinyl sleeves, I believe would tear, just the way my past vinyl sleeves, have done. Removing your cards in and out constantly over time, and the sleeves will tear..."
4.0,"I love this mask for my God-daughter who tends to fit in 4T clothes.  At first look, it seems like this fits great, but in practice it rides up to her eyes if I push it up too much to fit over her nose and often slips down when she talks, exposing her nose.  It's a constant battle.<br /><br />I'm going to try the next size up because I think it's a matter of it being too small to accommodate her constantly moving mouth.  I'm ordering the adult one's for my older children and myself since they seem so nice.<br /><br />As an aside, I discovered that these really should be hand washed if you want to preserve the color.  The first wash in the delicates bag was fine, but the second took away the vibrant yellow.  Live and learn."
4.0,"I really wanted to love this skirt but sadly it was to short for me.  I am 5'7"" (size 4/6) and it hit me a bit above my fingertips.  The other black & white check skirt (w/o the side bow) was a much better length.  Both skirts are lightweight cotton but not see-through."
4.0,Nice but too heavy
4.0,Love this product!  Keeps my laptop case organized.  I can find everything in a minute and not have to dig through all the pockets and junk!
4.0,Very nice quality and fit for the price
4.0,"I ordered size Large to wear to church. The dress fits ok, apart from the neckline, which is a bit too wide. I will have to make adjustment to make it fit better. A smaller size would not fit."
4.0,Ok great.
4.0,My daughter loved it but I wish it came in bigger sizes...had to send back. She is theoretically a 32B but this was way small cup size. so pretty though!
4.0,"This is a great bag, but a little larger than I wanted. Just be aware that it is truly a brief size messenger bag...can fit a laptop and then some. It is a bit masculine as well, but I personally like that rugged look. I stopped using it for awhile, but just recently brought it back out. It really is a good looking bag....and draws compliments. Better yet, the men in the household can use it as well."
4.0,"It fits together like a ""spring rod"" (think window curtains and shower rods). I had no problem putting it together or using it. I'd give it 5 stars, but I reserve that for amazing products. This one is merely awesome."
4.0,SUPER CUTE. WOULD TOTALLY BUY AGAIN. JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M SURE AFTER A WASH AND DRY THEY WILL SHRINK A LITTLE TO FIT.
4.0,I use them for work.  TO keep my hair covered while caring for sick patient.  My mother loves them as -- she is hormonal and finds the wicking of sweat great.
4.0,Nice. Attractive.
4.0,Straps were a little too long on all 3 dresses I ordered but the quality is really good and I'm guessing it won't be too hard to alter them as there is a seam on top of the straps.
4.0,Super cute dress...fit me a bit small around the butt area.
4.0,great product and item.  I would reorder.
4.0,Good fit. Like all hats takes some breaking in.
4.0,It is good was for my cousin.
4.0,I guess I anticipated the size would be smaller. It was too big for my little cousin. Good product though.
4.0,"I ordered this as a toss-in-the-car-just-in-case jacket. I wasn't expecting much, just a jacket that would be fine if I were unexpectedly caught in the rain or as a quick loaner to an under equipped friend. I'm pleasantly surprised because it is warmer and more substantial then expected. I think it would be fine for temperatures a bit below freezing.<br /><br />The seams are fine and the stitching is not wonky. The outer shell is nicely water repellant and the inner liner is warm. The inner liner is some kind of fake fur, an interesting choice but it does get the job done. I'd be glad to have this jacket if I were faced with a long walk in the rain or snow. Well, I'd be glad if I didn't have my north face jacket around.<br /><br />Getting picky about things, bigger pockets and more pockets would be nice. Especially the inside pocket which is kind of small and is just sewn in over the liner. It would be nice to have three or four inside pockets and even nicer if the pockets were between the shell and liner. The hood is connected by a zipper, but the jacket seems to lack a place to keep it once it's off. Finally - its fit is larger than expected."
4.0,Suprisingly excellent lens in a cheap pair of sun glasses. They are comfortable as well
4.0,"This jacket runs true to size and is super cute.  The most surprising thing is this jacket is not made of jean material.  It is a soft fabric.  I am so use to this style being jean material, so this is new to me."
4.0,Lovely night gown. I just needed to order a smaller size.
4.0,"Cute, but a little smaller than I thought it would be. Still a useful bag for games and concerts."
4.0,"I really like the way this shapes my torso. It would be five stars, except one of the bones is already coming out after only wearing it three times."
4.0,"Good quality for the price, my baby loves them and hasn’t broken them yet. Too bad I ordered the set that said one was black and one was yellow/blue and we received a pink and a black."
4.0,Cómodas.. aunque poco durables
4.0,Appears to be a good product.  Directions would have been helpful.
4.0,I loved this costume ran a little small  I would recommend  going a size bigger for more comfort .....and the white is a little transparent  so I wore some shorts  under  beside that it was a great fun costume
4.0,I like it. The ring it’s on is a little thick and hard to attach but we figured it out. Overall love this product
4.0,It's a Nice top just kinda small on the bottom still love it
4.0,"I purchased the Heroecol Women's Vintage 1950's Cross V Neck dress in a small and it fit perfect.  Love this dress.  I purchased the Oblong Neck dress in the same size however it was too small.  I will be returning the dress and I'm not certain if I'll exchange it for a Medium.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 125 lbs, unlike the V Neck style I'll need to make several alterations to get the dress to look good on my frame.  The skirt drops about 3.5&#34; below my knee and the sleeves drop an inch below the elbow (small size).  That aside the dress is very flattering. I purchased the dress and the shade is wonderful, a deep rich red and the fabric quality is very nice.  Although this wasn't as perfect as the Cross V dress I will certainly be purchasing another dress style from Heroecol."
4.0,Got these inexpensively with a promo code.  They fit true to size and were great sneakers for my 1 year old.
4.0,"Nice hoodie for the price, wristbands are little tight."
4.0,I really like this dress. just a bit see thru....
4.0,"With Athleta and Old Navy leggings, I typically take a large (I wear a size 8-10 in pants).  Ordered a large in these and they were too small.  Daughter wears a medium (6-8) and these fit her perfect.  She loves the fit, the pocket, material, etc.  Great pant but sizing is off and I would order a size larger."
4.0,"This watch works fine, I’m just not that crazy about the hour hand. That triangular shaped end just looks strange to me… And the date numbers are so small also… They look like an after thought.,"
4.0,"My 7-yr old wears size 8 leggings in Old Navy for the length. I like her leggings to completely cover her ankles and not ride up a lot when she sits.  I tried the 8-9 and they’re perfect. She can fit into the 6-7, but the leggings just reach her ankles exactly.<br /><br />The 8-9 leggings are perfect length and length-wise should be good for the school year. The skirt is fairly short so I’m glad I got the bigger size so it comes down a little more.  Didn’t give 5 stars because there were a few loose threads after washing. Hopefully these will hold up though!"
4.0,"This is a really well-made skirt.  The fabric is thick and high-quality.  Unfortunately, this skirt didn't fit me.  I purchased a medium and it was snug  around waist and hips for me.  I am pear-shaped with ample thighs, butt, and hips.  I decided to not to go up a size, since I felt that it wouldn't as flattering on me."
4.0,"As other reviewers stated, the back way too large, so I had to take it in."
4.0,"With the lack of reviews (only 2 before purchase) and obviously nor being the official replica jersey from Nike, I did have my doubts. For fitting, it is true to size but for myself I had gained a little weight so I'm usually XXL and I barely fit but I'll start working out again now that the world is opening up from the pandemic. Stitching looks very professional no loose threads or anything looking to rip easily. Obviously fair price because Nike really charges a lot for it. Only 4 stars because minor details of leaving out the Nike and Lebron logo but better than the original because the name James is on the back. Overall, definitely worth it for a cheaper usable Space Jam Lebron jersey and I wore it to the theaters with my friends and they all loved it."
4.0,"These are really nice gloves and I wish they had been a bit more true to size. I bought a small for my mother who has very petite hands and fingers were still too long. So if someone has an average sized small hand, they will work fine but much smaller hands probably will not. Otherwise, great product."
4.0,"Overall great value for the money. The earrings are light enough for long wear. My only issue is that the red earrings will twist while wearing showing the felt at the back, I wished that the back was beaded as well. But there are all generally well made."
4.0,Has lots of card pockets which I really needed. You can tell it's fake leather but it's fine. It was only $12 so I can't complain.
4.0,Really well made.
4.0,"I like this and I’ll keep it but I thought it was fleece, it’s not. It’s more like a dry-fit type of fabric."
4.0,"Cute and comfortable, but slightly more narrow than I like."
4.0,its a well made bag just a bit excpensive for what I think its more 40 not 60=+
4.0,It's nice but very wrinkly. Dry clean before wearing
4.0,Ordered a 1x based on the reviews and it fits great. I'm usually a 14 or XL @ 5'6 and DDD bust. This top is loose but flattering at the same time. It comes to right about my hips. I love the fabric! Very light weight
4.0,"Got this for a friend, she loves it, as for myself, I think it is a little wild or strange looking. But that's just me."
4.0,Bought this for my Great neice.  She loved it!!<br />Nice little thin dress for the summer.
4.0,These are great socks and fit my 9 year old dd perfectly. Bought the white with three black stripes. Nice quality & fit. Bought for a Halloween costume and I'm glad I ordered in advance because they take a while to arrive. I wasn't paying attention when I ordered but note that they are shipped from China
4.0,My girlfriend loves this outfit
4.0,Looks great and is decent quality. Would give 5 star if the stitching wasn’t very thin and coming loose after only a few uses
4.0,"Got them for my wife, she love them."
4.0,"Liked the color, love the style"
4.0,"My new favorite accessory! I wore them out Last night for the first time and I loved everything about them, except they were just a wee bit loose so they kept sliding down my nose, but other than that, I actually considered going ahead and ordering a couple more, in case they get lost or broken!"
4.0,Seems a little tight to me.  I’m going to iron it to stretch it out just a little.
4.0,"I'm 4'11"" and about 124lbs curvy figure. The Medium size fit great. I could've gone smaller but I wanted good coverage of the bottom. It's cute and sexy w/out being vulgar. It's great for water parks w/kiddos. I haven't used it yet but I don't think I'll have any problems w/it. I wish the material was a bit thicker and I don't think I'll be putting it in the dryer to keep it as dark as possible for as long as I  can. Due to the material and weird placement and a bit awkward shaped cups I'm giving it 4 stars. However, for $12.99 IT'S PERFECT!"
4.0,"I will reiterate what many others have said in their reviews here.  The knee pads are a little low.  They should be at least a full inch higher for me.  However, when in the sitting position with the knees bent, they do come up just enough to barely cover the knee cap.  The concern here is if I am in a crash where my leg straightens out, my knee may not be protected.<br /><br />I ordered my normal size of a 30"" waist.  They do feel a tiny bit tight, but it's not so tight to where I will send them back for an exchange.  Ordering one size bigger would feel more comfortable.<br /><br />If it weren't for the knee pad placement issue, I would have given this 5 stars and ordered two more pair, considering the value for the price ($59 when I ordered).  However, I'll try these out for a couple weeks."
4.0,I loved this jacket. It fits as expected ( i'M a size S 34B). If you like jackets a bit bulky then you should go a size above but if you like them fitted to the body your regular size should be Ok
4.0,"Nice craftsmanship. I only wish it had come on a cardboard/foam display instead of in a baggie, for gift-giving purposes. Nothing says high-quality like getting jewelry in a ziploc."
4.0,"Based on other reviews I ordered 2 sizes up, and while I can get into it, it is a bit snug across the bust area, and the sleeves are very very tight below the elbow. I'm going to try to let the cuff part out or alter it, but I certainly didn't expect fit problems when I ordered up 2 sizes.  It's very pretty and I really do like it which is why I'm keeping it and trying to alter it, but be careful of the manufacturer- I have no idea who the sizing is based on."
4.0,"Great price, was a good gag gift."
4.0,"I love these earring because they will not randomly come off when I dry my hair with a towel.  They are a bit thicker than I would have liked, but they are not that heavy, so I can compromise."
4.0,Sooo cute! Buying in another color..
4.0,Love it waiting on the remaining  charms
4.0,Easy to tie dye and fun to do with a kid
4.0,"This looked a little frumpy on me. The material is soft, and it was a good color, but if I wanted to keep it, I would have to go down a size."
4.0,"The dress was lovely, the fabric soft & not prone to wrinkle.. The fit was good, the length perfect, the color exactly as pictured. I measured between sizes & sized up to M. For reference, 5'5"" 114#, 34 bust.<br /> I returned because I looked frumpy in it."
4.0,Tal como se ve en la imagen
4.0,I like how they make my legs feel all day and at the gym. However I will get a lager size next time
4.0,"Love the color & style. It's cool for summer wear, easy to wear, and while my shoulder was out of commission, button down was so much better than pullovers while dressing.  It would be perfect, except it's not wrinkle free. I don't iron it anyway, since it's sort of crinkly and I use it mostly around the house & after wearing it awhile, the crinkles settle down a little."
4.0,QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD
4.0,"The luggage was exactly what we needed and expected. Sturdy, yet light weight. Very happy with my choice."
4.0,"soft, pliable. Fits the Luminox watches"
4.0,"THIS IS HANDS DOWN MY MOST FAVORITE HAT EVER OWNED. EVER. THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT, IS THAT IT'S A BIT LOOSE, AND BEING AS IT'S SO AWESOMELY CONSUMING OF MY HEAD, IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP IN PLACE. BUT OVERALL, I LOVE IT AND CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR IT THIS WINTER!"
4.0,Fits perfectly. I got it in a small. I love the way it hugs my curves. The material isnt too heavy.
4.0,Way way long in the finger. I have small hands and ordered sm/med and the actually fit my husband
4.0,Nice fit but very thin material. Will see how it lasts
4.0,Classic Ivy. First hat sent was wrong size bag said Large Hat was Medium daaaa. Bag was not factory sealed so the dealer had to made the mistake.  Easy mistake....that can be easily avoided. That is the reason for 4 star and not 5. Got the correct size hat and it is very nice.
4.0,"I used this strap on my Bell and Ross BR123 Phantom.  It looks great.  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because there was an imperfection in the color of the leather.  It looks like the dye got smeared.  It is under the buckle, so it's not noticeable while wearing the watch, btu I thought it was worth mentioning."
4.0,"I had seen multiple posts on various sites where people had de-potted their lipsticks and then popped them in the oven on a VERY low heat and voila!  Lipstick organization heaven.  Well, after de-potting 4 lipsticks, using the oven method as low as I could possibly get it, and even a hairdryer, the plastic warped as the lipstick melted, and now I can't get them to screw into one another.  If this is your sole purpose for buying these, just be aware, the plastic is quite thin and just not suited for this.  Fortunately, I have a million other things I can use them for (rhinestones, etc;) and the little plastic case has a sturdy latch and they were otherwise good.  I think this product was a bit on the pricey side as compared to some of the others offered here on amazon..."
4.0,Grandson liked it....
4.0,Made my ears bleed and gave me an infection the 3rd day of wearing them
4.0,Snoozies are great
4.0,"This is thin and shows every bump/line. But it was great for sleeping in and around the house. Not sure I believe the 100% part, it felt more like a blend. But I loved the color and it feels nice on in the heat."
4.0,Comfy and feels like they will hold up well. The pattern and description does not match. I ordered a floral pattern but received Christmas pattern.
4.0,"Fit wasn't what I hoped for. Way too wide and way too short it didn't fit me well and looked like a cube. Also, the sleeves didn't have the fold up rolls like pictured."
4.0,"It fit perfectly, however the strips did not match up at the side seams and I didn't care for that."
4.0,A shoe for both feet is blasphemy!!!!!!
4.0,ok didnot use them much yeat
4.0,These are a must have if you’re doing baby led weaning. It’s easy to take these on and off and wipe them down. I use it multiple times a day for my 1 yo so it’s nice to have a few spares. I love the prints too.<br /><br />Update: these did not last. The elastic around the wrist started to detach only a few months in. The inner lining is also flaking off. Definitely do NOT put these in the washer.
4.0,"I got it cause it had a good amount for a reasonable price. When it came, it was packaged in bubble wrap to keep it safe. The earrings are sturdy and true to the picture. One thing that gets me is the little black spots on the star earrings. Other than that, nice earrings. C: I might buy them again for a friend this time!"
4.0,It is a cute dress however the material is thin and it expose EVERYTHING lol
4.0,"This bag was sturdy enough to get through 3 weeks as my secondary/ carry-on bag while traveling throughout Europe. Love it! Only 2 issues: the opening could be a little wider and, for me, is the strap is a little long, as I am a petite person."
4.0,Love these plugs but the shipping price was kind of high.
4.0,"I have been looking for this lounge set for two weeks in my home; which made no sense because I keep everything organized and put my clothes away from the dryer. Tonight I got in my dresser to get a pair of shorts and found the shorts. They’re a heavy material, like sweatpants. They’re definitely shorter and more fitted than other pajama shorts in my size. I decided to search my closet and dresser to find the top.<br /><br />I had hung it with my work sweaters, that’s how thick this material is. The top is definitely much smaller than typical extra large ones and way to fitted to be comfortable. It’s also much too warm for me to sleep in, even in the winter. I ordered my normal size so I’d recommend ordering a size up if you want it looser."
4.0,Be wary of color white! The pocket linings show thru but the rest looks see-thru even though it isn't! No complaints other colors.
4.0,"A little on the see-through side, but comfortable."
4.0,I would definitely size up at least one size. I am usually a medium and this fits perfectly to allow for layers under for hunting in the cold weather. Not much padding in the shoulder for shooting.
4.0,Very comfortable for lounging!  Just what I expected.
4.0,"These bracelets are beautiful:  minimally blemished with each pearl uniquely different.  The bracelets each measured 7 inches in length and the pearls were 7-8mm.  They were the perfect fit for my child-sized 5.75 inch wrists.  However as the bracelets slid up and down my arm they caught and tugged on the tiny hairs on my wrists, which was maddeningly uncomfortable.  So back they went.  The return was easy.<br /><br />Addendum:  Some months later I realized I wanted to primarily wear stacked pearl bracelets with opera gloves and reordered these.  They glide over the gloves and slide gracefully as I dance or gesture with my hands.  Because they are elastic rather than clasped, they are easy to slip off when removing gloves and easy to slip on with gloved fingers.  They're simply the perfect accessory with Opera gloves!"
4.0,I bought this set more for the colors than the style. I was pleasantly surprised by the soft material. Comfortable fit.
4.0,Great value & cool looks!
4.0,I absolutely loved this but lost it as it fell out after a few days! Just make sure you check it’s secured.
4.0,My daughter loved this. The material is good quality and so far has washed very well. It was a little smaller than I was anticipating but still fit fine.
4.0,My son loves these shoes. Size up
4.0,"Pretty great sunglasses, look great, feel great, my only complaint is the lenses are very cheap plastic-like material, thus scratch easier and are harder to clean. I'd be happy to buy again if they ever update the lens material."
4.0,I am pleasantly happy with this!  It’s a little roomier than I expected (and I followed their size chart) but not too bad.  The fabric is flexible which is nice for movement.  Very excited to wear this to a Christmas party’
4.0,"Nice, accurate watch.  As other reviewers have written, this watch is a great fit for thinner wrists.  Normally I need to buckle a watch to the tightest or second-tightest hole.  With this watch, I can comfortably buckle to the fifth-tightest hole (of twelve).  I wouldn't think too many people have much smaller wrists than mine, but if you do, this is your watch!  Back light is useless; I could not read the time at all.  Hence, four stars."
4.0,great fit - well made
4.0,"I received this band yesterday (paid for by me) so this is just first impressions from wearing for a few hours.  So far it's more comfortable than the band which came with the Blaze.  No pinching myself trying to get this band on like the original Blaze band.  Getting the pins in was a bit tricky, but they are secure.  I was worried because it seemed like the pin wasn't in all of the way, but I've pulled and twisted the band and it seems to be in place.  I'll come back and update this review after wearing for a few more weeks."
4.0,Awesome tank.  Funny and comfortable.  Wear it to the beach and the gym. Will be purchasing more from them
4.0,A simple yet fancy watch for the practical watch wearer.  A little smaller than imagined though.
4.0,Muy boniti. Un poco grande.
4.0,"feminine and cute that will definitely catch the eye without being too ""busy"".  I removed the long straight chain to keep it more simple"
4.0,The men's shirt was spot on.  But the woman's was quite a bit smaller than it should have been.
4.0,"This kimono is very pleasing to the eye and can work with any outfit, although it's a bit on the larger size so you may feel like you're drowning in it. The fabric is nice to touch and to have on your skin, and perfect to wear for a spring type day or at the pool/beach or even indoors. Also the price is very reasonable.<br /><br />Katiebabs"
4.0,Like the ring..to bad it doesn't fit.
4.0,"Love them, they're just as they appear. They don't touch the bottom portion of my eyes on my face like some glasses do."
4.0,Its bigger than what i expected but still cute and holds a lot of stuff
4.0,"A little longer than I expected. Not the greatest fabric, but cute."
4.0,The face picture of dog is cute but a little hard to read time.  Band was on backwards but easy fix
4.0,"When I received it, to me it didn't look like the normal afghan hats they wear in the east; it seemed a little too fluffy/large.  However, the ladies dig it, and it's not bad quality.  It truly keeps a man's ears and face warm in the winter, and it hasn't come apart on me yet!"
4.0,"I could have used this dress to  be a ""Midi"" length as it was too long for someone 5'51/2"""
4.0,"True to other reviews, the black one was NOT the dame size. I will have to buy and extender in order to wear that one. the gray and white are perfect and very comfortable..."
4.0,Very comfortable and holds the shape without the underwire.
4.0,"Flimsy but perfect and cost effective for a one time use. The Minnie ears were useable -- not floppy like I read in previous reviews, and they fit my daughters head too. The back has small Velcro pieces so it isn't ideal for multiple uses unless you can reinforce the back. My daughter is 3yo: 32lbs; 38.5in height; 47cm head. She fits in the 3/4T. Four stars only bc it will likely can not be used again."
4.0,Tanzanite stones' color is probably 35-40% of what is pictured here.
4.0,"Very comfortable, but runs a bit small. I love these shirts though!"
4.0,"I ordered 2 shirts (1 small and 1 medium for a gift), they were both the exact same size when I laid them on a table.  The small was larger than typical small for me, but I am afraid the medium will be too small for her.  Shirt is soft."
4.0,Was bought for someone else. I think they like it
4.0,Beautiful ring but very petite.<br />Lots of shine though.
4.0,They're nice but sadly they do roll down a lot when they're pulled up past my knees.
4.0,The item works great I only gave it four stars because the strap can rub against your leg a bit but otherwise it works fine.
4.0,I really like the material of this shirt. The print is starting to peel which is disappointing. I would recommend hang drying to help it last longer.
4.0,Good for a joke is about it
4.0,"I ordered an XL after reading reviews, should have gone with the L (I am typically a medium)  The bottoms are tiny, but the suit is super cute and of decent quality."
4.0,Really Nice Bathing Suit
4.0,I like it but it has lining in it which makes it super warm. It wasn't cold enough to wear last winter. Not like I want more snow! :-P
4.0,Happy with the quality but runs a little small...need to lay of the pizza or I'll be needing the next size up
4.0,"For the price, it was a great purchase. Knowing that the necklaces were coming from overseas, I was very happy to receive them in less than 10 days. The necklaces are nothing short than costume jewelry, so do not expect excellent quality."
4.0,I'm 5'2 115 lbs. I bought the tan in small. It was a tad small. I wore it but would've been more comfortable in a size up. Also the color is a little too orange.
4.0,"You'll have to wear them out a bit for then to be perfect, but it feels and looks amazing on my fossil sport."
4.0,"Super cute slippers, run just a bit on the small side, but overall very happy with purchase.  My son really likes."
4.0,Love this blouse dress wore with leather leggings was awesome 😎
4.0,"Somewhat more tan than I expected, but still a good fit."
4.0,Love them. Subtracted one star because one of them was difficult to open and close - it's not aligned properly.
4.0,Ordered these but receive plain ones without gems. Would fix if we had time but they will work just fine.
4.0,"I adore these pajamas. They are super soft and so comfy. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars however, b/c the waistband tie is basically just a satin ribbon and it came untied while I was sleeping. It isn't sewn in anywhere, so it completely came out, and I cannot feed it back through. Still, these are my favorite pajamas. I'd order more if they fix the waistband issue..I'd actually prefer no waist tie at all, the elastic is more than enough to keep them around your waist. I now have the 2 little holes on the waist where the tie used to be."
4.0,"Pretty. However, background is not as teal as in picture. More greenish."
4.0,"This does what it's supposed to, and that's great.. but it seems to run a little small.  Or maybe it's supposed to be super snug. I don't know.  But, I had a very low back dress, no bra showing, and no awkward bulges from the strap.  I did need to play with the strap/keep shifting it to be sure it pulled my bra out of sight.  But, once I found that strap placement, it stayed in place all night.  :)"
4.0,"This is such a bright and fun sundress. The material has a little bit of stretch to it, which makes it very flattering while keeping it comfortable. The pattern and colors are fun and perfect for summer days at the beach or picnics.<br /><br />It loses one star for being hand-wash only."
4.0,I liked the bathing suit. It fit well. The top didn’t sit as well as I hoped but I’m 6ft so that could be the case.
4.0,I love this dress!!! It's prefect to wear to school and super comfortable! I'm 5'6&#34; and it falls right above my knees.
4.0,My son loves it but I think it is too snug.
4.0,"Purchased these compression socks for long flights. They are, like all of the type, a challenge to get on, but do the job very well."
4.0,She loved them but complained that they were pretty snug.
4.0,I love the owl!
4.0,Debated this dress for a while and grateful I finally did. The dress was lovely and fit as expected. I washed on cold and hung dry so did not have any shrinking issues. Great summer dress!
4.0,This material is smooth and comfortable.  Size is true as stated. Fits comfortable and very vibrant
4.0,Color selection could be better.
4.0,Fits well.  Cute top!
4.0,I've got big hips and it stretches across them a bit. If the hips in the dress were a bit fuller it would be a perfect dress.
4.0,the size is adjustable. these don't fold easily so are a little bulky but are very warm and just what I wanted.
4.0,"The Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Crewneck delivers on all fronts.  It seems to be a well-made, quality sweatshirt....comparable to more expensive alternatives. It is comfortable to wear and has a nice appearance.  All in all I am very pleased at the good value that Russell has delivered."
4.0,The waist is super high. Comfy
4.0,I got these for my 10 year old son.<br />I wanted to find something that was both comfortable and stylish and these fit him perfectly.  Right away he noticed the ease of looking at his ipad.
4.0,It's beautiful!  The color was a little darker than pictured.  But it's still has a very nice quality.
4.0,Amazing but the large is really snug. I'm 5 foot 10 and weight is 155. It may just be too snug but still a bad ass shirt. Maybe an extra large but that may be a tad too big so idk
4.0,Came with a piece broken off but its super cute!
4.0,This is a very warm jacket I really like it the only thing is it runs a little small I normally wear a large and should have ordered an extra large
4.0,I really like this. It look even better in person!  The only thing that could improve this product is if it had also been a purse hook.
4.0,An inexpensive and needed addition to your luggage.
4.0,"Theses are a little tricky to get placed on ear but once there, they do stay on snugly without causing any discomfort. Very simple silver hoops, but they work and are great option for my daughter who does not have pierced ears."
4.0,Great look for bulky style.
4.0,"Planned to have my 2 month old wear for fall pictures, but the onesie and pants are WAY too big! I would compare the 0-3 month size to 6-9 months. 2nd picture is what a standard 0-3 month size is. Besides from the size, the outfit itself is super adorable and good quality. I can’t wait until my baby girl actually fits into it!!"
4.0,It's a nice warm sweater but the arms were a tad short.  They didn't come down to the wrists which I would have preferred.  The sweater looks nice with jeans.
4.0,"I'll admit I am having a horrible time with the whole face mask thing.  Maybe I was smothered as a child, I don't know... but for my whole life I have absolutely abhorred having anything against my face.  I don't even want a scarf against my face when I work outside in the freezing cold, dead of winter.<br /><br />So now since COVID-19 is a thing, and I have to succumb to wearing a face mask/covering to go anywhere,  I've been really scrambling to find something that I can tolerate that blends style with conforming.  I chose this one because it not only looks like a bandanna, which I like, but it has ear loops to help keep it in place.  Plus, plus, right?<br /><br />This was sort of a test purchase, because I see many of these in really cool prints that I would have purchased, had this one worked out.<br /><br />The fabric is very slinky.  I found that every breath I drew also pulled the fabric in and created a kind of stifling, suffocation type experience while attempting to walk, talk and breathe with fabric invading my nostrils and eventually my open mouth as I started to get a little desperate (real or imagined) for oxygen.  Air did come through, but not nearly the volume one anticipates without resistance,  and while I was trying to talk to my friend while we walked, I found myself mouth breathing with a sharp edge of panic building up as the fabric continued to pull in with the air, until I couldn't take it any more and just removed it.<br /><br />I think that if I were to wear this again, it would be just for style, to cover up an firmer, uglier type mask that I could breathe through such as the N95 type masks, if they ever become available again.  Something to keep the fabric at bay but allow air to come in.  I also do not think the thin, slinky fabric would do much for keeping the sickness away from me or away from others if, God forbid, I had it."
4.0,Awesome socks great detail they are one size fits all but if you have really big feet my partner is size 13 and they are really tight on him other then that they are great!
4.0,"Adorable, but runs small."
4.0,Works great to have my daughter ride with me. Makes it easier for her to hold on rather then my belt. Does get a little hot wearing it but does what it's supposed to
4.0,"I thought the color was grey, but it's more blue.  I wish it were more grey."
4.0,I like the feel of the shorts and the length. I didn't like the elastic waist so I removed it. I like them much more without the elastic and I can still tie them.
4.0,Needed to sand them down a bit to make them fit.
4.0,I had a top in mind when I bought this skirt. The top from another mfg. looks good with this skirt. I like to wear the skirt with a crinoline to keep it looking full. Your tastes may differ.
4.0,"Hat is warm and comfortable, only slight draw back is the one size. It's slightly big on my head and needs adjusting often. Otherwise nice hat"
4.0,Long Sleeves are way to short .<br />I re-ordered Large Size hoping the Sleeves would be longer. The Sleeves were still too short . I have average length arms . I kept the Large Size Shirts because I like the look and comfort.I will have to pull the sleeves<br />Up over my elbows . Can't handle sleeves that are too short. I do like the design .
4.0,"I got size small 2-3 years old, my daughter is almost 3 but she's a petite child so it was large on her! The arms was to long and  around her neckline was loose , but it held well underneath her Halloween costume!"
4.0,Cute top. Nice fabric. I ordered one size up and I'm glad I did because it fits perfectly.
4.0,Shorts fit. Comfortable and very very affordable
4.0,"These were some of the cheapest sandals I could find on Amazon. I don't know why anybody would pay so much for something a kid is only going to wear for about two months. But, for $15 these seem to be great quality, I'm sure they'll last far past when my kid outgrows them. I'm very happy with them, the fit is good and true to size. The soles are hard and sturdy for rugged players. The material is strong and stitching seems well done."
4.0,"I've worn this mask twice for parties.  It fits pretty well, it slides a bit down the nose if not tied tightly in the back.  Overall it fit well, seems durable, looks nice for what it is.  It is all one piece, the ornament around the edge is a rubbery plastic painted silver.  So this is not a ""deluxe"" mask but it gets the job done and looks good from a distance."
4.0,Very nice and sweet. really like it.
4.0,"looks good, hangs nice."
4.0,"Watch is as pictured. It is a cheap watch, but that's what I was expecting, so I am not disappointed. It's exactly what you'd expect for a $15 watch. The face is a brushed light gold metal. Note, the inner seconds trackers (3 circles) do not move. They're just decoration. The band says &#34;genuine leather&#34;, but I doubt it is. You can actually see the glue on one of the band holders (see picture). Again, it's what I would expect for the price. If you're looking for something cheap to wear here-and-there, then I would recommend this watch. Definitely not bashing it. I am picky about my watches, but wanted to buy a white one to see how much I would actually wear it before I spent $100+. This watch is perfect for that purpose."
4.0,ok shirt
4.0,These Aldens are a benefit to me. I was able to adjust the optics successfully. I did note that there is a hard stop so one should adjust them slowly. My vision is near the limit of the diopter range but I am able to see clearly. The Aldens seem fragile but once adjusted to your diopter you don't need to fiddle with them. I wish I could order a clear version. Mine are yellow tinted. I would not mind re-selling  these here is if could obtain a sturdier version with greater diopter range. Us old folks need all the range we can get!
4.0,Perfect accessory for pirating or lots of other costume looks!
4.0,"I wanted to purchase a pair to test for suitability as I sometimes recommend products on an alt lifestyle blog. I paid full price for this test set.<br /><br />The set arrived promptly, despite being sent from overseas. I noted one small glitch that made me rate them as four stars vs five, more on the glitch later.<br /><br />There are three beads. A red dangle, a silver ball that does not move (it is the clamp that holds the wire closed), and a black bead that does appear to be hematite.<br /><br />My small frown for these is the wire/cable used is thinner than I like to see. A slightly thicker wire should be used for more safety. Thinner wire can more easily damage skin. Remember, these are worn snugged down to prevent them from falling off, but are not designed for nipple &#34;torture&#34;.<br /><br />That said, these are comfortable to wear and stayed on without damage to my flesh. Use common sense, if you are being made uncomfortable or your skin is changing color, remove them immediately. These are not designed to be used in lieu of nipple clamps or clothespins. These are for looks, to be a pretty adornment.<br /><br />These will be a pretty addition to an under bust corset or photo session. They will make the nipples look perky under shirts. Decoration without piercing, or decoration in addition to piercing, these could be place in addition to nipple piercings, depending on the shape/placement of the piercing.<br /><br />These are well made with no sharp spots to cut the skin. The bead slides easily up and down the wire. Be careful not to bend or twist the wire, it should only be worn if it looks like a tear drop shape, if the top of the loop becomes bent, stop wearing them.<br /><br />Photo shown to demonstrate size, picture was taken before I tried them on. (Modeled photo not included, nudity is frowned upon.)"
4.0,"Super thin material but it worked for what I needed. Just wore it to a pool party with no intent of going swimming to be honest.<br /><br />I love the multiple strap options. I wore double sided tape to keep the edges in place as well as pasties because it’s see through.<br />I paired it with a long, black, double-sided high slit skirt.<br />I got many compliments on the swimsuit itself and people loved when I explained you can alter the strap."
4.0,It's small than expected and the chain is a little weak but what do you expect for the price.
4.0,Cut really small. My daughter's are not big girls at all and it fairly covers their butts. Tops are perfect however I would recommend wearing a different bottom.  received at discount for honest review..
4.0,I love this dress. I’m 5’3” and 145 pounds. I was worried it would show my poochie belly. But it doesn’t and also makes me look slimmer due to the way it’s made. It is so comfortable and stretchy. It hugs your body without showing fat rolls bad. It actually makes you feel a little more confident wearing it.
4.0,"Was as described, good fit , would buy again"
4.0,Smaller then expected but overall good quality. Perfect to be on the go.
4.0,I gifted someone with this purchase and she loves it.
4.0,"nice, but returned it because we decided on something else."
4.0,This necklace is everything I'd expected. The weight is perfect and the diamond-cut gives it sparkle. The delivery was the only down side. Ordered on the 18th and it arrived on the 29th.
4.0,I wish these came in a 1.5 power otherwise I like them
4.0,Best wallet I've owned
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; tall, 145 lbs.  I ordered the Medium.  It fits good, except I really wish that it were 1 inch longer.  It is okay...it hits the bottom of my ankles, but ideally it would be a little longer.  I kept the dress and will wear it, for it is comfortable.  Although many people liked the pockets, I don't really like the way they make me look &#34;hippy&#34;, for the pockets make the dress stick out a little on the sides where my hips are...so my hips look bigger than they are."
4.0,Love the necklace although it was very tangled from being shipped in a ziplock bag. Also the turquoise beading isn’t symmetrical but i bought to wear when I elope and personally love the character it adds
4.0,"Can’t say more good things. The colors are brighter thanI expected which is great. Such a great value to have 4 due rags and 4 wave caps together the same color. They feel great, fit my head well too!"
4.0,"I would give this review a five because of how cute these earrings are, but they do no stay in the ear cuff position, and they look a little cheap until you put them on. They are however super cute and as soon I can get them to hold still I will wear the crap out of them"
4.0,"I love these socks.<br />They warm, keep my toes cozy and they are crazy cute. These are my new winter go to socks."
4.0,For a C size woman they need to make the cup a little larger to hold and not show over spill when wearing softer material tops or dresses. This brand is a better fit from any other I’ve tried. I’ve been using these for about two weeks and have not had an issue with them slipping or coming off once in place. They also have washed & dried well.
4.0,Can't wait to give this as a gift!
4.0,"Very high quality for the price - overall, I'm happy with it!"
4.0,"Cute jacket! Soft. Beautiful color, I ordered the green. Giving it 4 stars because the arms are a bit short. I'm 5'10"" and when I stretch my arms it's a good 3 inches above my wrists. Ordered Xl"
4.0,"Certainly runs small, I had ordered a larger size for my daughter to grow into and it fit with little room to spare.<br /><br />It’s extremely soft and warm, she absolutely loves it and the colors are bright and vibrant too!"
4.0,"Was larger than a ""standard"" medium.  I will try washing it in very hot water - then drier in hopes it shrinks about 1/2 size..."
4.0,This dress is pretty cute and seems of good quality!  It does run a bit small.  I got the large but am returning for an xl.  I am 5:6 and 170.  I like the buttons on the back--gives a very feminon look to it.  Overall really like this dress and cant beat the price!!!
4.0,This is a cute matching set; it fits as expected and looks good on my stepdaughter.  The fabric is pretty comfortable.  Nice outfit.
4.0,They look nicer in person than in the picture. Good buy for the price
4.0,"This is really a pretty gown. My granddaughter loves the ponies, but the neck was a little large. It looks almost like a neckline for an adult. If it weren’t just for sleeping I would return but it fits elsewhere and she likes it. Other than that it’s nice."
4.0,I would give this 5 stars but these run small. My daughter just started wearing a size 9 and her toes are literally at the top.
4.0,"The construction isn't particularly high-end, and the built-in fasteners didn't keep it on (I have short hair), but with a couple of discrete hair clips, I enjoyed wearing this hat for Easter."
4.0,Love it. But it is hard to get back in the sleeve ... Probably just won't use it.  I would buy another one
4.0,"I've done quite a search, and these are the only ones of these I could find. Wish they came in black velvet, or even black. And if the holes were a bit higher on the card so brooches hang a bit higher."
4.0,"Does make night driving easier, but there is a noticeable 'after glare'/'ghost glare' of passing cars' headlights at the top of the lens. This 'after glare'/'ghost glare', however, is a small nuisance rather than a hindrance to the overall ability of these glasses to reduce glare at night."
4.0,"I wanted necklaces I could wear to work in a corporate setting, were appropriate year round, and comfortable to wear. I ended up ordering the green, beige, and red. The pieces are designed with backs on the 'flowers' so that there's no rub against your skin or clothes. Not sure how they'll work long term, but I've had mine for months and are holding up well. The colors stnad out without being overly jewel toned - which may not be work appropriate. For those who wear a lot of color in their wardrobe, or staple-colors like black/grey/white/navy, these are perfect compliments. The only improvement I would suggest is another 1"" in the chain closure - sometimes you want the chain to hit a little farther down your chest. Hasn't stopped me from wearing!"
4.0,Everything comes fine and was as expected. The quality is fine.
4.0,For the price I decided to take a chance. I’ve only had it a few days. So far quite good. I may order an additional  color soon.
4.0,This were for my daughter and she is very happy with them! loved them
4.0,[[VIDEOID:2c3dabbb94404bf1bc097341c3120f7b]] I like it. Might need to go a bigger size for this though but not bad for a s/m size
4.0,I still like it but it could have been a little size or 2 larger.
4.0,"super cute, washes well"
4.0,"The dress is form fitting and not too sheer. I'm 5.7"" 138lbs and ordered a small. Its also more of a burnt orange than brown"
4.0,This was what we were looking for - though possibly we should have chosen the larger size.  But the shawl was exactly as advertised.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  Good fit and very comfortable
4.0,We ordered a size 4t for my 3 year old but it fit like a 2t. We returned and will order a bigger size.
4.0,It is very beautiful but the color seem more bright in the picture.
4.0,nice earrings  good seller
4.0,Didn't like the stiffness of unfolding the glasses at the ears.
4.0,Like this dress.
4.0,"Smelled a bit strong after opening but its cute. My 8 yo wanted the Kate Spade cupcake purse, but that wasn't going to happen. I was able to appease her with this one. It is cute and fits all her 8 yo crap (lotion, gloss, pens, Shopkins, etc)."
4.0,"Pros: slim, easily holds 12 cards of varying thicknesses, good for front pocket carry, cards feel secure<br /><br />Cons: the glue for the money clip that is supposed to create some kind of friction to hold money in place came loose within the first two days, so now if you try to put a couple bills in there instead of being able to just slide money in you have to lift the whole clip to secure the bills."
4.0,This will given to one of my junior bridesmaids.  It's pretty but smaller than expected
4.0,"Cute, sized well, seemingly quality material and my boy loves them and says they're comfortable (and he tried on a handful!) Waiting to see how well they hold up through the rainy season !"
4.0,These socks really don't offer any compression but I would buy again as they are well made and comfortable.
4.0,Cute gift for teen.
4.0,"Bought these as a gift, so I can't speak to their &#34;wearability.&#34;  However, I did remove them from the packaging to see what they looked like up close.  These are smaller than I anticipated (which is just fine), but the detail is AMAZING!  They appear to be well made and solidly constructed.  They look more expensive than they actually were, which is also nice.  I'll update if I find out from the recipient about the wearability of the item."
4.0,It's too small size large is like a medium maybe extra large or extra extra large world look like a large
4.0,Love this dress! Super simple and so soft. It fits perfect and true to size
4.0,"It came a little on the small side. It's a nice made shirt, I won't dry as I want it to fit."
4.0,Expected the pages to be thicker or not as flimsy. The original windows lasted one year. I would like to purchase one of better quality.
4.0,The socks are very soft and thick so I’m sure they would be warm but they look worn out. There are specks of thicker blue threads through the entire sock that looks a little like someone sewed up holes.  Its clearly not the case but looked that way at first glance.<br /><br />I showed these to a family member who said “well who cares what it looks like since no one will see them.”  If you feel this way then maybe you won’t mind this issue. However I personally want something warm and cute! These aren’t cute and they’re are a lot of warm socks that are cute too.<br /><br />I really wanted to keep them since they’re so soft but I like pretty clothes including my socks.
4.0,"Well, I gave this a 4 star because there was some slight color streaks, other than that I LOVE it! Super Sexy, Super Shiny! I can't wait to take some pics and post, If they don't reject the pics that is. I have already ordered 3 more of different colors."
4.0,Can wear to work or for play.  I would recommend even though the price did increase.
4.0,"These are like Asian sizes. I am a 2Xl, ordered a 3XL because it said they run small. They didn’t lie but this is the equivalent of a XL in US sizes. So order 3 sizes up; this chunky nerd should’ve ordered a 5Xl. Instead, I’m going to diet and exercise to fit what I have. This is the way."
4.0,Bright enough. Clamp is a little too noticeable.
4.0,Nice glasses for both day and night activities.
4.0,My daughter absolutely loves these shoes. She literally puts them on as soon as she wakes up in the morning every day.
4.0,This is a great sweater that fits well and is not too bulky. I live in the Caribbean and it will be perfect for when I travel or in the cooler month of th year. It is classy in look. Love the tassles around the hem.
4.0,I really like these but they run a little small
4.0,"I wore this as a halloween outfit for a party last weekend and it was a hit. I also wore a black toule headpiece. I got a lot of compliments. I am 5'2"", 180, with a 38 D chest and just had a baby 7 weeks ago. My fupa area is in terrible condition and the size I got, large, didn't do a lot to hide it. I should have gone up a size. The L was a perfect fit, I'm just feeling self conscious these days. One plus is that even with my being so short, I felt like this was a great, flattering length on me, which is almost never the case. A couple of people told me they saw this dress on Amazon! This was a great all-in-one outfit, perfect for holiday spirit, teachers, work, and fun parties. I actually think I will keep it stored and wear it every Halloween. Its that easy and perfectly themed. I also liked that they have other themes, like christmasy and winter, hearts, etc. There are may options for other holidays. Overall excellent purchase, great price!"
4.0,I love the color and flower design around it and comes with the necklace to put the pendent in.Im not 100 percent sure its a real healing crystal though but it does feel a bit heavy like some crystals i have..Anyways so far im happy with it though i just got it a dy ago.Its pretty and my fav color! 😊
4.0,"El producto llegó bien y en la fecha indicada , le di cuatro estrellas por la razón de que la camisa se nota que no esta tan bien hecha pero no esta mal hecho , no soy un experto en maquinas de cocer pero algunas letras están mal a mi entender, la tela esta decente y en el tamaño lo pedí small por que un comprador dijo que los que son médium lo pidieran small por que corrían grandes , ciento que no esta tan mal para el precio , juzge usted pero lo recomiendo ."
4.0,"The metal  is nice with it's  finish,  but the chain is peeling you could see the brass finish  underneath."
4.0,"More of an off white color but the material is nice and warm, almost like a stronger type of felt? I haven’t worn it yet but I bought a small and it appears long and fitting like my other trench coats. Also has a “belt” so you can tighten it around your body. Great!"
4.0,"I think it runs a little large, but for a growing belly that really isn't a bad thing. The material is soft and stretchy and the design is as pictured. I like that the neckline isn't low, and that the shirt is nice and long. It doesn't feel very high quality and I doubt the design will last many washes (just assuming), but a very cute, functional tee for the price!"
4.0,"Its nice, gotten a few compliments. Wore it once and it turned on my wrist.  I was some what disappointed. 😞"
4.0,These are my favorite running bottoms for temps below freezing.  They do the job.  The one thing that could be better was the length was a bit short.
4.0,Too large for me so I gave them away to a friend who has a huge head and wears a beard.
4.0,Ran very small but I knew this from other review so I ordered a size up. Looks great and very comfy.
4.0,"Alright quality. Fits as expected, no problems yet."
4.0,"Pretty difficult to get the hooks open to put on the masks but once they’re on they don’t ever accidentally come off, which is good."
4.0,Needed to add a hole but otherwise it was prefect.
4.0,"Spacious beautiful bag. Holds alot. I am able to fit: toiletries bag, note book,large purse,cell,pens,tablet,novel, glasses/shades. The Gold accents are simple but add a lovely touch."
4.0,The skirt fit like a glove! Not only is it super comfortable it is also not see-through at all! I received many compliments! (The waistband has 0 stretch so be extra careful with the measurements)
4.0,"Luxury silk bottoms that fit easily under jeans. They could have been a bit longer, though."
4.0,Should have ordered 1 size up
4.0,light was very dim but everything else was great
4.0,Love this purse.  Got me around Europe with no problems!
4.0,Excellent material.The print is nice and bold as I had expected. Length is perfect. The only reason I am giving it a 4 * is because I usually use size M and ordered the same but it's little loose for me.
4.0,"These are great quality, but I wish it I would have gotten the ones that clip on the socks as well."
4.0,"This is definitely not the size it states. Fit a bit large,  more like a size 6. The stone looks a bit cheap, but I still really like it. The quality of the ring is pretty good, and has yet to fade, chip, or turn my finger green. Other than sizing, I would order again."
4.0,"Fits pretty good, material is not my favourite but overall I am happy with it"
4.0,Like the hammered finish.
4.0,"Hey, the price is right and without abuse and hard use,it should last at least three maybe four years. I don't remove it when riding the mower, so it takes a lot of shock without releasing. The hair on my arm does not get caught in it. I'm about average in that department. When I receive the package it had Chinese writing all over it. I wondered &#34;What the heck....&#34; the danged thing was mailed right from the factory! I have no complaints about this band."
4.0,"Nice little umbrella. It opens quickly, but if you are not careful when closing it, you will get wet. The material is much thinner than I expected, but for the price it works for me."
4.0,I ordered a medium and I probably could’ve done a large. I wear a 4 in lululemon
4.0,This jumper surprised me since I wasn't expected much for the price. It has alot of stretch and loops very elegant. I gave it a four because when I pulled it on and ready to zip the zip was broken and it fits me short. But I will replace the zip and still rock this jumper.
4.0,"I ordered an XL which is usually what I fit into.  Even with undergarments made to suck it all in, the dress was uncomfortably snug.  If you order this particular dress, consider going up a size.  Its better to have it too big and have it taken up.  In all, it was the style I was looking for and it was nicely made just too small."
4.0,"Haven't worn them except around house.  I ordered an 8 even though I usually go for 8.5 for toe room.  After reading about how these shoes are larger than actual size, I decided to go with the 8.  Glad I did; toes have room; not tight on heel; and they look great.  I needed a dress shoe that is not an open toe sandal type shoe; these are perfect!"
4.0,It's okay. Somewhat large tho
4.0,So far it has been a decent bra for my daughter. We hand dry it and wash on delicate cycle. She says it's comfortable.
4.0,Really cute bag and a great size!
4.0,Cute and good quality but fits a little larger than expected
4.0,"I am 5’7 and 125-130 lbs and ordered the medium bc reviews said to order a size up.  Had to return for a small and it fit perfectly!  The material is good for the price, and I received lots of compliments at my holiday party.  The only reason I knocked it down a point is bc one of the dresses had some lace pulled away from the seam but I was able to exchange it no problem."
4.0,It's a very cute shirt and made sturdy. It's exactly how the description  looks in the picture. It's a bit smaller so order 1 size larger than you normally wear. It's super cute though.
4.0,"Colors are beautiful, my daughter loves it. It is thin and slightly see through but overall a great little sweatshirt."
4.0,I got a size down and they fit fine
4.0,I really like the fact that this gym bag has the space for sneakers separate from my clothes.  This bag is a great gym bag.
4.0,"This item was almost perfect, with only two flaws.<br />It is slim fit, like expected. It fits my thigh like a glove with a little bit of extra room down to the ankles for comfort and for a masculine look. I ordered the charcoal grey and the light grey. Unlike some brands, they have almost the exact same fit, so they definitely have a high level of consistency if you want to buy multiple pairs as I did.<br />As for colors, the light grey was exactly what I expected, while the charcoal had a slight green tint. It's very subtle, though, and you would not notice from any distance away. It however does mean that it looks good with colors that compliment green as well as charcoal. But that should definitely be noted for not being a perfect greyscale. I will also say that the lengths are very accurate, but around the waist, for me, they were a slightly tighter than I like and require some adjusting to zip up.<br />Also it feels like a very premium material was used, it doesn't feel as rough as cotton or anything like that. The spandex, while providing some stretch for comfort and to protect against tearing, gives it a more smooth and warm to the touch, textured feel. It's hard to explain, but everyone loves it."
4.0,"Es preciosa,las 4 estrellas es por que es toda verde,pero igual es bonita y al ser semipreciosas nunca será igual que la foto,que también es bueno pues si es todas las piedra igual no son original.."
4.0,Very cute but size runs much smaller than normal. I typically wear a M or L top and a 3XL in this top was almost too small
4.0,It was like a regular t shirt and the quality wasnt that nice.
4.0,Very cute but runs large.
4.0,I can't decide if these are stahying or going back.  Large is too small to fit comforatably over thicker socks on my size 9 feet.  Would have expected roomier fit.
4.0,Practical and pretty yet they pill after multiple wearings
4.0,Soft and pretty. 2y/o loves it but it is a little big as I ordered a 3 to fit longer.
4.0,"Got this for my daughter.  She is 5' 6"" and about 135 lbs. Got a medium. She said it is stretchy but hoods shape well. Her only complaint is the top is pretty thin so she had to be careful in choosing a bra."
4.0,fits just as I expected and is perfect  to wear at my factory job. also looks good to just wear out and about. the hood is a perfect length not like pervious hoodies I have had where you had to keep tugging at them to stay in place. my only complaint is the top of the hood looks pointy if it was rounded out more when sewn together it would be perfect. but being I have only had a couple weeks it may fix its self over time.
4.0,Fits my daughter a little big but she loves it. The dress is not thin. Well worth the money.
4.0,I am a 40i and this top hold me in well. I will need to use boob tape for extra security but overall this top fit great. It’s soft and light on the skin. I got both black and white
4.0,"A bit big that I expected. Good quality, nice color and style."
4.0,"Great sweater! Light, perfect length. Very pleased with purchase."
4.0,"It a good fit, but a little big.I purchased a Large. A medium would have been perfect."
4.0,nice dress. perfect fit
4.0,"Pros:<br />I love the form, well made with great material, fits perfectly in a locker.<br />Feels like its price<br /><br />Cons (Design Improvements Needed)<br />1.  A large carabiner clip.  This bag works best when you hang it from the rod in the locker.<br /><br />2.  Should be able to stand on its own.<br />  - When I bring it home or set it down, it won't stand up straight and falls over unless propped against a wall.<br /><br />3.  Front door should open like a hinged door.<br />  - The big U-shaped Zipper door falls down instead of opening like a door.<br />  -  Ideally the door closes and latches with a magnet or velcro or a latch<br />  - It requires 3 times too much zippering<br />  zip up to the top of the bag and then bag down<br />  then unzip smaller top compartment<br />  duffel bags open much quicker<br />  - As the door falls down, it blocks the area underneath the bag<br />  - Things fall out of the outer pocket if you haven't closed the door pocket<br /><br />4.  The interior has button snaps to hold the levels together and removable shelves.<br />  - I wish everything was fixed or at least better secured.<br /><br />Hope that there's a v2 with some improvements."
4.0,Thought it was goig to be a little bigger. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant and wanted it for the hospital but it is just shy of fitting perfect. It should fit after the baby
4.0,"This is a decent quality shirt. I ordered a M and I'm 5'9'', 150. I usually wear M. This shirt was a tad snug but not so much that it looks bad. If you want more form-fitting, then order your regular size. A little roomier then order a size up. The material is nice and comfortable. It's a cute top, not amazing but not so bad I want to return it. I like how it's longer in the back and shorter in the front."
4.0,Been using these for a year and a half with significant (but not daily) use. The internal padding is rather thin but has not worn away. They haven't developed any holes. The grip surface is tough and provides a little extra purchase but I would not buy them for that reason. If you want some durable gloves at a reasonable price then these are better than most.
4.0,"nice, no complains"
4.0,Perfect for casual summer work dress
4.0,"I won't show up as a verified purchase, because I received it as a gift, but I love this watch. Power reserve at least 24hours.<br />The clasp on the wrist band I don't trust, the only reason I have<br />it four stars. Lots of likes!"
4.0,Nice fit and it's comfy and soft. So far no lint.
4.0,"The shoe is so cute! Can't wait to give to my granddaughter at Christmas! Was disappointed when delivered, came in a plastic bag, no box!"
4.0,Love it but fits very small. I ordered a size larger and it’s still pretty small.
4.0,"This jacket is good for those who want a warm motorcycle jacket for chilly morning commutes and rides in fall weather. The length is good with appropriate rear tail and armor pocket. The sizing seems to run a bit small, so a size up is likely prudent when ordering. I like that the elbow and shoulder armor ""lands"" in good position while wearing the jacket (kind of important in a slide). The included armor is CE level 1 (fine at this price point). This jacket lacks the venting options available in its higher priced cousins, but that's OK. I do wish there was a breast pocket for phones, wallets, etc. Also, the placement of the hand warmer pockets is a bit awkward and they are a bit small. It is pretty warm with the liner zipped in and makes a decent shell with the liner out given its breathable  layer."
4.0,"It is super cute and good quality, and if it fit, it would be adorable.  I chose a small based on the chart sizes and it fit more like a medium would on me.  In US sizes, I tend to be a size 4, sometimes a 2 depending on the brand, never a zero.  I would have though I needed an extra small because I'm not overly chesty, but the size chart indicated a small.  My 34Cs did not come close to filling the top - easily could have fit 38D.  The skirt is rather large as well, and the waste had an extra 2&#34;.  But overall, it really is a great, classy dress.  Just order down a size."
4.0,Awesome fit and looks beautiful
4.0,Good value for money.  Good service.
4.0,It fits a bit short (and I’m short) but that wasn’t a surprise. Cute dress.
4.0,"A little flimsy/delicate, but because they are so small I'm not worried about them getting caught. They don't irritate my ears and that's the big thing for me. I can't wear big hoops at work or with my kids so they do the trick for a good every day pair of bling."
4.0,Boyfriend liked it a lot! Said it fit him like any other cap but looked a little big on top. Go Bulldogs!
4.0,It’s a lovely dress-very soft and surprisingly stretchy. It’s a little on the small size (especially if you’re a bigger girl like me with thick arms) but the quality is great. Just go a size up.
4.0,Wore dress for wedding. A little more clingy than expected.
4.0,They do work. It’s just a bit too complicated to put on especially after you wash them. It’s also feels like lot more nylon than cotton. I changed them to regular underwear after I come back from work because they are not comfortable to have on for long time. But they do actually work
4.0,Could hsve been a little bigger.
4.0,for my size of biceps are too tigh and make me marks.
4.0,I do not like the buckle on the band but otherwise it is ok
4.0,"This purse hanger works very well. It holds more than 1 bag. It does not work on all tables, however, and the hook that is attached to the purse is not a simple on/off to make easy transition from one purse to another, but it also isn't going to fall off and get lost. I would consider buying another."
4.0,Cute pant and very versatile. Will wear these all summer.
4.0,"I thought if I ordered this large enough may I could wear it as a dress, but the slit comes up way too high and will definitely need leggings. I'm going to order another one for such. The fabric is not high quality as to be expected for the price."
4.0,Sparkly and Pretty a good size for teens. Just got them so not sure about the wear quality just yet.
4.0,Purchased as a gift for a friend. She said they are helpful and eases eye strain.
4.0,Replacement for one i had similar.  Slightly cheap but not terrible
4.0,Nice storage case and comfortable
4.0,"Nice silver charm, good size. Had to take away a star because it has an open back, looks unfinished. Without a back it also makes it more of a lightweight piece, and I like my charms to have weight to them. But I love fleur de lis, so this will still be a nice charm to have."
4.0,This Jacket is as pictured it is chic and fits well. The band around the waits is detachable. It has a wide open chest so if u want sexy you can wear it without anything as the model but if you want the corporate look a nice little camis would work nicely. I have a arge bust and tiny wait ad bought mine in a medium and it fits great.
4.0,It works great and makes my jewelry shine.  I took off a star since I didn't like the huge advertisement in the middle of the cloth.
4.0,They were everything I expected!
4.0,It is nice. The strap does not stay closed. But other than that fine
4.0,T-shirts are different in size. Some of them fit perfectly while others run a little small.
4.0,These should have been loose fit . They fit well in the waist. Length a little to long but ok. A little to thin for the material.  The designer should use black men to design these pants. Black men with a muscle leg structure. You can tell the are not designed for athletes build structure. When squatting a little tight around the knees.
4.0,"Hi, This was second time I order.  1st it was not a hooded I received 2nd time I received a hooded with white letters and not Red as in the picture.  I kept it but I should get what I order.  Fits nice and very nice hood"
4.0,Perfect fit in medium for my little brother.
4.0,"Cute. Need to repair mine but I'm being lazy. I enjoyed it for the first few hours.<br /><br />Now, people complaining... if you don't own two pairs of pliers to simply fix bargains like this, then don't buy it."
4.0,"Cute, wish it was sterling silver though"
4.0,Beautiful dress! Great bright colors!
4.0,"The kids love these! They are colorful and comfortable, and kids never have too many basic t-shirts."
4.0,"It does look like the picture.  My only concern is that the lace opening in the front does still show my strapless bra...and the arm holes are a little low do it shows the bra on the sides too.  BUT, I am wearing a cotton bandeau black bra that really looks like part of the shirt wear it shows.  So I am happy overall with the look."
4.0,"This is a very lightweight, thin jacket capable of protecting you in light rain only. That being said, it is very fashionable and comfortable to wear. Order down one size for room to later under. Oder down two sizes for a true fit."
4.0,"I like the watch,  it's just too early to rate it cause it's a Christmas gift . I hope my son will like it"
4.0,"Very soft, comfortable. Does not wrinkle after washing. Great top for jeans, shorts or leggings."
4.0,"Great quality, washes well too.  Grease from a covered dish at Christmas leaked allover the front...when I got home I washed it and the grease came right out.  I was impressed!  The top is a bit larger then I expected but worn with leggings it looks pretty good."
4.0,"The right size,nice cotton and I really like the patterns and vibrant colors."
4.0,Very retro. Adds a cute old school to the modern female. Recommended to get in touch with your inner grooviness. Fun product
4.0,"I was given this in silver as a gift - it is a truly lovely necklace.<br /><br />I love the simplicity and delicacy of the fleur de lis pendant/charm, and the chain is also delicate and quite sparkly.  I’m happy that I can wear the chain at a short length.  The adjustability will surely be of use to others as well.<br /><br />My only concern is the attached ring at the top of the fleur de lis.  It is very thin and I’m worried about it breaking.  It surely couldn’t withstand much tugging.  The charm itself seems sturdy, though.<br /><br />I will update after wearing it for awhile!"
4.0,Cool dress but I chose the wrong size
4.0,Easier to put on than the last pair I bought.
4.0,"It had a funky smell when I got it, but I washed it and it's better now."
4.0,I really llike it.  It holds my phone perfectly and it easy to get to when I need to.  Down side:  The card slots are not long enought to hold the credit cards. And the wrist band broke.  But I picked up one at JoAnn's fabric for $2 that works great.  It has room for a pen and lipstick.  It expands to hold more than I expected.  I would recommend this product to a friend.
4.0,These are super cute and fit great. I bought some 6g and then bought some 4g since I'm still streching.
4.0,"Feels a tiny bit small, but still all right!"
4.0,"This was really cute and my best friend loved it! I'm giving it 4 stars because I showed it to my nephew, (which is 2) and he thought it was a real avocado! He tried to shove it down his gullet before my sister swooped in right before he ate it. I guess this traumatic moment taught me a lesson, never show him anything that looks like food."
4.0,"This is definitely not the size it states. Fit a bit large,  more like a size 6. The stone looks a bit cheap, but I still really like it. The quality of the ring is pretty good, and has yet to fade, chip, or turn my finger green. Other than sizing, I would order again."
4.0,I know that's not the name but it had me thinking about the movie Life.  It is a solid good watch accessory for roaring 20's party. My man was a Peakyblinder that night! Get it!
4.0,"A little snug but I feel tucked in for sure. If you are a southerner like myself, get ready to sweat because it is 18 kinds of hot in the thing."
4.0,was missing a few sequins
4.0,"Nice shirt but the purple color is more of a rich lavender color not the deep purple color, but its still very pretty."
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, great for travel! It has &#34;Passport&#34; written in black on the back which I personally didn't like, but it serves it's purpose."
4.0,Fits perfectly! Love it and that a portion goes to MS! My only complaint is why is it teal? MS colors are orange...
4.0,I'm constantly getting compliments on this band & gray IS the new black!! My wrists are pretty small but a friend of mine quickly added another hole & there's no tearing or visible damage!
4.0,"Love the shirt, hubby has two already which were purchased in store so we felt confident about the size when we ordered it.  Barely fit so had to return, but the quality was the same so it would have been a good purchased had it worked out."
4.0,I have a small wrist but even the large fit tight but it is nice to slide on and off
4.0,The unicorn face doesn't look as clear as the picture maybe because it's smaller then I expect. The pendent fell off right after we receive it but it's easy to put it back. You could lose it while you wear it outside. That's why I give it four star.
4.0,The quality on these boots is just ok.  My son absolutely loves them but next time I will spend a little more to get a better quality.
4.0,Nice looking band. Glad I was able to use a dremel  cut off wheel I had without cutting it to short. Glad I sized it right. Otherwise I guess real sharp snips might work.
4.0,The pajamas came right on time and fit perfectly.
4.0,"Great rings, they look super cute, but they run a little small. They fit like a US size 6/7. Good quality though."
4.0,"These are nice looking. They have the longer legs, which teens and men prefer. They also have the Hawaiian motif, which is always popular. These look pretty good. Men will love the mesh lining to keep their junk in place and they will love the two pockets. The material is a bit on the light side and I don't know how well they will do when wet. But when dry, they are great."
4.0,4mm is perfect ball size for piercings. Not too bulky. And I lose mine a lot so I have to buy in bulk. These were a great price.
4.0,"Very thin material, won't last many launderings, cute design."
4.0,I like the gloves but i wouldn't say they would keep your hands warm in -30 degree temps. I used them in mid 20's F and they were just okay. I believe my hands would have gotten cold if the temps were in the single digits. (F).  I have not used them in -30 degree temps so i don't have a true opinion of their ability.
4.0,"For the price, it's actually pretty cool. The outer coating on the ring started to discolor and grow spotty over time. But it was not very noticeable at all. I recently lost mine and will probably purchase again. I had this ring for about seven months. Lettering isn't deep set at all, so if you're looking for something that really looks like the original, you're looking in the wrong place!"
4.0,"Bought this item thinking I might want to use it for a Wednesday Addams Halloween costume, but ended up returning it. I thought it wasn't as flattering on me as the pictures online made it look and even though I liked the neckline, the dress felt more like a tent rather than a flowy dress. The fabric was good quality, warm enough for spring, but not too thick for summertime either. I think if someone wants a dress that isn't as fitted, I would highly recommend this, maybe even with a belt on top to cinch your waist. Sadly I couldn't see myself wearing this on a daily basis so I didn't want to buy it for just one Halloween costume. For $11 though it was absolutely worth the quality and I would recommend it for other people who are a bit more modest."
4.0,"They actually look nice, not cheap.  My only complaint is that unfortunately the pendant on the left with the blue background has a little too much black around the edges, especially where the dragon's head is so it basically disappears which makes it hard to figure out what it is especially from any distance... too bad."
4.0,"Way too small!!! Read reviews, JUNIORS 2x, not a woman's!  Was a nice soft shirt, just not a woman's when buying a woman's you expect a womans"
4.0,"Cool concept and the watch works well.  It took me a couple minutes to figure out how to set the date and time, but was easy.  My only complaint is that the face is larger and stiff so it doesn't form well to a smaller wrist."
4.0,"Work well for using on cards, but could be a little bit larger."
4.0,"Nice soft material, love this t-shirt I have had quite a few compliments on how cute it is .<br />I would recommend."
4.0,It’s a nice pair of yoga pants but thin enough for winter season and runs a little big. Tried on once and don’t like I have to pull them up every now and then.
4.0,This purse is really cute but very small.
4.0,"Other than size running a bit small, the shoe is good quality for the price. I love the size of the corduroy textile."
4.0,Wear this often and I think it looks really nice. Would buy again.
4.0,Like the style & color
4.0,The material is nice. I just have to see how it will wash. I Ordered a Large and I'm 5'7&#34; and 155lb. It had a little room beacuse I bought it a size up for work.
4.0,To small but was good
4.0,It is a bit big for me but it is very nice. Since I like to be completely covered. The front over lapping works for me. The colors are great.
4.0,Very nice but the chain if fragile.
4.0,"I love the width of the band, but the depth/girth of the ring is more than I thought it would be.Overall, it is a great back up, and I absolutely love the color as none have the bronze tone."
4.0,I really like the styling and a very nice looking watch.<br />The only dislike is when I use the timer.  When I go to reset to zero it doesn’t quite make it to 0.  It’s a few seconds off.  But that’s okay.  I still love the watch.
4.0,A little small pic but good
4.0,The glass this made for don't fit exactly right but they fit and this protects them in storage and travel to and from the range. If it was a better fit then 5 stars.
4.0,Nice belt but not quite as thick or wide as expected. But it does work well with a holster work with different layers of clothing. The holes allow for infinite lengths.
4.0,"My son loves this. It is soooooo soft! He is very small for his age, though and I bought a size (really 2 sizes) bigger than I usually do and it is barely baggy, so buy big!"
4.0,"I like this shirt, I feel like it was a great buy. The quality wasn't what I was expecting and that's why I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,I love it.  The dress fits good.
4.0,I like the fit and comfort. I would have liked to feel the padding more.  I assume this is washable...
4.0,the shorts were everything i thought they would be except the fact the sizing seems way off.  couldnt even get them up my legs past the knees.  had to give them to my son
4.0,"Nice purse, good quality but too small for all the stuff I carry in my purse."
4.0,"Very pretty. A little smaller than I thought it would be, but great color."
4.0,Great lighter. Hasn't failed me yet. Turn down the flame to halfway unless you want to re fill everytime you use it. Have only filled it with xikar puriflame butane. Only the best.i recomend this lighter.
4.0,Very nice! It looks really classy. I would t mind wearing it even in formal occasions.
4.0,"I like this bra, but it can be seen as ""pink"" through white shirts"
4.0,"This is a great bag - the quality is just as advertised. It is a little smaller than expected, but still perfect size for me. The only issue I have is that the white is more of a cream/beige color."
4.0,I love the dress. It is simple and love the pockets. You can wear with a belt to accentuate your waist or as is for casual wear
4.0,Nice quality.  Only drawback is the clasp is a bit clunky to open at times.
4.0,Very nice product. Fit well.
4.0,They seem to be pretty decent for the price. No complaints.
4.0,My son was a great fan. We would throw it to each other and dance but it came a little chipped.
4.0,"Love, love, love it!  Just one thing I wish the handles were made of a quilted material and weren't so stiff!  When carrying on ones shoulder the handles have a tendency to rub ones shoulder due to the stiffness."
4.0,the price was great. the charms are beautiful
4.0,Fit was great but the material wasn't as thick as I would have liked
4.0,I was pleased with the article.  I had been looking for this model Cuddl Dud for sometime.  I like that they streamlined the edging on the sleeve.  My previous shirt the edge of the sleeve began to come loose.
4.0,"These socks are super cute and soft. They are perfect fit for women/girls who have longer, thinner legs. I wear a size 7.5 and the foot fits great, but they are a bit snug over the knee area. I am 5’3” so they come a few inches above my knee. I like that there is a little bit of stretch to them though, so still very comfortable. They work great for wearing with my tall boots or with a skirt (or shorts too). Since they aren’t too thick, you could use them instead of tights since they are so long – great for cooler spring and fall days! The do say “lambs wool” on them – so not cotton like the description says. They aren’t itchy at all like wool can be and are better quality than most socks I’ve tried.<br />I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Purchased as gift for husband's aunt. She loved the color & feel but were far too small. Very disappointing.
4.0,Very cute swimsuit. I bought two sizes one for each grandchild. Both looked really cute but both were bigger than I expected and I have to tie the sleeves up every time they use the suit. The leg holes are big as well. They still work however
4.0,"Gave this to my father for Christmas and he is always looking for cool bow ties.  Interestingly, he has had a difficult time finding Christmas bow ties, so he was quite happy."
4.0,"Sharp looking for work, slightly small."
4.0,No complaints as far as looks
4.0,If you don't want attention don't buy this hat....everyone has a comment but I love that hat. It's a little bigger than I expected so it seems almost costume type but I enjoy it.
4.0,I would consider these a XXL versus and XL size
4.0,"These leggings fit me well and they do seem to be a small/medium, so although they say sizes 0-10 I would be surprised if they were a comfortable fit on a size 10. These are fleece lined inside but a more slick material on the outside that I don't think will pill like fleece does. These are really comfortable and are a good length for me. I have been wearing these around the house and as leggings in the winter time and love them. I purchased these in pink, black, and burgandy."
4.0,My butt is a little too big for it :( It's a nice swim suit despite this.
4.0,"I really like the sandal. The color is nice they’re really cute however they’re a little skinny on the sole of the shoe. I did a side-by-side comparison of some other sandals, so you could see the difference. It’s not terrible but if you have white or feet, there’s a possibility your foot could be hanging off definitely size up a bit!"
4.0,I love it. Fits purrrfect.
4.0,"I'm giving it 4 ☆☆☆☆ only because they're very soft and comfortable, but in the thin side"
4.0,These for great on all my different pairs of glasses and are comfortable. They do block side vision just a bit so be careful.
4.0,"I like this scarf, but it's a smidgen too big. I will have to pull it tighter and tie the ends, so I won't have the two &#34;ponytails&#34; hanging down. It's a nice scarf though."
4.0,I bought this dress for my preteen daughter who is 5'1 1/2 with a medium build.  I bought a Women's Medium.  She loved the dress and it looked great on her.  The only thing is it was a bit too low in the front so she had to wear a Cami Bra as she is only 12 years old.
4.0,Order these for my grandchild both my daughter and her child loved them.
4.0,"Got this as a gift from a friend. She ordered the XXL size. It fits me perfectly. For reference, I'm 5'9, 215, D cup. I wear a standard size 14 in Old Navy/Target/Ann Taylor."
4.0,"I did not order this particular shirt,I had order a different style of shirt but I like it anyway."
4.0,"Theyre great. They feel light, came in little seperate packages. Im worried that threading on the tunnels could possibly strip, so im just going to be careful. But they are super cute"
4.0,"I would have wished the Lace was little better quality.  I purchased this dress for last minute function,  for that it did the job."
4.0,"Very soft material, high quality."
4.0,Material was thin.
4.0,Wore this to a conference and dinner. Got many compliments!
4.0,I am a true xl and it fits perfect!
4.0,Very cute and a decent price for the product.
4.0,"These are nice for sore hands. And the colors are nice as well. One of them did break on the second day, but there are enough of them that it's ok."
4.0,this is very nice and a good price
4.0,Very cute but the ears should be bigger
4.0,I love this tank top... It’s super cute and I would definitely purchase if you’re wondering. The lace and pearl detail adds a nice touch for a night out!
4.0,It’s a very pretty dress but you have to bustty for it to fit well around the chest. Quality is not the best.
4.0,Fits larger than true size. But the graphics are outstanding.
4.0,"Nice and warm, don tlike the thumb slits as much but still workable"
4.0,"Adorable, small, well made! Got these for my sons crocks and he loves them! They feel strong enough that popping them in and popping them out should be easy and not ruin them. We did not recieve the toad piece tho, which my son was most excited for so i docked a star."
4.0,"I ordered this to give a friend for her birthday.  She likes sparkly jewelry, so I think she will be quite happy with this.  The color is very pretty & it IS sparkly!"
4.0,Great for the price. Thick material
4.0,It would have been perfect had it worked when it arrived. Still haven't had a battery put in but it definitely is nice.
4.0,Below quality but good bargin
4.0,Love the look and light weight❤
4.0,"My son likes them, they run a lil big but thats fine. He will grow into them."
4.0,"Loved it, but my chain broke."
4.0,The legs are not as wide like the picture or asking I'm 5'8 and it touches top of foot
4.0,Good quality. Fast service. Grandson is excited to wear them.
4.0,"I loved the purse, but it was too small. Returning and ordered another."
4.0,Really interesting piece. Can't wait to wear. Loves the fact I can wear with so many things.
4.0,"Quality isn't very good, and they run small. I would recommend at least 1/2 to 1 whole size up.  I didn't expect much to begin with but I think they are fairly comfortable, and I can live with them. Time will tell how long they actually last though."
4.0,"I ordered the grey color.  It wasn’t as dark as the picture, maybe they sent me the light grey one by mistake?  But otherwise super comfortable & holds up to washing"
4.0,"Nice belt and buckle, but dues to the design sitting down can be a little pointy."
4.0,Very nice tie clip. However it tends to move around a bit.
4.0,Would give 5 stars but these are really stiff. No bites though.
4.0,"Bought 2. 110-3 yo small child, fit fine. 120-5yo thin tall child, fits fine. The next size up would have been too long."
4.0,"I liked these a lot. But be warned, they are heavy and actually stretched my ears to 11mm."
4.0,Very stylish sunglasses.  Looks fantastic and the reading glasses work fine.
4.0,Well made but did not match my face shape.
4.0,Fit a bit tight but was fine
4.0,"Bought for daughter who is 8, she loves it! If I were to wear it that’s where it fits on me . So short for an adult but perfect for a kid unless you don’t mind. Cute and a great buy!"
4.0,"[[ASIN:B002ZHKAI8 Happy Feet - Lion - Animal Slippers - Medium]] These are adorable, and I love them. Happy Feet has always made greet slippers. I do have a couple of complaints about these particular slippers, though: 1. There was a hole in the back of one of them. I was able to easily hand stitch it up, but this shouldn't have been an issue (I could see the stuffing ready to come out). 2. These seem like perhaps the quality isn't as good as previous ones I've bought in the past. The very bottom doesn't seem to be the same quality material, nor does it seem to be stitched on as securely. I'm nervous that these might not last as long as others I've purchased in the past. If this trend continues, I might have to buy from a different company in the future. Crossing my fingers that it's just a fluke."
4.0,I only give 4 stars because the picture shows them to be gold and I received silver. Other than that I love them!
4.0,"I love the forgiveness of the dress in my mid area. I love the off the shoulder option. I also love the split. It was in a wrap so it showed just enough leg, but not too much."
4.0,"I like the style and internal organization.  The quality is nice, except there are a couple of broken stitches at the end of the external zipper pocket.  Not sure whether to exchange it"
4.0,"Bought a large for a costume so I cant speak to size (am usually a sm or med.) Worked great but heads up this coat SHEDS long yellow ""furs"" that stock to everything. Have had the car cleaned twice and they're still stuck around lol"
4.0,"Good, cheap watch.  I got it for my son and it is perfect for him."
4.0,My toddler started gymnastics and she ‘needed’ a leotard. Not an easy find under size 3t. I ordered the smallest one they had which was marketed 9-24 months. We all know nothing is going to fit a kid at 9 mon til 24 months! But it worked perfectly for my petite 18 month old with a little room to grow.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Just a bit tight for my built. But overall a great dress
4.0,cute but the hearts were all backward so now I have to find pliers to take them off and put them on facing the right way
4.0,"Colors are nice. I sized up due to being nervous they were european/asian sizing. I am a 36 c and where medium shirts. The fit is a little loose, but comfortable. Zipper detail is nice and mesh in frobt is fun. Does not offer support for cardio etc, but good for pilates or yoga. Nice to wear with open back activewear."
4.0,This is a great dress for a swim cover or a day at the beach the pockets are very big and don’t really lay flat so it makes the dress look bigger. I wore it to a lunch with friends it’s very soft but more casual then dressy
4.0,"Fits like a tight glove. It does roll up at the bottom when I sit and I wish it were 2-3+ inches longer in the torso to prevent that. I'm not sure what the back two holes are for, shoulder blades? but it looks a little weird and wish that those weren't there at all. I was also worried about stretching and it losing it's shape, but so far so good, it seems to go back to it shape for the most part after washing."
4.0,With correct measurements your purchase will be most enjoyable.
4.0,I am 5'4 and about 113 lbs. My chest isn't very big. So the dress was a bit too loose on top. I ordered a small. And it was still too big for me. Other than that it's made well. Just doesn't fit right.
4.0,These pants are made of nice fabric.  They are definitely not made for women with any curves.  I typically wear a size 6/7 and the pants fit really tight in the stomach area.  The tightness causes the crotch area to bunch really weird and make them look awkward.  If you do not have a tummy and an a** these might look good on you.  Sorry no picture because they looked bad on me.  I couldn't even zip them all the way up.
4.0,"I got it and the material is a stretchy cotton (more like a thick jersey).  I was skeptical at first,but it fits well.  It does ride up and needs to be pulled down periodically.<br /><br />Very good fit, nice color and I like the bow."
4.0,"Soft fabric, plenty large enough, pretty bright color, and low price.  All good."
4.0,It ran small the 2X fit like a XL gave it to my daughter and she receives many compliments every time she wears it!
4.0,Nothing wrong..pretty
4.0,"After starting our business in healthcare I had to be on the computer pretty much all day. Add the regular day to day computer use and that equals eye strain, headaches and increased poor vision. I'm talking I pet my dogs head and told my son he really needed a haircut... Ok I'm kidding but myeyes have gotten increasingly worse. I looked up these computer blue light blocking glasses and purchased.  After using them on blue light emitting devices all above problems are eliminated except for eyesight. Although that isn't improved, my eyesight isn't getting worse, so that's great. The only reason for the 4 star rating is I don't like the color yellow (the tint of the glasses) but other than that they're worth the purchase."
4.0,"I thought this ring would be nice to wear since my son was in the 101st Airbourne. But the ring is too HUGE for me to wear! It fits my finger okay (size 9), but it is so large! Maybe a guy like The Rock, or Steve Austin could wear it. So, if you're not a big guy, be prepared for this ring to look huge on your finger. Otherwise, it is a beautiful ring with a lot of details."
4.0,"Based on reviews, I sized up to 13. (I normally wear 11.5 to 12.) Glad I did, as it's a perfect fit sized up, but it would have certainly been too small if I ordered my standard size. The ""wide"" actually does make these slippers wider than most, which is great. They're pretty comfortable. As long as they hold up well, I have no complaints. Just be aware that they're sized wrong."
4.0,"Cute, but more pink than rose gold, so returned."
4.0,It fits well. Hate the padding but without it it is super comfty
4.0,"I am 137lbs, and the majority of that extra weight is in my boobs (32DDD). That being said, it would look better with someone with smaller breasts. Sometimes, I wear a sweater or pretty long sleeve shirt over it, and it makes for a pretty skirt. I got a medium and am 4'11."
4.0,I felt like the dress ran large. I normally wear a small and the small was WAY too big on me.
4.0,Very light weight. Some of the stitching is not finished or trimmed though.
4.0,They were for a costume but the quality seems nice for the money.
4.0,"I really love the vest.  It's a bit snug, but I can wear a thinner sweater underneath and it will fit fine. If they offered an XXL it would be a perfect fit while zipped."
4.0,"This is better than a Jelly of the month club for a bonus! A little smaller than wanted, but works."
4.0,Very different and very sexy. I wear a U.S. Medium and it fit great except a little tight around the thighs. The material is a little thin so you would have to wear a thong or short biker shorts. Other than that the colors options are pretty and shipping is fast.<br />I received this product as a discount to review my honest opinion. I write my true honest opinions about the product. I do not work for the seller or get paid for my reviews. Thank you
4.0,"Just what I needed. Spacious, easy to carry.It goes with different styles.... nice purse."
4.0,You really have to guess when it comes to sizing on these.  The pair I grabbed fit me just fine.  These are pretty stretchy as well and not your typical jean material.  These are way shorter than Bermuda though and a little too short for my liking.  I was expecting them to be thigh length and they are not.
4.0,"Its a gorgeous dress, looks good on. However its a bit snug for an XL when using the zipper, my husband couldn't even get it zipped. But when i leave it zipped up and pull it over my head it fits good. So id say it runs not quite a half size smaller than i was expecting. Back does stop below the bra level so if you dont like showing your back keep that in mind.<br /><br />The beading is amazing, I have sensitive skin and normally any designs bother me but this dress is made such a way that doesn't bother my skin. So that is a big plus. And it breathes so wearing it for longer periods of time makes it way comfortable.<br /><br />Very pleased with the dress and couldnt beat the price!"
4.0,I really like it. I'm always looking for more space in a purse. This one is nice and roomy and goes with a lot of things.
4.0,Loved it well made washed and dried beautifully
4.0,I'm going to give this necklace as a Christmas gift. Its cute and will make a good gift. .. ..
4.0,"Shoes were in good condition, but the size is not as expected. My daughter wears a toddlers size 6, and these shoes were way too small. Had to return them, and unfortunately they didn't have the next size up. :("
4.0,I ordered this shirt for my niece birthday party and they had went beyond my expectations to deliver it in time!! However I should have never ordered a XL lol it’s super huge and I cannot wear it! I feel like I’m wearing a mu mu on or a night gown! It goes beyond my knees lol I love the designs and I am going to order again but in a smaller size and the purple one!!
4.0,The dress are very comfortable.  I will order again
4.0,Small and serves its purpose. Looks good.
4.0,"Made well. Sewed on top and bottom. Wish a little heavier or double lined.  Seem too stay put, but they are still new. Coloring is vibrant."
4.0,"This  bamboo bag with unique designs and well made , the Bag Size: 11.02x7.87x2.99 Inches,it’s perfect size good enough big hold cell phone, wallet, etc love it"
4.0,I'm getting used to it.  I like it now.  I have to use it close to my eye.  Nice though.
4.0,"Decent duality for the price. the pieces are a little fragile and prone to breaking if bent slightly. other than that, they have a good finish and are well detailed."
4.0,"Product was shipped as promised and in great shape.  The necklace is beautiful. The topaz  sparkles and the chain is a great length.  However, the earrings are very difficult to get on and off. That was very frustrating and my wife still has not worn the earrings.  That’s the reason for a 4 rating.  Other than that it is a great looking set."
4.0,"At first, I thought I had ordered the wrong size.  I'm a size 9 in US Women's shoe sizes, and usually when I order slippers and other foot items that come in S/M/L/XL sizing, I stick with M/L size.  Since this didn't have that blended size to choose from, I thought I had ordered a M because I wanted them to be tight since they are meant to be compression socks.  When I realized I ordered L, I thought I was in for getting compression socks I would have to either return or hand over to my husband.  But no!  The L was just what I needed!  They were perfectly tight.<br /><br />Now, as to why I didn't exactly love them - well, if I wore them too long, I'm sure I would have developed blisters on the bottom of my foot where there was no toe.  I'm sure I would have if I had left them on longer.  But I had to take them off after only three hours because my ankles really started to itch.  I don't think it was the fabric or anything.  It just - I don't know.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a discount on this product in return for a review."
4.0,"easy to read display, with date as well as the time"
4.0,"I kept seeing influencers with these fuzzy slippers, so I was curious to try them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Soft<br />Super cute<br />Surprisingly warm despite essentially being sandals.<br />Rubber bottom (Although I don't think I would wear them outside as the fuzz hangs over and would get wet/dirty.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Don't stay on my feet well while walking despite being my size.  But I see now that it says to size down..."
4.0,I like it  and fit great
4.0,I bought this at the same time I bought another kind of animal hat 3 in 1 and this is by far superior to the other one. It is not as nice as the $100+ animal hoodies but you can't beat it for the price Looks cute and is watm. &#34;Fur&#34; does not look cheap.
4.0,This is better quality than the previous one that I have purchased else where.  In general it does the job of catching the hair for some light trimming.  It doesn't bother the kids like the one i use to have which is a plus.  It's still pretty cumbersome to clean though hence the 4 star rating.
4.0,"A friend purchased this for me off of my amazon wishlist. I love the fit an the soft material. It’s flattering and could probably be worn in two sizes. I love the pockets! My only disappointment is the color. My favorite color Is green & this suppose to be “dark green.” This is more like tea. It’s still pretty but doesn’t fit color description. I would order ( and probably will) in other colors , but with an open mind it might not be the exact color shown."
4.0,Btw silver. Great gift.
4.0,Very nice sunglasses. Great for 60's costume.
4.0,These are great!! The only difference I wish there was is different length in belts. I have some chunkier kids that can’t fit them so it would have been nice to have a few longer ones with the kit.
4.0,"I liked the design of this although I carry so much junk that it was a little small for me. Only 4 stars because this kind of plether, while very common right now, wears out quickly. I prefer real leather for years of use, not months."
4.0,"I use it under my regular dress up shirts,they feed perfect,thank you.<br />  E .Ahumada.<br />  California."
4.0,"I used this bag while on a trip abroad. I needed something to stash everything in. It held up nicely.  However, the strap is shoulder strap is about 1.5/2 inches too long. It might be because I'm only 5'4, but the length was frustrating. I often had to hold it up and out of the way. Otherwise, it's a durable and sturdy purse."
4.0,Cute shirt.  Runs SMALL.  Colors are true to picture.  Grain of shirt going crooked in the back opposed to straight across in front.
4.0,"Nice mouse pad.  Be aware that it is shipping from asia, so it might take a few weeks to arrive."
4.0,Well made. Accurate sizing.
4.0,It’s a very cute jacket I love it for the kids please chose a bigger size for yourself if you were a xl them get 3-4 x but it’s a very good jacket I was able to give it to one of the teenagers haha they love it so really no complaints just the size
4.0,"Run a little big, but we’re exactly what we needed"
4.0,"Good fit, love the length and the lace accents.  Looks great under sheer and crochet tops."
4.0,It was good. The delivery was super fast. Appreciate your efficient service. The leather component of the belt was a little stinky but it could be fixed after a good dose of perfumed sprayed on it. Great value for money.
4.0,I love this top. Good quality. Fits as expected.  I wear a medium shirt and ordered a medium. This is very cute.  I would recommend.
4.0,"Great fit, soft fabric"
4.0,I really really like this suit.  Definitely runs large.  Normally a 10/12 so I ordered 8/10; still big in chest with some room in my hips and I'm all hips and tummy. I'm about a 34C and the chest-around is loose; I plan to take this in an inch on each side.  Cups are quite firm and don't stay in place but should fit better once I take in the sides.<br /><br />Had a hole in the side where the material didn't catch into the sewing. I fixed it up with about 12 stitches and am good to go.<br /><br />As expected for the price.
4.0,I used one time but i dont like the back string can’t bend down always stick up
4.0,Wish it had earrings to match it I saw the set with earrings after I already paid for this & I looked for the matching earrings to purchase none listed!<br /><br />The identical Set with matching Earrings is only $3 more then I paid for the necklace I was disappointed when I saw after I paid my order with 1 day shipping so I can wear tonight to show we are going to tonight!<br /><br />I really want to matching earrings I would have to return this necklace then order the Set so I can have the matching earrings I guess since it's only $3 more & you can't buy the matching earrings separately.<br /><br />I love this piece I rate 4 Stars for no earrings offered as a Set like I would have wanted vs just the necklace.<br />I have to try to find earrings that will look good with this necklace or return this & order the set for $3 more.<br /><br />It's a nice design nicely made 👍🏻<br /><br />Would Rate 5 Stars if came with the Matching Earrings!
4.0,"I got these stickers as covers while I got a sternum tattoo.  The did their job, but they're a bit paper and don't stick on flat over your nipple - so through tighter shirts or even shirt that just fall over your chest, it looks like you have folded paper over you nips/under your shirt.<br /><br />That said, they're pretty cute if you're not planning to wear a shirt with them.  They're pretty sticky so they stay on awhile, but not so sticky they're painful to remove."
4.0,"Very pretty dress, but a little loose in some areas of the body."
4.0,Overall fit is good
4.0,"A little bit cheaply made, however, for the price, it works!"
4.0,These gloves fit my hands snug like a glove should.
4.0,"Love the design of the top, however it doest seem to give any support"
4.0,"I love the way this dress looks! It looks more expensive than it is and I got a lot of compliments on it. The lace is stretchy which allows it to contour well to many body shapes. The only downside is that it did snag on literally everything it touched. I wore it once with a small purse and the friction between the purse and the dress left it fuzzy and pilling within 30 minutes, so you do need to be careful with it. It is also very long which was great for me but might not work for someone who isn't particularly tall. I am 5'9&#34; 130lb and a small fit perfectly!"
4.0,"Super cute. Super comfortable and worth the price! I give it a 4 stars because the pink color is so close to nude that it looks like yr naked from afar. So it does feel somewhat inappropriate. Other than that, they are super comfortable."
4.0,Very long!  Great for a tall guy.
4.0,"Nice material, very thin. Ordered a 2x because I read reviews about this running small. Fits big but I like it. Colors are very vibrant and pattern is beautiful. Would recommend."
4.0,"Very pretty ring. I bought a size 8 which makes it very versatile.  I can wear it on my thumb, index finger, and middle finger.  The package came earlier than quoted.  I ordered it on June 5th and received it on June 22nd!"
4.0,This shirt fits great nothing to complain about besides how it was packaged with it being in its clear package with a label slapped on it…I’m glad it wasn’t a gift for someone in my house because they would have seen it plain as day.
4.0,Products look like they are of good quality. I haven't worn them yet thought so I can't give 5 stars.
4.0,"I bought this to use on all of my jewelry (especially my Alex and Ani bracelets). I store my necklaces, bracelets, and rings on a hanging Jewelry organizer over my closet and several items get tarnished easily. This polishing cloth arrived quickly and was nicely packaged. I didn't notice the size specifications and was a bit surprised by how large it was so be sure this is the size you want. (12&#34;x15&#34;). It worked very well and left my jewelry looking shiny and new. My only issue is that the blue side sheds a bit. This might just be because its new but I'm not sure. Other than that, I liked this product as it did improve how my jewelry looked."
4.0,Nice I have worn a few times to class And they help up well
4.0,"Super cute! I ordered the 2 to 3T size for my 18 month old, wish it was bigger because this dress fits more like a 12 to 18 month. It will be ok for Halloween but after that it'll just be too small.<br />It is see through at the skirt area but it isn't an issue for me.<br />Super cute, felt it is very good quality for 13.99!<br />Would order again but just order way too large so it fits better."
4.0,"I actually like this dress quite a bit. I was apprehensive at first but when I tried it, it was pretty neat. It's a little snugged around your chest, if you have big breasts but a really good price for the dress. I liked it and it arrived just in time for the Xmas party."
4.0,"Really pretty dress. If you're tall it will hit at the ankles (5'6"", 185lbs, 36DD). If you have larger breast it will show quite a bit of clevage. Love this dress. Wore to a small wedding. It was a but tight under the breast area but I didn't notice it after a while. Light and airy."
4.0,"Very nice bag ,perfect size. Love the color combo."
4.0,"I am 5’5, 130 lbs. I ordered a pair of black medium, and they were a little too snug. So I sent them back for a large, and they fit great. Because of how much I liked them I ordered the grey wash pair in a size large, just got them and they’re too big! I took one star off their review because of the sizing inconsistencies, but overall I think these are comfy and cute."
4.0,Super cute and flattering. I’m 5’6 and 170lbs and i ordered a Large and there is room. Fits comfortably.
4.0,Great shirt but does run a little small--Juniors sizing so just make sure you know that!
4.0,"retains its shape, retains color, doesn't shrink too much, be sure to dry on LOW heat if you use dryer, otherwise hang dry."
4.0,"I purchased 2 of these belts a couple of years and they have served me very well considering I wear the same one everyday on my uniform. The buckle suddenly failed me recently be a pin falling out rendering the belt useless. I was looking for the length of the warranty on the website but I could not find one. The belts are cheap enough so I went to order just a buckle replacement, however, it was cheaper for me to order the complete belt using Amazon Prime. I would like Bulliant to state the length of their warranty. Common sense dictates that don't you think?"
4.0,Great fit for summer
4.0,"So cute, but not good for big chest because it doesn’t offer any support at all."
4.0,"This dress fits as expected and is decent quality for the price.  The arms a slightly tight and honestly, if I were smaller up top the placement of the lace circles would be very unfortunate.<br /><br />Overall, I will be wearing this dress as a guest at a wedding and it is perfect for that."
4.0,"Great little cloak. My wife and my relatives love it, so much that I had to buy some for other women in my family. It's soft, warm, fits well and is well made and not too expensive."
4.0,"The strap itself is very nice, good quality, but this item popped up when I typed in eyeglass strap for UNIVERSAL FIT. It does not fit the glasses that I bought for my mom. She is 82 with light sensitvity, and they were for a pair of glasses called COCOONS. Sadly, I will have to find her something else that fits. Otherwise, a very nice product."
4.0,"Buy a glue gun, too, and put hot glue on the inside. It's the only way they'll not slip unless your occipital bone is a hook.<br />I'm ok with them though."
4.0,I would recommend getting a different wand this one is cheesy. The rest is awesome. Tattoo's were not super easy to wipe off. My son loved it!
4.0,"I usually order a Medium in shirts, but this what a bit tighter than I like. It wasn't so tight that I could wear it, but I would recommend ordering a size up to get that flowy look."
4.0,"Very comfortable, just wish they had more color option for plus size."
4.0,Love it but its a challenge putting the screw in the clasp. will probably need some a assistance putting it on.
4.0,"For some reason I thought the string part would be attached already but when I received it, the string was separate and so I had to put it together. I’ve worn it a couple of times during winter and it also has toooo much static but overall got compliments."
4.0,"I bought this Nato to go with my new Orient Ray.  The band is thicker and more substantial than other Natos I've bought, but this made it a little stiffer as well, so it needed a bit of a breaking in period before it felt comfortable.  I knocked off one star because right out of the package, there were several spots were the stitches and/or heat welds were sticking out on the side that contacted my wrist, causing irritation.  I had to use a nail clipper and fine sandpaper to smooth them out.  I never had that problem with the other Natos I've bought from the same vendor."
4.0,beautiful very happy with this item
4.0,My daughter wears a 10/12 (10yrs old) and it fits perfect. Beautiful orange color. Hits right at or just above the knees.
4.0,"I give an extra gift to my grandchildren for their birthdays of underwear, and now they look for it and happy to get them."
4.0,My daughter knows I'm obsessed with the night skies and this was PERFECT! ❤❤❤❤❤
4.0,I really like the overall look of the rings however they're very small but you can adjust them a tad bit. I have very skinny fingers so they fit on certain fingers like my index and ring finger.
4.0,"I've purchased a lot of different styles over the last year due to lower leg edema of unknown etiology other than working behind a desk.  I wanted something bright that even I wouldn't mind wearing w/shorts and these kind of ""screamed"" out at me due to the vibrant colors.  The compression is what I expected and they stay up all day.  I was a bit sad that the deep blue pair were a size smaller but my drawer is filled so I'm not really complaining."
4.0,Bought for someone else but they run small so I ended up keeping them for myself
4.0,Love it but runs small! Very ward
4.0,"I really love this suit, I ordered a small, im 5'3 and 120 lbs and the top fits well for smaller chested people, so if you have anything bigger than a b cup your nipples will be on full display. the bottoms I wish I could have ordered a bigger size because im a little curvier and its basically a thong. cute suit though just not something ill be able to wear around the family since my entire butt is out"
4.0,"Very pretty purse, but it's very stiff, hard to get things in and out of it. Wish it was just a little better quality, but it's very pretty"
4.0,Cool backpack. Zippers are a little cheap
4.0,"Love the dress! Good quality, great stretch. Only lost on star for me due to the zipper under the arm. It isn’t necessary and the inside of it is irritating against skin."
4.0,Leakproof and anti fog. Tend to be uncomfortable on the nasal bridge even if wore loose.
4.0,"They are oretty, but the butterfly clasps are microscopic.  Need to buy comfortbacks in silver that are secure but easier to handle."
4.0,"At $31, I purchase this watch with low expectations, but I was blown away with how nice it really is.  Mine was the all black version and it was stunning to look at with black face, bezel and body  The watch face is beautiful with a 42.5mm bezel, but its size is muted by the all black face.  The band is beautifully tapered and appears to have solid links as well as solid end links.  The clasp works well with a safety button, but it is just stamped metal.  I'm not sure about the durability of the all-black surface treatment but it's very nice.  With a quartz movement, it keeps almost perfect time.  If you don't have a lot to pay, but want a quality divers watch, this watch is for you."
4.0,"No Sweat band. Nice mesh inside, looks nice."
4.0,It is very well made and is really cute. I wish it was a little wider. I find overall for the price it is a very good buy.
4.0,it was made well and I was happy with the quality but it was too​ small and too short.
4.0,Wife looks sexy as hell in it
4.0,"I recieved this order promptly with no defects. I really enjoy this pocketbook and the coloring is great when it's dark (looks like an oil slick) as well as when it's brighter colors. It fits great into the matching purse I ordered with it. And it has many compartments and is able to hold cards, cash, etc. without becoming bulky. I also enjoy how durably it is made.<br />The one drawback I see is that there is no small window card holder for an id and that with certain cards the pockets seem tighter, however, it is not impossible to get the card out.<br />All in all great."
4.0,Fits well in me.  I am 115lbs and 5'4&#34; tall.<br /><br />It's nothing spectacular but it's not a bad deal for the price.
4.0,"I really like the texture of this tunic shirt. It fits pretty close to size, but as to be expected it is very long. I am only 5'4&#34; and the back of the shirt comes down below my mid thigh. I knew it would be longer but the picture doesn't really depict that it would be that long. Not the end of the world but it is longer than I wanted. The texture of the shirt is soft, very cuddly and forgiving as well. It's comfortable to wear all day and allows you to move well. Good for work or for play, dress it up or dress it down. It works well for separate occasions. Washing, we did cold to make see no shrinking happened and it came out great. Looking forward to wearing this more often, perfect with leggings. I had received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"These are good workout tanks but I felt they were a little short for me. I like the longer tanks for working out so they don't ride up and show my stomach. The colors are great and the material is soft and breathable. They fit snug against your body like compression shirts. Overall, I like them ...I just wish they were a couple inches longer. I like wearing them under by cotton tanks so they absorb some of the sweat or if I'm wearing high waisted pants in case they ride up while working out. FYI - I got a large and I am 5'4, 155lbs, 36B, 30in waist, 41in hips."
4.0,"Very cute, the pearl on top looks a little cheap so I replaced it with a silver ball. Other then that great. Come very fast in the mail like 4 days"
4.0,"The skirt is really cute, it has a nice inner lining so you don't need to wear a slip. The material is really nice. Runs a little small so I'd size up."
4.0,"Nice cap, very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,I really like the style. I also like the flexible hinges. The only thing is the screws keep backing out. I lost a screw so that pair went in the trash. The good thing is they come with a tiny screwdriver. I know now to check and tighten periodically. I would buy these again.
4.0,It looks just like the picture. Bright and all. Very nice dress.
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised that this initial necklace looks so Nice (for the price). I hope it doesn't tarnish anytime soon because I plan to wear it often. I've even seen the person on TV with one on since my purchase.
4.0,The pants are very comfortable but they stretch out easily after one wear.
4.0,"These socks are purely functional anf are exactly as described. I wear a 7.5 women's shoe and the s/m fit perfectly. The socks are knee high on me and the compression is comfortable and warm. By the time I returned from a 35 minute walk in 70 degree heat my feet were very warm. After laundering they held their shape and were ready to wear. I plan to use these under boots since they really are not pretty, a huge ACE logo runs across the top of the foot part of the sock and is visible in non traditional sneakers. If shin splints or cramping are your running problem in cool or cold weather these socks will serve you well."
4.0,Very soft and comfortable. Not for walking in any distance.
4.0,super comfortable and fit perfectly.
4.0,I am satisfied with dress
4.0,A little small but other than that it is perfect.
4.0,"This is for the summer for my grandson to wear in the pool. From the looks of the product, they are good quality. I like the UV protection on them."
4.0,"I knew the top wouldn't work for me (I am a D, so I need more support then that) but I ordered these just for the bottoms to mix and match with tops I already had. I ordered an XL, and I usually wear a size 8. The size was perfect.  I love that it hides my stretch marks!"
4.0,They are not warm enough for the temps I live in but just as warm as any pair I've worn.
4.0,They look good just not the best material
4.0,Good band the fit perfectly for my husband's wrist
4.0,The exchange was fast! But Runs small and a little thin ….. the name it’s a little to big as well! If you are really skinny ok<br />I am 5”4<br />132 pounds<br />I got size  M wasn’t bag enough for me
4.0,"Love this outfit, purchased it for my vegas trip and I will pair it with heels. It fits perfectly and i still have alot of room in my midsection and bottom. once I put a body shaper on, its going to be even loose fitting for my midsection so i might adjust it just a little. wish there could have been an option to get an XL top and L bottom........... so 4 stars just because of that."
4.0,"Bottoms fit, top is too big."
4.0,Nice and perfect for my daughter's Halloween costume!
4.0,these are for my granddaughter and I am certain she is going to love them. Thanks for delivering what appeared online.
4.0,This dress looks even better in person.  was purchased for thanksgiving photo session and it looked amazing.
4.0,"Pretty thin material, but good for my purposes--as part of a Juno costume for Halloween. I ordered a couple sizes up to accommodate the baby belly and it fits well."
4.0,nice material fels good and i am very happy with this purchase
4.0,"Nice, very thin like nylons but worked great."
4.0,I love this. It has POCKETS!!
4.0,"Beautiful design, not much give. I should have went up a size. Purchase from here a lot so I know I'll get quality every time. These print clothes always turn heads!"
4.0,I'm 6 foot and a size 32 so it fits goodish. I have a longer back so it rides a bit in the crouch but nothing bad and I wish the hood wash bigger but all in all I'm happy
4.0,"Overall nice look, but clasp on bracelet does not stay closed"
4.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet, but the coloration is gold and not the rose gold that it shows in the picture"
4.0,"Fits Fantastic and very supportive, I plan to purchase another."
4.0,Does the job and looks fashionable.
4.0,This is lighter than I expected. It’s that waffle material. It’s cute. The arms are long and rather wide. I will keep it because it is a cute top.
4.0,"This set is not a baby light pink like the photo implies. It’s more like a neon peach-pink but, it is well made and true to size"
4.0,"Fabric hangs nicely,  I bought a medium based on my measurements and it was somewhat loose.  However, the company has been quick to respond to my review, and has satisfied me 100%!!!"
4.0,"This is NOT silver. More like a light cloud grey. The COLLAR is mostly silver, as in, it's the only part that looks right. In the pic it looks like a silver vest with a pewter collar; in reality it's a light cloud grey with a impure silver/pot silver collar. Size runs small, totally annoyed at the color. 4* because I'm not returning it and it's comfy, but this is NOT silver."
4.0,More bulky than it looks in pictures
4.0,"Very nice quality shoes, they get a little dirty, but pretty easy to clean."
4.0,"This fits very well. Would have given 5 stars, but it's not machine washable apparently..."
4.0,This is a cute outfit! Fits super cute however the pants are super long and the jacket is super small
4.0,I love everything about these glasses except that they are a little small around my head.
4.0,"Sneakers are really cute but really wide!  No half sizes so I had to get a 9 and they are enormous.  So there you have it, really cute but big and wide"
4.0,"Love the bag,however I prefer the canvass rather then the pvc,the size is perfect"
4.0,"Loved it, fit great, just straps stretchy nothing safety pins couldn't fix."
4.0,"I'm actually surprised this fits perfectly. Shopping for bras online is always hit or miss for me, but I'm pleasantly surprised that this bra fits so well. The only thing I have to say is that the band is a little tighter than expected because there aren't any hooks where you can change the tightness. The band will probably stretch out over time just like most bras do, so I think that won't be much of a problem.<br />I'm a 32D (sometimes 32C), and the 32D fits as expected just a little tighter than most bras. If you are in-between band sizes I would go with the bigger band size, for example if you normally wear a 34B, and you usually wear it on the first set of hooks, I would recommend going with a 36C. If you can deal with the slight tightness, stay with your size.<br /><br />This bra is lightly lined, so of course I would have liked a little more padding, but the back of the bra makes up for it.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,"It's very small. I thought it would of been bigger around. You can not wear it on your big finger, only on your pinky or the top of your finger. Other wise its cute, just to small around"
4.0,This is a cute shirt but it is smaller than anticipated. It is not like a tunic but more form fitting. But the shirt is really pretty because of the floral detailing on the sleeves. Overall it is a feminine show which I really like.
4.0,"I would have preferred more room in this sweater because I want to wear them with leggings and it clings a little too much to my rear. I am 5'2 and 120 lbs. Oh, well, it will give me incentive to lose my holiday weight."
4.0,I use these glasses to cut glare while Driving at night
4.0,"This isn't for tiny charms or any charms. It is more to be worn as it is. It can be worn by women or men. It is a study chain, and length is accurate."
4.0,Pedir un size más.
4.0,It's still ticking!
4.0,"They fit ok. They have absolutely zero stretch to them. They are somewhat comfortable but feel like polyester, not cotton linen. They could be larger in the thigh for air circulation. Probably will not buy them again. I will keep them because they are fine for around the house in hot weather."
4.0,Size is smaller than stated I even went up a size but should have gone up 2... Good quality.
4.0,"This dress is very cute but unfortunately was too small for me through the busy. I’m a 38DDD so I ordered a size up, but the bust did not give me enough room. It’s a cute dress but it wasn’t the right fit for me."
4.0,"I love this bag!  So great for going everywhere & carrying everything. A great mom bag, work bag, diaper bag...anything!  The reason I only gave this 4 stars is I was surprised there was not a solid bottom in the large compartment.  I thought there would be and for storing work papers, it flexes a lost more than I thought.  But I still love it!"
4.0,I got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter and I put it away and have no idea where I hid it!
4.0,The legs don’t stay up
4.0,"Great warm pair of socks, but be prepared to have oversized shoes to fit them in, they’re that thick!"
4.0,I received them earlier than expected. They are not standard size earring backs they are smaller then standard. I had to push to get it it fit my earring post. Overall for the price they worked
4.0,I like the product. It sealed well.
4.0,So this is a cute shirt and is good for all seasons with those longer sleeves.  I think I ordered a size too big but the flow did not look too bad.  Compliments were flowing and I felt good in this.  Definitely a good buy and am buying another
4.0,i wish i would have bought a pair with no diamonds down the side..other than that they are perfect and do the job... thanks again Amazon :)
4.0,"This is cute, but is extremely see-thru. I’ll be wearing it as a cover-up because it is adorable. I’m 5’10” 130 lbs (35bust, 26waist, 34hips). I usually wear a medium in dresses (4/6). This was short for me in the torso and pant legs but that’s understandable because of my height. I did like the adjustable straps so I could change it for my torso length. Very lightweight and thin. Not sure how it will hold up once I wash it because it seems like the kind of material that is going to shrink. Overall this is cute, but cannot be worn with regular underwear since it’s practically sheer."
4.0,"Can see through if you have larger arms, bust still fits."
4.0,"I like this dress despite the delay in Delivery. The material is very light and shows flaws.<br />I wear a medium but ordered a large based on other review and it fits fine. The length is a bit long, below the knee.<br />Overall I liked this dress so much I ordered another one in blue."
4.0,"Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas because he is a fishery biologist (big fish nerd). Him, his family, and I all got a kick out of it. He wears them around at his office at school. I think they're pretty cute. They are BIG and wide. He probably wears a 10 or 11 and it fit him fine. He said they were soft. They weren't to thick and sturdy so I'm not sure how long they will last."
4.0,At first I thought it didn't work because I couldn't find a button or instructions. I was going to give up but saw a comment that there is a button near the base of the horn where the on/off/try me sticker is. It's very small but I found it and gave it some clicks until the lights started going. Good luck.
4.0,But the seams are a bit itchy. I haven’t washed it yet so that may help.
4.0,This bra is super sticky and fit pretty much as expected. It’s a great deal for two bras!
4.0,Super cute and fun to wear. Especially on the thumb.  A little pricy for the item.  Average to good quality.
4.0,"great products, light and very soft!"
4.0,"Nice top, really soft material, but sized a bit small"
4.0,Hubby loves it. Colors and quality are good! Seems to be balding up well
4.0,"The top is a little flowy and not fitted but it’s great as a night shirt. The material is a little rough but good for the price and doesn’t bother me to sleep in. The clasp in the back was broken and I have to reattach it when I put it on but it’s no big deal. The shorts aren’t too short and they don’t ride up at all.<br /><br />If you’re looking for sexy, this may not be it. But if you’re looking for something cool, comfy, and able to be worn around relatives this could be it!"
4.0,"These were pretty large, but comfy! The string doesn’t do anything to tighten the shorts. It’s just long and meant to make a bow I guess, beware of that."
4.0,It's a good looking watch. But you've got to watch out because it winds itself with movement. My husband didn't wear it for a few days and the time kept getting off because he would forget to wind it and it would just stop and go (you can wind it by twisting the crown or with just your movement from wearing it throughout the day)
4.0,"OK so I'll start with my stats. I'm a 32DD in Victoria's Secret bras, I wear small bottoms. I'm 5'2&#34;, 26 waist, 34 hip (all in inches). I order the medium in black. I will say the material is a little bit nicer than some of the bikinis I've received on Amazon. The bottoms fit me perfectly; the top is the slightest bit small, but I am bigger chested. My only concern with the top is how well it will stay up when I'm moving around or in water, but again, I think that is only because I have a bigger chest."
4.0,"This is a great costume, and my son loves it. We bought a medium-sized adult for my 11-year-old son and it fits perfectly. He is not a big kid, these just run really small. The quality is not the greatest but it works for him."
4.0,Perfect! Loved these! Easy to wear for kids. My son is one and the only down side was we couldn't tighten them enough to fit him they were just a little loose. Overall wonderful product would recommend to anyone!
4.0,"The watch looks great, keeps great time and has a heavy expensive feel to it. Really good value"
4.0,Bought this for a roommate for party. He came out of the package looking great. I give it a quick steam but that wasn't even necessary.
4.0,"For the price, excellent dress!  Received lots of compliments !"
4.0,Very cute and adorable shoes. Looks just like the picture
4.0,My son loved them but they were too big and he was tripping over them constantly. Had to send back.
4.0,"Nice sandal, but it was a little smaller in the fit of the sandal"
4.0,Very sexy and classy at the same time easy to walk in for a high heel
4.0,"Great quality, light weight, and I love the click back closure. They were a little larger than I wanted, but that is just my personal preference. I would love a pair that are a little smaller in size."
4.0,Great necklace. Looks great with a lot of my outfits. Like that it came with earrings
4.0,The socks are nice however they run tight around the calf and doesn’t come up to the knee.
4.0,"Beautiful, but had to return because it was too large. Too bad they don't have it in a smaller size."
4.0,"Cool watch, only problem I have run into is that the crown covers have become stuck and I am unable to get them open.  I will be contacting the seller for assistance and advice.  Otherwise, this is a great looking watch for my collection."
4.0,Really cute and comfy dress.  The shoulders are really snug so it will stay up on you. Great quality and would buy in other colors.
4.0,it is small for what it looks like but I like it alot
4.0,Great comfortable shorts the fabric is very soft easily outclass other expensive brands. I have a muscular body waist 30 but short stature so I usually have problems with the length and fit so in my case I went a size up of my normal size if you don't want a tight fit I would recommend the same. The only cons a have is that it would be better if both hand pockets were zipped
4.0,"Hurt a little putting in but overall good purchase, just as described"
4.0,"My fault for ordering the smaller necklace, but it's fine. The clasp bent a bit trying to get it on, and it seems a bit shorter than 24&#34;, but overall it would be good for a lady."
4.0,"Oh, does it stink.  Wow.  Smells like radiation.  Laundry day is tomorrow and I hope I can rectify this in only one wash, but wow.  You will not wear this when it arrives.<br /><br />My PipBoy pants, conversely, got worn for 2 days out of the box.  Because I can do anything now.  Except wear the Vault-Tec shirt while playing Fallout 4 out of the box.  o_o"
4.0,Works fine. Fits great on an airplane without getting charged carryon fee. Just tends to fall over easy when full. And the handle doesn't lock when extended.
4.0,"I love the shirt and the material, but the fit is a little snug. I am usually a medium, but I ordered a large and it just fits. The length is great, though (I'm 5'9&#34;, so it's hard to find shirts that are long enough)."
4.0,"Great, can wear two ways!"
4.0,Shipped quickly and was exactly what my daughter was looking for!
4.0,"It is bigger than a credit card, but it allows you to have 2 cards in each pouch.  Also, the opening to the pouch is on the Outside, meaning it faces away from the flap that tucks in.  I worry that the cards in the first pouch (furthest from the tuck flap). could fall out when I open my wallet.  it does mean an adjustment for me since I had my openings on the inside."
4.0,"I don't think the product itself was a problem. I think that there's just no room for both my foot and the insole. Since I can't use it, I gave it four stars."
4.0,This fits nice and looks nice. I use it for office.
4.0,Super cute! Just as pictured. Material is soft and comfy. I have washed it several times now and it still looks great. Would recommend this one!
4.0,"Good for th price ,color fades little after 1st wash"
4.0,I'll like them this winter
4.0,I like it but would prefer a scoop or Vneck.  Somewhat sheer.  I wear a white strappy tank under it.
4.0,"It fit nicely, fabric has stretch to it and it flows really well."
4.0,I wish it had a softer shoulder strap. This one is a bit irritating due to stiffness and being only one thickness of heavier leather.
4.0,"great  glove just to small,  will send back"
4.0,"I like the longer brim to help protect my face from the sun.  I didn't like that the hats are packaged totally flat --folded in half. It's made in, and packaged in China, near as I can tell from the labeling. Leaving the hat dreadfully wrinkled. How do you iron the round part of a cap?? Maybe a few minutes in the dryer will help."
4.0,"Cute but some of the diamonds in the belly rings are loose and jiggle around. One of the balls was stuck on the belly ring and I can’t get it off to put in. Overall for the price, it’s a good purchase."
4.0,"This bracelet is super cute, but man is it hard to get on and off! It has a weird hook & loop system, but once you get the hang of it it gets easier. It's very cute, I've had a bunch of compliments. Beware it is easily bent. But I would definitely buy again."
4.0,"I ordered this for my lake themed wedding, and it is absolutely beautiful! the quality is amazing, the colors are gorgeous. Updating later, after I've worn it for 8hrs."
4.0,"Very pleased, just as advertised!"
4.0,"Nice ties, great colors. They are a little short for me but I made adjustments. You can tell they’re not silk but that’s okay. Can’t be super fancy all the time. Spilled some coffee on the light one and it washed out nicely."
4.0,"It's a nice hat, but a little too lose."
4.0,"This was a great christmas gift for my sister, she loves it. Good quality and arrived right on time."
4.0,When I opened this package I was afraid it was too small. I ordered the next size up right away and discovered I didn't need the replacement. The original coat fit correctly.
4.0,"The fit was great. The pockets are a plus, but the pockets felt a bit bulky. It sort of looked like I added some weight near that area."
4.0,I got these for migraine days when I have to come out of a darkened room (sometimes wear them IN the darkened room).  The over/wrap size was very important as my head is fairly large and having them squeezing my head would be worse than useless. I have found them very helpful.
4.0,"I really like these! They do not make my ears itch and are adjustable so that the bar can hang lower or higher under your ear lobe. They are very pretty and get many compliments.  The earring back is attached to a plastic disc, makes it harder for me to get my fingers around it. I accidentally grabbed the piece while fixing my hair a few times, it did not come flying off and held in place, not even overly painful when it happened."
4.0,It's cute but much bigger than I expected. The bottom part of the ring covers the entire belly button. And the top part that screws on is about the size of the normal bottom jewel. It's not subtle. Looks like a piece of glamour bling. Not bad if that's what you want. But I wanted something more simple to have in when running or spinning.
4.0,sizing runs a little small
4.0,I didn't know it had slits up the sides.
4.0,"Great dress with pockets.  The chest line cutouts, which are a nice detail, require one to wear a nude or beige bra as it tends to open a bit.  I am 5'7&#34; and weigh 140 and the medium was way too tight across the chest.  I like the cut and fit of the large and it is a lovely look with sandals or heels."
4.0,"I ordered this shoes for my 2 year old son & he likes them 😊 I think there nice as well, he's a size 8 but i decided to get size 10 & they fit a little big but he can walk just fine in them 😊"
4.0,Thick and warm. But I hate the drawstring at waist. It gets caught on things. Wish it had standard elastic waist.
4.0,"Product looks great and stylish.  My product came damaged, bent.  I straightened it out, I am guessing it was an isolated incident thru shipping.  I would recommend this product."
4.0,I ordered an 11 and it was a bit snug.
4.0,"Really like these running capris. Will just have to go down a size next time, as they run a little large and tend to stretch out as you wear them."
4.0,"When I put it on I heard the telltale sounds of popping threads, which indicates to me that it might not be very well made. I am not a large person by any means and it popped when I was only putting it over my head. It seems a little small, but maybe that's because I'm currently breastfeeding. The support is nice and firm though, I still think it will be nice for working out."
4.0,It is nice and soft and it runs true to size. I wear a small and ordered a medium because of other reviews although I feel the small would have been fine. The only reason for not giving five stars is the neck just hangs loosely. I would have liked it to be more fitted at the neck.
4.0,"Cute for kids , good value."
4.0,Cute. Wore it my Christmas party and received compliments. It may run a little big as I'm usually a medium but went with the small because Ive run into that problem before with a similar dress. But its curve flattering and stomach clinching which is always a plus.
4.0,"For the money it's a great value. I've been wearing the socks while running for the past month, they have held up well to both wear and washing - it should be noted I'm deployed to Afghanistan so the socks are under a little &#34;harsher&#34; conditions then may be normally expected.  I bought them expecting to throw them away at the end of my deployment but I don't think I'll need to.<br /><br />As noted in other reviews, they feel a little thin out of the package, but being a toe sock it works to their advantage if worn with toe shoes where you don't have the space or need for a thick sock.<br /><br />I experienced none of the manufacturing flaws as noted in some of the other reviews, they are a good quality and a reasonable fit (I wear a size 10.5 mens// 42 in five-fingers).<br /><br />The only reasons they got four instead of five stars is that the low-rise is almost too low; when wearing toe shoes (vibrams) the cuff of the shoe sits higher than the sock and due to the gap it causes a little rubbing on the ankle from the shoe.  Additionally, the second to last toe (neighbor to the pinky toe) is long, but that may be my feet and not the fault of the sock.<br /><br />Overall a great value when compared to other toe socks on the market and I would recommend them if you wear socks with toe shoes... they really cut down on the notorious &#34;five fingers of funk&#34; that so many toe shoes are subject to.  All things considered, I would buy them again without hesitation."
4.0,"I love the outfit but there were some little stains when it first arrived, but those were fairly easy to get out. The bottoms are very fluffy and soft so I enjoyed that, overall there great and I would 10/10 recommend! I recommend ordering a size up though seeing as the top is small"
4.0,"Very cool<br />Purchased for a glow in the dark party.<br />Added an extra level of fun to birthday kids experience.<br />I do wish they were lower priced as they are a novelty item, and not intended for every day wear/use.<br />I received a discount for an unbiased honest review of this product.My product was shipped on time and was well packaged."
4.0,Great accessory. Shipping was fast. Not real but they look nice. too many to wear all at once but great for mixing it up.
4.0,The flowers were a bit large but overall I liked it BUT didn't fit around my neck because the person who made it or company who made it didn't make the chain long enough to reach the other end to close it and it was so short. I have to now lengthen it with some more chain. :(
4.0,"I love the material of this dress. The waist sizing is off but the dress is made well. The right under garment will help.I love the color as well. I am 190 - 195 @"" 5 6"" and I ordered the 16. The mid thigh split is LOVELY. Bought this for my graduation pictures. I bought a white and yellow. The white one was balled up in the bag as if it was a return item from someone.  Its not White White either."
4.0,"Great looking watch and watchband with notable quality. My only complaint is that the push buttons have lost its stainless steel finish. I am also curious about the 39 day months that the display marks, WHY ?  Since I have many watches that I rotate, I have the inconvenience of having to set time, date, day of the week and month every time I wear it but on the other hand I save money on watch batteries with the automatic mechanism."
4.0,The wrong brand came... but it was a nicer brand so that's a win.  I ordered 2 more white shirts and they were a cheaper brand... so be prepared to roll the dice!
4.0,I bought this coins for decorating my night out bag. And I don’t want to spend too much money with brand name clutch if I don’t use it everyday. Then I found this pack of coins that is in my budget. I don’t expect the coins will be real one. Size is exactly like size on the bag said 29mm. Some of coins are twisted and not in a perfectly shape but i don’t mind to throw them away. Coin cames with one hole so i make another three more and i also bought jump rings to connect them together.
4.0,"I'm a little disappointed, because the pants they sent me was not what I ordere. Beyond that, the quality of the pant is good."
4.0,I gave this to my daughter as a gift: she loves it.  It was reasonable price and was described correctly on Amazon.
4.0,Me quedo muy grande el diámetro del cuello y se me cae la comida entre el babero y la ropa. Tendría que tener más cantidad de agujeros para poder ajustarlo más
4.0,II love the concept! I purchased these for my 3 year old because he really fights putting on gloves at all so the zipper design is awesome! The fingers are of course way long...but I knew that going into it. I could not get the gloves to zip about the last 2 inches but there is a Velcro strap that holds them closed past that anyway so I was just fine with the product for the price!
4.0,This hat makes a great gift an the led light works well with 3 settings great for walking at night an having Bluetooth is very convenient easy to remove light to charge remove from hat has a cover an you can connect to a usb line or your computer the Bluetooth needs just the one at the Bluetooth control an comes with a line to plug into it then to a usb
4.0,"Delivery was fast. I am 130lbs, size 6, and a Medium-sized was waaaay too small. Good quality, nice design. I had to give it to my sister, size 3, and it is a bit snug on her. Too bad, it is very cute."
4.0,This is a great deal 30$ about for 6 pairs of pants. They were a little too big mostly just because I'm only 5'1 and skinny but they fit well enough that they're still comfortable to wear and I still like my purchase a lot.
4.0,"slightly snug on the width compared to my steel toe pair of doc martens of the same size, good as long as i dont wear thick socks. Also the green glow part is peeling pretty early on wear the toe creases"
4.0,"This blouse is not so much cotton, but rayon. I would not wear this casually around my house, but maybe at work. Thin material, and not super flattering unless you are trim."
4.0,"Very durable bracelet that is good for male or female wearers. I wore this all the time, even in the shower and during swimming and this bracelet still looks new.  I bought this looking for pain relief as I’m 36 and starting to experience arthritis in my thumbs. Unfortunately after testing with extensive wear and then taking off, I did not experience a difference in my pain."
4.0,"The ring is very nice, it is just very flimsy and easily bent. I don't know what ring the person who said this was a heavy piece bought, but I think it HAD to have been something other than this ring!"
4.0,"Packaging was a bit dinged up, but product was perfect!"
4.0,Is a little short not as long as picture but it is really cute and the fabric is good quality.
4.0,"I bought the camo grey. They stay in place during a workout - no slipping. They have a great waist band - no cheap elastic. However, they are not completely squat proof... a little disappointed for the price."
4.0,"Its a decent watch band, though the leather laces can be a bit annoying at times. It also requires some good breaking in. As for the watch, it was okay quality, but I replaced it with a different face."
4.0,I love these! They are so cute. The seam is very noticeable down the front and back and they can be see through depending on the light and what’s underneath but overall super cute for the price.
4.0,Like the Glasses - Very clear and the blue tint is pretty sweet.<br />*4 stars as they do not wrap around as much as I would prefer as I got these for Bass Fishing.
4.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry that will be a reminder of the &#34;White Tree&#34; of Lord of the Rings.
4.0,It was a gift for someone and she loves it. I am thinking of getting one for myself... lol
4.0,Very good length and weight. Doesn't seem like it would blow upward at the slightest breeze.
4.0,"This tankini is the first I ever bought. The bottom in size M is just fine. The top fits fine too and I really like the print on it. However, I feel the bra cups could have fit better. Perhaps the top in size S and the bottom in size M, would have been the better match. Ah well, will manage with size M. Excited to check it out this summer, if it ever gets hot around here for more than 3 days in a row."
4.0,"Pretty ok for the price I paid! BUT the green is not as green as seen here, it's rather dull. Oh well!!"
4.0,Fitting is good. Material is warm. Received pair in proper packaging and great condition. But as these gloves are part wool and woven they seem to fragile and not really for rough use
4.0,Excellent choice!! Fit perfect and comfortable.  I loved
4.0,Fits good I like the material
4.0,"Nice holds a Lot!! . Mine smelled bad, plastic and mold sent to it. No mold in it of course, just stinky. A friend bought it from me and sprayed it down with fabreeze. She's happy with it."
4.0,"Fits pretty well, if you’re curvier be aware that as it stretches it loses color and becomes see through"
4.0,Soooo cute and a nice quality thick knit. I do wish it were bigger since it's a one sizer.<br /><br />Its pretty short. I'm 5'3 and usually wear a medium and this sweater is so short that I'll mostly end up wearing it with high rise bottoms. Definitely keeping it though. Would best fit an American size 4-8.
4.0,Runs big!!! Very adorable. I have a 17 month girl I got a size 5 they are veryyyyy loose. Just gonna load up the thick socks! Still great price and quality.
4.0,"Bought this for my Fiancé as a wedding gift It's exactly the type of watch he wanted, at an unbeatable price for a Seiko. Great Buy!"
4.0,the color is different than the picture
4.0,"Fits a little baggier than I expected, but I am pleased with it all the same. It is SO comfortable and totally my style!"
4.0,This top was not quiet right for my body type. The sleeves were a little bit too long. Overall I do like how the top looks so it's a keeper
4.0,"I love this dress I am 5 2&quot; 125 and its not too short, its a perfect it fit."
4.0,"I purchased a size small. For reference I'm 5'7"", 140 lbs. The length was good - which is something I struggle with regarding pants. The material is very thin almost like Pajamas but I am still comfortable wearing it outdoors. I ordered some other colors because it's an easy outfit to have to throw on around the house or running quick errands."
4.0,"I like the product! It is looks as expected. A tad bit tight in the arms. If you want a loose fit in the arms, i would size up one. I bought a large which is what i typically wear on a daily basis. Overall, good product!"
4.0,"nice quality socks, but very expensive"
4.0,"Cute hat, seems well made, but it was too small. My head is about 23&#34;."
4.0,good shirt for the price!
4.0,"They are perfect. The elastic in the back doesnt look as great as in the photo, but its ok."
4.0,"The legs are a bit big and it's a bit long for this 7 lb 2 oz (at birth) baby, who is now 7 weeks old.  Made for a chunky baby... : )  But the custom text was great!  So glad to have this option.  AND they delivered on time (unlike previous effort to purchase custom text onesie through another company, who cancelled my order!)."
4.0,Not quite as big as I thought. Its more tall than wide so I have to stack my stuff. Overall I  like it.
4.0,It is amazing quality. Good fit. My only complaint is the split up the back is so high that its literally almost to my butt. I got it to wear at the office but if I have to lean over for ANYTHING someone is getting a show!
4.0,"If you're debating between two sizes, get the smaller one. This has a roomy cut and is cute, if slightly on the thin side. I'd expect it to last a year or so before developing holes from regular washing. As promised, it's extremely soft and comfortable"
4.0,"The shirt fit different than expected. The model makes it seem like the shirt is meant to be long and a little baggy, whereas on me it seems average length and fitted. It is not skin tight, but doesn't seem to hang loosely on my body like it does on the model. The material was also different than what the picture looks like. However that being said I still really like the shirt."
4.0,"This is lightweight and professional looking so it'll be great in the heat this summer! It's a little big so I need to tighten the straps fully and the belt is a little awkward but overall, it's comfortable and looks good."
4.0,So far excellent sock.
4.0,"Got this as a gift for my BF, he is a mechanic and works around alot of noise but says the sound quality is good. He is enjoying the hat"
4.0,It's too big on my daughter's head but keeps her very warm. She'll grow into the hat so I'm ok with it.
4.0,"Love the product. The leather bracelet looks great! The deployment clasp is a bit uncomfortable, though to be fair, it’s more likely the cause of the mechanism generally, than this product."
4.0,I use it for my daith piercing. It’s a little smaller than I had hoped but it’s easy to use and cute
4.0,Warm even though doesn't have a zipper but buttons. Won't last long but can't complain at this price.
4.0,I wear an 8 in tops and dresses and ordered a large- perfect fit. I got so many compliments. The material is actually pretty thick and the shirt is just so cute! The only problem I had was that there was a little hole where the bell bottom and sleeve connected but nothing too major. Overall- great shirt especially for the price.
4.0,Looks fit a little large
4.0,Pretty but I have same complaints about the fit as most other reviewers
4.0,Very useful product
4.0,"Seamless, tagless, odor resistant, breathable, moisture wicking fabric. Available in XL or 2XL so that if you sit down the waist does not expose your butt crack if you are a little thicker in the glutes and thighs, or so the legs do not ride up. Not sure how supportive they are or durable because they were not worn yet."
4.0,I purchased these sunglasses for an Andy Samberg (Motherlover) costume and they were PERFECT. They look very similar to the ones Andy wears in the music video for The Lonely Island. Decent quality.
4.0,Great look . Very comfortable and durable . A bit hard to breathe though
4.0,"Very,very good glove keeps hands warm most of the day I'm in a -10 freezer and meat walk in box BUT NOT WATERPROOF They will get wet after a while other than that great glove thxs..,"
4.0,cute.  nice quality for 10$
4.0,This is cute! A little tight at the bottom but its still wearable. Cant wait to wear this in mexico
4.0,They're cute and funky. Unusual and for the more fashion forward. A good buy.
4.0,Its a thinner sweatshirt. Seems ok
4.0,Looks great on and it fits nicely-not too loose or too snug.
4.0,"I was looking specifically for a green necklace to try and pull in an accent color in a family photo. I don't have a big build, so sometimes big jewelry looks really silly on me and I was worried that would be the case here, but it actually looked really nice. I paired with a chambray button down shirt and it looked cute. It’s not fine jewelry or anything, but it’s a nice statement piece for the price. One thing I will say though, is that because I wanted a specific color of green, I ordered this necklace- called fruit green, and another one from a different seller called deep green--http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008NBWR1I/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />and THEY ARE THE EXACT SAME NECKLACE. Only this one was $2 cheaper. So I'd just order this one and save yourself a couple bucks."
4.0,Nice bracelet. My son loved it but it's too big.  Wish I could adjust the length.
4.0,I’ve been wearing these shorts for many years and have always been very happy with them.  Used to be made in Mexico. Now they are made in China. Seem to be good but have only had my new pair for a month or so. Time will tell
4.0,I love this mask but it looks quite different than the photos. Especially the mouth part is somewhat misleading. It fits my relatively large head (60cm circumference) OK but the chin is a little tight and my lower lip and beard are starting to show.<br />It is easy to see and breathe through it. Rubber is pretty strong but it does have that unpleasant scent. It was easy to put on and I have that It has a longer neckline that can be tucked into clothing.<br /><br />I can't wait to put this on this Halloween. I sincerely hope that you would find my review helpful.
4.0,This is a very nice hat and scarf. Unfortunately it is too small for adults.
4.0,A good band
4.0,Great product will buy more
4.0,"I loved the print it looked just like the picture. I'm 4'-11"" so it was super long for me. It also runs large. I could have sized down."
4.0,My original intent for this skirt was to wear it for my wedding reception but things change! Its beautiful and good quality. You will need to buy a slip because you can see through it. Elastic is tight. It was leaving me marks on my waist. Maybe a size bigger will help that.
4.0,I ordered this short to play golf in. It's s little snug but I can still wear it comfortably. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,love the sweat pants fits great a little long but i like the slouchy look
4.0,These pants run a little small. They are very nice. They are kind of like thick baseball pants. They do stretch.
4.0,"It’s really cute and great quality, just a little big"
4.0,"I am size 12 men’s, and ordering these in the 12, they are a bit snug with socks on and even without socks on. I suggest possibly getting a size larger than your normal shoe, if you want to wear cool socks with these"
4.0,Cute dress. Fits as expected and quick delivery
4.0,I gave this to her after her dance recital and she just lit up  It’s perfect for child or an adult.
4.0,"The first one I got had some weird lines on it (luckily they aren't too noticeable) but when I mentioned it, They offered to send me a new one which is very nice of them, so I guess we'll see how the next one is if they send it."
4.0,"A good price for these earrings, just a little more bulky than I had expected. They still look great."
4.0,my wife loves it... and me too
4.0,Regretting not getting it sooner
4.0,Me agrado que es liviano
4.0,Smallest watch I've owned but I wanted something smaller to fit easier when wearing motorcycle jacket and gloves. Overall quality seems good except the light which only shines on a 1/4 of the screen but very written that off as a quirk.
4.0,Loved the dress material and the fit
4.0,"Not exactly the material I thought it was going to be, but it's ok for the price I paid. Also, the pattern is a little different from the photos. I think it's because these photos are blurry. I'm 5 ft 0 in and it comes down to my ankles."
4.0,"I'm a busty girl so it fits slightly tight, otherwise it lays pretty- Drapes down to a little above the knee-"
4.0,"Soooooo disappointed. They were so pretty and the perfect size, the very first time I tried them on the back broke off and part of the base which got stuck in my ear. It bled some after I pushed it through but it could also have easily turned into a hefty hospital bill. I was really surprised after reading all the good reviews and very disappointed ..... put in for a return, guess I'll see what they say although it's yet another hassle .<br /><br />After getting a wonderful response from the seller I want to continue my review. All he asked for was a picture of the defective earring and is mailing me a new set as soon as possible. No hassle of having to mail anything back or argue for a refund. Will edit back to one star if the situation repeats but based on previous reviews, they were simply a rare defective pair and this new set will work out !"
4.0,Looking forward to getting a chance to go through and figure out how to use this nice and mixture of jewelry
4.0,I loved this dress but it was too small should have ordered a larger size
4.0,I use them when on our riding lawn mower and the noise is reduced significantly.<br />I think I need to tinker with the adjustment a little since my ears get a little sore after wearing them for long periods.<br />Overall great ear protection!
4.0,The vibrating alarm is helpful. I have it for my granddaughter and it keeps accidently going to military time. It should be harder to change the settings.
4.0,The material is softer than spandex and runs true to size . Blue was a bit more purple.
4.0,Very cute the neck hole was considerably large however
4.0,This latex skirt is very thin but not see through ...I’m 5ft 4inch ..167 lbs and I got a 39inch waist and a XL fit me very well ....can’t wait to wear mines
4.0,The fit great.  Beautiful colors and reasonable price.
4.0,Only dislike is that out of the package strong smell like tires but other than that looks great
4.0,Was fortunate to get this beauty on sale ! Plenty of room to organize belongings . beautiful craftmanship. Unique design. Love the color. The convenience of shoulder strap or hand carry.  Thank u for this lovely gem on a limited budget 😊
4.0,Very nice sleep shorts. Good value
4.0,Beautiful and classy. It fits well and is very comfortable.
4.0,This is super soft and fits perfectly in my pocket. I'm a teacher and keep my school keys on here.
4.0,"The belt strap was bent in the packaging and I'm still waiting for it fall normally even as I'm using it. The interior fabric is cheap and has childish but cute designs which is weird because the exterior is modern and a little old-ladyish. Did have a funny chemical smell when I opened all the packaging but I guess that's what you pay for when it's from China! Seems like a sturdy purse, worth it overall."
4.0,True to size; very cute top.  Buying one in another color!
4.0,"It's the 90's Casio I remember. Not totally waterproof,  wouldn't wash dishes or swim....but if you get water on it, it works fine. Screen is fragile, not for heavy wear and tear. Style points 100....durability about 70/100."
4.0,They were too strong for the computer but great as reading glasses.
4.0,I haven't had the chance to use them but they fit as expected. Seem to be good quality for the price.
4.0,I love this dress waiting on the right size to come then I can wear it's  beautiful
4.0,"I have used several anti-fog products in the past: paste, drops, and sprays. I prefer sprays as they are much easier to use and apply evenly.  At first, I was getting average results so I read the label again. Results improved when I sprayed the glasses directly and then used the cloth to spread and polish. This method provided a more liberal and better-distributed coating. Lastly, I also discovered that if I remove smudging and/or face oil from the glasses prior to the Anit-Fog, the results were very good, so much so the only time any fogging occurs is when there is a drastic temperature change. When this happens I swing my glasses a little back and forth and the fogging stops as the temperature normalizes. I understand that the directions have now been changed."
4.0,"It was very large on my son. It's made great. I had to get him another outfit ,it was to big on him and he is a 5t! So next year he will wear this one"
4.0,I bought this outfit for a friends baby.  It really looks cute on her.  It fits her well.  This was a purchase made at a discount or free in exchange for feedback.
4.0,My son loves these (he's 8) and takes care of them better than his Legos (which says a lot!).
4.0,Super fun mask. Good quality for older kid play - plastic holds up nice. “Collapsible” for easy storage. A bit hard to see through eye holes in moving around.
4.0,Very happy with this  vest.
4.0,Theyre super hard to get in. But otherwise very satisfied!
4.0,It's really great! My only complaint is that the strap isnt as long as I expected( I like my wallet to be at hip length) but that can be easily fixed with a key ring or two. Also it has a lot of slots for cards and it can hold a lipstick or two but depending on the size of your phone it may not fit in this wallet with a lipstick. I have  had to compromise on what to put in this wallet.
4.0,"I am a size 18 and ordered a 2x, and it is slightly too big. I probably would have been fine with a 1x. However, it's so cute on and the fabric is soft and flowy! I love the way it looks on me. The straps are not adjustable so if it's too large it can cause the top to hang low on your chest/back."
4.0,Top is weirdly shaped if you don’t have a super perky chest. It falls down and the material stretched quickly therefore creating gaps. There’s no elastic under your boobs. still looks cute but don’t wear it if you are worried about an accidental slip.
4.0,Exactly what I ordered great for table decoration will buy again
4.0,The picture she’s that the frame he’s down to the chin. It does not. It goes just under the lips. It is smaller than I expected but it seems it’s going to work better then the mask fabric sitting on your face if you have anxiety being covered and/or have trouble breathing. It’s not fantastic but it will help for short periods of time.
4.0,Very nice cargo pants. Fit nicely. Good weight; not too thick or thin; just right. Goldilocks would approve.
4.0,"I love them. Great size and shape. They are very light , easy to work."
4.0,I bought this as a gift. My friend was very happy with the necklace. It arrived on time and in new condition. It was a great deal . It is tarnish free and nickel free. My friend loves it because she won't break out in hives when she wears it.
4.0,"I love the earrings accept one fell apart.  Will have to get it fixed at a jewelry store.  Luckily, I didn’t lose it."
4.0,"It is an attention getting  piece. Watch works, though sometimes it takes a few tries to wake it up. Mine came with perfect instructions in english."
4.0,"I got the aqua.  Pretty color....Should have bought the small, tho.  I am going to try to cut off some of the excess. I do like it!"
4.0,I like these pair of shoes; they perform well and got good ventilation. Price and quality are right.
4.0,"Well made and adorable, my Grand Daughter loves it"
4.0,Liked it but 1 size too small.  Had to return.
4.0,Will give it to my friend
4.0,"This is good if you want to only carry 4 or 5 credit cards and some cash. I wish it were just a 1/4 inch or so longer though. As is, US Dollars fit snugly and more than 5 bills is a problem. Leather is excellent quality. I highly recommend these visconti wallets."
4.0,"I just received my drawstring backpack today, and was not disappointed.  It is lovely and appears to be well-made.<br />I would not recommend using it for computer or books or other heavy items.  It is a purse.<br />I, also, read that several reviewers thought the back pack was smaller than expected.  Mine actually measured 12.5"" wide x 15 Long"".  (the description states it is 13.5"" x 15.7"" , so, yes, it is a tad smaller.)<br />It is nicely lined and has an inside zippered pocket for small items.  I would have liked an outside pocket for my cell phone, but that's not a deal breaker.<br />All in all, it was a good purchase."
4.0,"Loved the dress for the first few wears, but starts to fade quickly. Not dreadfully so, but enough to notice that it looks worn. Be prepared to show MASSIVE CLEAVAGE though...... Holy boobs! I wear an A cup and I'm telling you what, this thing makes them look waaaaay bigger than they are in a push up bra. I can't imagine how much it would show on already busty women."
4.0,"Really like how it looks. Almost a small fit, but I think it is meant to be that way with he sleeves."
4.0,"Overall I was pleased with the scarf.  The background was a little darker than the picture, but still very nice."
4.0,"Quality, comfortable pants.  Wish there were more colors;  runs quite a bit large so reordered in a smaller size"
4.0,"This hoodie looks great and is super soft, came to me quickly. It does run small though. I got a large when a medium was suggested, and it fits super close. So get a few sizes up!!"
4.0,"Sleeves too long, collar to high on the back of the neck"
4.0,I bought this for my spouse and she likes it. I also like it because it enhances her beauty. You cannot actually beat the price with such a beauty enhancer. I recommend it for all women.
4.0,"Nice looking shoe. Was a gift for a friend, said they felt good. Now Id like a pr."
4.0,a little too much room; but does what it should
4.0,a little big but cute
4.0,I like the bags. The sizes are pretty good. But the zippers are hard to use at times.
4.0,"The shorts are not as tummy-controlling as some others I have, but they are comfortable and stay in place when you move around. They are also stretchy, which is nice. I was afraid they would be too small, but I ordered one size up, and it fit perfectly. Overall, I think these are great, especially for low to medium impact workouts."
4.0,Fun sunglass.  Wish they were darker that's all.
4.0,"But... I ordered a large and an ""L"" was stuck on the tag. Inside, however, an ""M"" was sewn to the label, so I measured the jacket and compared it to my husband's other jackets. This close to Christmas I have to wait until then to see whether it will fit my size ""L"" husband. Anxiety producing."
4.0,Pros:<br />Beautiful!<br />Steal boning in front only<br />Laces fairly easy to do yourself<br />Extra panel behind lacing<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very top lace irritates under arm area<br />Unless you're in the ibtc you'll have an issue finding the same size to accommodate your waist and breasts
4.0,"This ""Gaiter style"" covering was not rated well for Covid protection, however, if you double up the thickness when wearing it improves greatly. Very comfortable and Easy to wer."
4.0,Good hat a tad small
4.0,"Neck strap a little shorter than average, overall good though."
4.0,My son wears a size 8 ordered a 10 just barely fits
4.0,"My only complaint is the fit. I am tall and slender and usually wear a small or medium, so I ordered the large (correct size according to the chart). It fits pretty well lengthwise—though the legs of the romper look a little short on me—but around my waist it looks big. This might be due to how the fabric pulls with my more hourglass shape, but I will need to take it in about 4&#34; in the waist for it to fit well. No big deal for me because I can sew, but it may be for others.<br /><br />The part I really like is that the open crotch isn't obvious. The opening is plenty big, but it fits in such a way that it doesn't show unless you want it to.<br /><br />I ordered the blue and the color is beautiful, though more of a royal blue than the picture looks."
4.0,Items was as advertised but missing carabiners
4.0,Love the pants but I am 5’4 and they are a little short.
4.0,"This beautiful silk scarf arrived in a box suitable for gifting.<br /><br />It's very chic and feels amazing on the skin, cool and breezy, like that Windsong perfume commercial.<br /><br />I acquired it because ""headscarf"" is in the product description, but it cannot serve as a headscarf because it is too narrow.  As a silk headband yes, but not to wrap your head to cover your entire hair.<br /><br />I'll probably tie it to my purse handles to give it a posh touch."
4.0,"It is beautiful! It rests on the body perfectly. It does contain glitter.. Which falls off very easily, but if you can handle that, it's very pretty. The top layer is a ner type material, the glitter sticks together do you have to stretch it out to reveal the designs. It can come across as a bit costomish. But if bought for the right occasion, it can be perfect. This was bought for a winter formal. The star/snowflake design is perfect. Very light weight. Follow the measurements guide! My daughter fell in the middle of 3 sizes, so we picked the middle of the sizes and it's perfect. Will serve our needs well."
4.0,"I’m a 40ddd, heavier set short chick 5’4”... middleaged chickypoo.  I have dresses like this but maxi length - they are great with a short sleeve shrug too... but maxi is long and gets hot. These are lighter, shorter, cute,  with my BIG boobs, but and hips, they fall a few inches above the knee. I have thick thighs and they look good, except that part beige you get to the knee lol.  The dress falls well though... so I’m not freaked out lol.  The electric is stretch wide on my boobs at a 2X, but it doesn’t look like it’ll tear.  If I was wearing a white dress, I’d be a little more concerned about it with the lighter color and stretching,  I could probs go to a 3 x, but the rest of the dress would look too moo moo if I’m upping just to accommodate boob size.  For 4 inexpensive dresses, not bad at all. I wouldn’t pay $15 for each of these dresses, but the set price isn’t bad<br />THAT SAID... I’m taking a star off for the one pattern... I wasn’t stoked about it to begin with but wanted to be pleasantly surprised. Well, it was worse than I expected.  It’s the black one with the huge tropical flowers. Ugh... there is absolutely no place I would ever wear this one. Not even to take the trash out at 1am.  Nope.  Doesn’t even match up right at the places it should.  ITS HORRIBLE.  Awful.<br />FYI the reddish pattern is more of a red/white l/blue.. with green... kind of? I can’t explain it. It’s like a dark dark navy.  Not what I expected but cute.  I have an understated, cool (literally)4th of july dress now. 😂<br />Btw, not that you need to, but I bought a KILLER strapless bra from amazon for this... in my true size HANSKA or something.  It stays up perfectly and works amazing with this dress."
4.0,nice just like picture and fitted great
4.0,These are super comfy and appear flattering when on.  They are easy to move around in and lounge in as well.  The only drawback to me is their overall appearance.  I do not like the little accents near the bottom that make you look like you have eyebrows under your butt.  I think if it was a single color...they would be great!
4.0,"Nice i like it, bigger than i thought but still great"
4.0,"When I saw these glasses I got really excited. I am a huge fan of cateye style sunglass and these definitely caught my eye with the floral embellishment. When I received them I was immediately impressed with the quality of the sunglasses themselves. I have had many sunglasses over the years and these were made well and comparable to some higher end name brands I had purchased from before. I was slightly worried that the floral embellishment would make them look cheap in person, because the photos make it somewhat difficult to tell if it is actually metal or just plastic. But honestly I was so impressed. The floral detail is actual just that, very detailed and done delicately, it actually gives the glasses an even more Victorian feel. The cateye shape is gorgeous and the darkness of the lens is perfect for day time use. They aren't incredibly dark but do a their job. The arms of the glasses are thick and strong. Really nothing about these glasses are cheap or flimsy. They came in a nice protective pouch as well, which is always a bonus for keeping them scratch free. This would have received a 5 star review without question, but unfortunately they are on the small side for me. I guess I have a wider face and so they are a little tight on the sides at my temples and the frames are just slightly small for my face shape personally. I will still wear them and love them, but if they were just a tiny bit larger they would have been absolutely perfect! I definitely would recommend these to others and can see getting a lot of compliments on them.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I was in no way compensated for a positive review. I am a consumer just like everyone else and I often refer to product reviews to assist in making purchase decisions. The items I review are also all items I was already wanting to buy and use on a daily basis."
4.0,"I use these for my regular shoes, just because I hate tying shoe laces and they work great. Enough length to tie them interesting ways. I would buy again."
4.0,"I got the dress in a size S and it fits great,but the arm holes are too big/long. So I had to sew the straps up a lil to have it fit better."
4.0,"No complaints..you can wash them, iron them if you want...no dry cleaners! they fit just right and look nice on..love them..I got two pairs!"
4.0,"Getting the exact center height was crucial as I need to fit my 6'6"" truck under it. There is not one inch to spare and I think it's a little lower than specified."
4.0,"Nice skirt, flows fully and the heavier material<br />creates an A-Line look and feel. The material can't be ironed due to the material and the likelihood the material will burn. In that case, how do you get the wrinkles out of the skirt?"
4.0,My bad for not reading description. It is a sheer material! But it will be fine for a more dressy look!
4.0,"Looks super nice, the patch is just a little loose, I had to reinforce with a couple more ​stitches."
4.0,Hugh don’t go by size xhart
4.0,Nice and looks fancy but I have some problem my wife wrist is little small and this is big wrist in size. I still need to fix the adjustment so she can wear.The quality is great and she love it so far.The price is not too bad.Grab yours too.
4.0,"Material is not thick like the clueless movie. But it is nice for the price. I like it, just a thinner material. Still beautiful tho."
4.0,My daughter absolutely loves these socks. They are soft and very comfy.
4.0,"Cute, my niece loved it."
4.0,Cute and surprisingly sturdy.
4.0,Suit is very nice and a great buy for the price.
4.0,Smaller than I had imagined...looks more like a charm.
4.0,"I purchased this sweater to wear to church for a choir cantata. I do not normally wear whites or creams due to having dark hair - white washes me out. So, I purchaed this sweater based on the price and not wanting to spend a ton of money on something I knew I wouldn't wear when not required.<br /><br />The sweater is soft and not sheer. It worked perfectly for me, and I would recommend it to a friend - or you."
4.0,"Laces make it easy to slip into sneakers/hightops. This is my 2nd purchase of lace, but 1st for metal ends. I like the original plastic stops for these laces."
4.0,"I got what is described, so 4 stars. But friends; 5/16 of an inch (like my piercer told me I should get when I'm ready) is VERY SMALL. If you want it to look like a continuous hoop, you have to feed it first through the inside of your nostril. Which is REALLY HARD WITH AN ITTY BITTY HOOP LIKE THIS. I was able to feed it through the *wrong* way, and I saw that it would have fit all the way around beautifully , if it weren't a TINY HOOP, and I coulda got it in my nose how I wanted.<br />I'm not going to try and get my money back, because they gave me what I asked for, but I HAVE to buy some other kind of hoop, because I asked for something that I shouldn't have gone for."
4.0,"worked well for my purposes, very nice look, went well with my bracelet, not for rough treatment, probably wouldn't hold up"
4.0,"Cheaper than the Apple branded one, and just as appealing."
4.0,"Perfect fit, would buy this or similar product."
4.0,"Casual, comfortable, great value for the $"
4.0,"Overall, I like this hat.<br />There are a few things I would change though.<br />First, the brim is a little on the floppy side. I can imagine that with extended use, it will become even more so. This will not only be a nuisance as it will affect visibility, but will also make the bug net a little less effective. I would recommend adding a very light stiffener of some sort to prevent this from happening, (extra fabric, extra stitching or a very thin plastic sheet).<br /><br />The nylon material that the hat is constructed of is not particularly breathable, and the permanently attached bug net is stowed in the very top of the hat...what this means is that when its really hot outside, your head kind of cooks...there's no where for all that heat to escape.<br />It would be great if: A. There was mesh, or more vent holes on the side of the hat, or B. The bug net could be removed to allow for less fabric up top and more air flow.<br /><br />The nylon fabric of the hat is quite lightweight. It hasn't rained since I recieved it, so I've been unable to test the water resistance. However, if it does soak through my bet is that it will dry very quickly.<br /><br />This ""boonie hat"" style is my favorite type of hat to wear outdoors. I own 4 or 5 other hats similar to this one, but they are all made of cotton, or cotton/poly blends. These hats do a great job of keeping the sun out of your eyes and off of your neck, face and ears as well as absorbing your head sweat.<br />They are also outstanding in wet conditions as they redirect water off of your neck, face, ears, and keep large hoods out of your field of vision. Although, once saturated they take quite awhile to dry.<br /><br />I am going to wear this hat on my next backpacking trip. I am returning to an area where I was previously swarmed by mosquitoes, (in fact, that was the impetus for me ordering this hat). I am excited for the bug protection as I really hate slathering all of my exposed skin with bug repellent!!<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent hat.<br />Make it a bit more breathable. Give it a little more rigid brim. Make the net removable.<br />And you've got yourself a winner!<br /><br />For the price though, a bargain.<br /><br />Also, they included a couple of free pairs of cotton socks and a very lightweight, synthetic ""Buff""-like head wrap along with my order.<br />Nice touch!!"
4.0,These were a huge hit as a party favor for a child's birthday.  After the party a friend even sent me a video of her kids dancing and doing a light show.  The only downfall is that as you may expect they are not made to be very durable.  They die easily.  They are bright and  a lot of fun while they work.
4.0,It's always hard to find a shirt that will fit around my neck. This makes it much easier. Collar not too tight and making the shirt unbearable to wear for extended periods of time.
4.0,Quality work. Not typical size messenger but great for daily use. Similar to a fanny pack size but flatter.
4.0,I am always in-between L and XL no most clothing.  This seems to be have a slight modern or slim-fit so I went w/ the XL (6'2&#34; and 210 w/ a 42&#34; chest) and it fits nicely...Otherwise it is nice change of pace for fitness apparel.  like the material and style a whole bunch!
4.0,Bought it to fit IPhone 7+. Fits perfectly. Well organized.  Good for when you don't want to carry a big bag.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, the fit was not right for me."
4.0,"It is not the best of material, but it does the job. It came on time and worked great for ice skating competition. It does run a little small (child is a size 8, we got 12 to grow into and fit him like his size 8s)"
4.0,"They came lose .... but they ran a bit small, so for my 4 year old granddaughter I got her size 5."
4.0,This band fit too loose however I have a tiny wrist
4.0,"This is a really nice leather bag, very soft and good quality it just did not fit my needs so I had to return it. I would've love to have kept it but b/c it wasn't exactly what I needed I had to return it."
4.0,Cute design. Easy to clean. Easy to read. Our 18 yo daughter loves it! I'd purchase it again!
4.0,Some reviews listed this scarf as being short but I found it's length to be perfect.  I'm very happy with this purchase and will likely purchase scarves for other holidays.
4.0,When I tried it on I thought it was a bit too small but people seemed to like the way it fits on me.  I have just lost a lot of weight so I am a bit self conscious about things being too tight.  Great price for something no one else has
4.0,I like the material.Very soft and launders very well
4.0,Really nice.  the right size.  It is exactly what I expected.  I would recommend to others. I attached to one of my bags and it looks good.
4.0,My new go to everyday comfortable t shirt bra. I sized up and I’m glad I did for comfort reasons.
4.0,"Super cute, nice quality material and not see thru or sheer like many comparably priced (t-shirt type) dresses. My only complaint is the pockets, most seem to like them I think they are annoying and the only unflattering part of this somewhat form fitting therefore flattering dress. I like how this dress is loose yet has a bit of a shape and not so &#34;box like&#34; or &#34;maternity&#34; looking. I am almost 5'6 and weight around 130 maybe just under and a small is perfect.. it's also a lot longer than the picture almost too long for my personal preference but not quite."
4.0,"But this on a whim and ended up wearing it for family pictures. It’s super cute but probably but only wear a handful of times. It is a little on the thin side, but really pretty and photographed well. I ordered a small (I’m 5’3 125) and it fit well, but a little snug.  The back was lace up, so it was a little bit adjustable. You do have to lace it up yourself (I had to use tweezers!) so that took some time. All in all very happy with my purchase."
4.0,I ordered small size but waist part is little bit loose for me. I can put my fist in between. I normally wear 26 inch-pants and small size of gym leggings from other brands.
4.0,I really love the color of this bag .. and looks very classy just wish the handle was longer ..
4.0,Looks exactly like a movado... but the hour hand was not moving when I received it.
4.0,Exactly as pictured but they could be made from something softer since they are PJs
4.0,Material is thinner than I expected but very cute and comfy
4.0,Much warmer than I thought.  I can only use on early morning rides here in LA.  However quality is nice.  Don’t expect spandex style material.  Good (winter) kit for the money
4.0,"This dress/romper is absolutely beautiful, but unfortunately it didn't fit me. I would recommend sizing up because the chiffon type of material means it doesn't stretch at all. I loved the look of it and found the quality of it to be very nice, but I just couldn't get it to zip up all the way on the sides. Also, I noticed that it could be somewhat see through so you definitely don't want to wear any dark colored undergarments under it because they will show through. Still would recommend this though, as long as you size up to get the best fit."
4.0,"Great Jacket!! It was a little bigger than expected, but always hard to judge what will fit kids."
4.0,Very thin pins hold the strap on. Also wish the hand glowed.
4.0,Nice feel but they are supposed to be seamless and they are not seamless
4.0,"It is pretty long, but I'm happy with that. Sometimes the zipper on the side catches my skin or underclothes, but it really does fit nicely. It looks exactly the same as the picture. Worth the splurge!"
4.0,"Great color. Should have looked at the size and ordered it smaller (I have a 7-in wrist). Very comfortable, not stiff at all. Perfectly snapped on."
4.0,Exactly as shown in the pic
4.0,Unacoo size L kids capri sweats. Good fit and comfortable thicker crop pants. These have pockets which is great. They do have a tighter waist band and no drawstring bhb it other than that they fit good. The material is different like sweatpants material mixed with a synthetic knit maybe not quit sure how to accurately describe it. These do remind me of toddler sweatpants as another reviewer has mentioned. Good quality nice fit  and a heavier material kids like them.
4.0,Nice shoes that my godson can grow into.
4.0,These boots didn't come up as high as I like but they are very cute. They are warm inside as well.
4.0,Decent- happy with the number of rings in this pack. Wore one of the dangling designs first and it broke off right away. Still will wear the shorter ones though.
4.0,"I really like this dress. I’m 5’6, 165 lbs, 40C. I ordered a 2XL and it fits more like a 14... it’s roomy as I was hoping. Beware.... if your arms won’t fit in a long sleeve size 12, you may want to reconsider. The fabric is a heavy cotton/linen blend... This is not a spring/summer dress...I got the red Ann’s it is true to the pic."
4.0,I have washed this nightgown a few times and I am finding the fabric a bit stiff and not that breathable (so it is a bit too warm); I am not sure it was worth $50.
4.0,"The fingers are too long, gave them to my sister who has longer hands"
4.0,"I use this bag for my water, yellow vest, yellow work hat and my aloe. It’s a great bag my only dislike is that when you shoulder it the top unzips a little. I very much recommend this backpack. Btw it asked me if it’s water proof the short answer is no but for my needs that is fine."
4.0,Really love this shirt but beware if you have big boobs like me. Also is pretty short
4.0,"Loved these cute earrings, however, both posts were severely bent and I had to use tools to gently bend them back out straight. Should probably be packaged better. Maybe in a box instead of mailer envelope like they came in."
4.0,good look love it
4.0,I am 18 I have been color blind my entire life until the moment I received this in the mail from my parents as a Christmas present! This made me see the value in color much better before it was good but now with these glasses my vision is perfect thank you to PILESTONE so much! Thank you so much for bringing color to people! I am also an artist and its hard for me to see colors but now I can see without having to ask what colors such an such THANK AGAIN!
4.0,"It is really pretty, but it is bent really weird. Like the ring is oval shaped and I'm scared to bend it as I am afraid it might snap."
4.0,"I am a 40DD in Bally and Maidenform bras and I bought this in a40DD. It fits great for a fitness bra. I love the additional clasp giving more support. It is made of great material. I went for a 2 mile jog/walk and was happy, I ordered another one. I would buy this again."
4.0,"Wish this shirt was a bit longer. I'm trying to loose weight, so maybe I'm just being self conscious. Its soft though and feels good everywhere else."
4.0,Like the dress thought it was longer than it is
4.0,"Overall, a great value!  I've gotten several compliments on it, but I wish the frame around the face wasn't so shiny.  The only real problem I have with it is that the date knob occasionally gets bumped and the date changes."
4.0,"I really like these bands. They fit perfectly and are comfortable against the skin.<br />Only reason it only gets four stars is because the fabric is a material which threads rips out easily and then it looks like one white thread is running through the black fabric (like, if your cat does the claw thing right where your wristband is at). It's a minor annoyance, that's what it is.<br />But, I can fit the band around my ankle, which means I can still wear my sports watch at work (no jewlery/watches etc allowed - unless it's hidden by the uniform)<br />And if you please, you can sow your own scrunchie in a different fabric, the most important part is those pins you get."
4.0,It's awesome with pettycoat.
4.0,"These look great, arrived promptly and very Stylish!"
4.0,Love the bunny ears! Great inexpensive costume
4.0,"product lenght fit as expected, but width is wide."
4.0,Cute and so comfy!! This dress is well made and the material is so soft. The pockets are a bonus.
4.0,Its a good deal for me. Will observe quality of item against my old timberland work boot.  My old timberland took 1 year before it gave up.
4.0,A good value
4.0,The right hat for my grandson.
4.0,"It's a bowtie. Not the best material, but it'll suffice."
4.0,Good looking and good quality and good price.
4.0,Awesome band just the valcro is not long enough and gets caught in everything
4.0,"I really like this piece, I will order from seller again."
4.0,This dress is super cute and perfect for summer. I am on the busty side so wish I would have ordered up one size as it has a tendency to show off the girls too much for work.
4.0,Just FYI - the print can come off when the bracelet is wet.
4.0,"Great Value for the price. Nothing special to it, they are pretty much the same quality of the store bought, but much better price."
4.0,Bought this shirt as an impulse but it looked better than in the photos . It is actually worth the money. The material is very good when  compared to the price it is being sold for.<br />The only minus is the dots on the shirt which is a little flashy.<br />I bought black dotted one
4.0,"Pretty not large, goes with a bracelet I have."
4.0,Looks great on my LG Urbane! Very easy to attach. Nice quality build. Love the leather smell!
4.0,Smaller than I thought but not by much. Using for 20lb bad potatos we will see
4.0,[[VIDEOID:a4775231e6b95bbf9ee610b8d7178084]] I litterally just got the white and black ripped jeans and their is barely any whit in the ripped part so that was kinda annoying
4.0,Skirt is a bit longer than the picture but overall pretty ok
4.0,"My son love his Ryan's pjs but they are only good for summer, way too fresh for winter nights"
4.0,They are very sturdy and look just like the picture.
4.0,"Cute, not bad for the money"
4.0,Fits well and comfortable.  Quality is not the greatest but you get what you pay for.
4.0,This is a cute belt to wear on the outside of sweaters. I normally wear a size 10/12 in clothes and so the belt only loops once for me. So if your a little bigger don't expect to be able to make the cute loops that are pictured.
4.0,Can be a bit hard to get used to putting it on.<br />Dries pretty fast.
4.0,"No surprises here, fit and aesthetic as it appeared online."
4.0,"Really cute and good quality. However, it is a little bit smaller than expected though."
4.0,"This swimsuit is true to size, at least it was for me. I weigh 130 lbs, 5'9 tall and wear a size A cup bra and a size medium (5) bottom. The bottoms are what make this set as it is cheeky and shows more skin.<br /><br />The top fits great. As I mentioned I am very small chested and wear A cup bra (32.5in). There was plenty of room to tie across back and neck. It also has the different look to it with the material hanging down. It came right above belly button area and moves when wearing it. It has a nice flow.<br /><br />The bottoms have really long strings on the sides, so I might have to trim them up a bit. It is low cut and very cheeky which gives it that sexy look. The back have a ruffle look in middle that I think is very sexy! I measured my hips at 38in.<br /><br />I really like this swimsuit. If you're looking for something not cheeky than this wouldn't work for you. I like it! 4 stars due the strings being so long on the bottom.<br /><br />I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,Meets expectations..
4.0,"I couldn't wear them purely because I misjudged how snug they would be, but they're amazing as a product on their own"
4.0,Just wished it had a little more padding on the inside.
4.0,Love this top. It's pretty sheer so expect to wear a camisole under it.
4.0,These glasses are great for the price. As someone who loves the Ray Ban version of these but is too clumsy and cheap to pay the price these are a good option! I've been wearing them for about 7 months now and they're still holding up great!
4.0,It looks good and functions good.
4.0,"This was a gift so I don't have any particular comments.  It was, however, just what I was looking for..."
4.0,"very beautiful dress, cheap material but great price"
4.0,"I had to lose a lot of weight to wear this, but I was already working on that when I ordered this.  This dress is absolutely lovely though. It has two layers and is about knee length, and it flows beautifully.<br /><br />I give it four stars however because it is REALLY thin. You can see EVERYTHING through the top. The bottom is fine, but I had to find a white strapless bra and a slip to be able to wear this out of my bedroom. If you're going to buy this, buy a white slip!"
4.0,"I ordered this necklace for my daughter with her name on it and was a bit surprised to get a totally different name, but I have read that this is because my order was through Vine and it should not happen with other orders.  The necklace chain is of decent quality.  It is of medium thickness and has a lobster clasp that is adjustable.  The name itself is thick and does not bend.  It is written in a nice script.  The necklace seems to be of decent quality overall, especially for the low price.  I think it would make a nice gift for someone."
4.0,Golf shoes are much more comfortable with these insoles.
4.0,Love the design and fit.  I just wish the type of cloth was soft.
4.0,The sizing on this product was perfect!
4.0,Nice once you figure out how to wear iy
4.0,"Looks exactly as advertised. It runs a bit small, but it is very cute. All around a good purchase"
4.0,"VERY nice bags - especially for the price!!! Roomy, soft and beautiful. I ordered two. As for the smell, really only noticeable if you plant your face down into the bag. Just throw a dryer sheet in there for a day or two."
4.0,"Cut of shirt around the shoulders/collar area is a little restrictive, compared to other shirts. Collar really stands up, maybe a little too much."
4.0,Bought this for my Dad and he loves it.
4.0,Good cheap watch! It actually exceeded my expectations for the price.
4.0,i love the style but I can't wear it because even an XL is too small!
4.0,"Nice set of tights for girls, not really women. Unless you’re a short woman. The “convertible” nature is also a little unclear, as there’s just a hole near the foot that you can push your foot through, but then you have a bunched up part around your ankle? If you’re planning to wear them with shoes that are open on the top, this hole might be hard to hide. The tights are thick, and seem like they’ll hold up fairy well. I’m just not sure the convertible aspect is worth it. Either buy tights with feet, or ones that end at the ankle."
4.0,The fit was large but he will grow into it. I love it otherwise.
4.0,A little big But it still good I will keep it
4.0,"Item is exactly as described, fits as it should. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because when I washed it didn’t wash that “great”. It’s still nice and worth the money though."
4.0,"Design color, material all very nice.  Got an XLarge and fits snug, I normally wear a med to large. The biggest thing that bothers me on this is the main zipper is on backwards. America the zipper - zips on the right this jacket zips on the left. Hard to get used to and sometimes when you forget is frustrating when trying to get out of it. Over all a nice jacket, some of my employees want to buy one."
4.0,Good design. Would be nice to get a backside graphic for something like this
4.0,"Wonderful quality for price, very soft,warm and a good fit. I guess they tend to run a bit large, at least in my case, but very happy overall. WAY better than many other brands."
4.0,Not too bad.  It could have used a little more material so that it was longer but I wore it and it was fine.
4.0,This would make a good gift. It came beautifully boxed in elegant black. The earring tree itself is a bronze/brass color. I would have given this 5 stars if it had any holes for pierced earrings. It's good for hoop and ear wire earrings and they look very pretty on this &#34;tree&#34;. I think that for the price it's a great value.
4.0,"Babygirl loved everything about this little dress! I bought the T120 it was a bit loose on her but she didn't care, I should have bought the T110, she is a tall 4yr old but slim. Nevertheless, babygirl loved it! The quality is okay, not too thin or thick leans more on the polyester spandex side and it comes with everything listed."
4.0,"While this case fits well, and may end up being OK,  I'm not very impressed. I don't think this will be good protection for the phone in the long run.<br /><br />I just can not find a case that is heavy duty to protect this phone."
4.0,Performs well
4.0,"Beautiful, good material, it looks classy, I'm giving 4 stars because of the size, it is too small! :("
4.0,This is a beautiful bathing suit. I ordered an XL. It fits perfectly. I usually wear size 4-6.  I'm 5'5 and 156 lbs. My only complain is that the bra pad. It's small and it shows through.  I changed the pad from another bathing suit.
4.0,I read the reviews and I got exactly what I ordered. The skirt is shiny and I like it
4.0,I love silver jewelry & I have several starfish. I love the whimsical look. The only reason why I didn't give 5 starts is bc on the back side of the star fish the metal is a bit sharp. I've never had that on any silver jewelry. Just not polished very well on the back side.
4.0,"It’s light and flowy . I’m 5’4” and 230#. Ordered 3X and it fits loosely. So light and comfortable, casual to go out with flip flops to do errands or with tan wedges for a bit more ! If ordered down a size, my normal,  it probably would have fit, just not as flowy!  So the downfall, after ONE wash, gentle cycle, cold water, a small area of ruffled hem came apart. I’m afraid the more it gets washed the more it’ll come apart. Very disappointing."
4.0,If your looking for a simple everyday bag then this bag meets it. It's nice and soft has adequate compartments snd looks strong enough . I have only used it once but it sees strong enough . The hardware is good quality and doesn't look cheap
4.0,Great but there is no medal/Virgin Mary!
4.0,Love the dress just wish it would've been a little bigger. Recommend sizing up.
4.0,The dress fit well however the slit was oddly made.
4.0,"Ordered a medium for a 7 year old, who is on the slim side. Very good quality, although we haven't washed it yet."
4.0,"We bought 0-3m for our petite 5m boy after reading reviews. My husband asked if it was 0-3 years once we tried it on. We used it for a Baymax Halloween costume. It was big, but we made it work by tucking the excess legs under in the stroller which looked more authentic to the character. We can probably use it again next year as a snowsuit due to the size."
4.0,Not the material I thought it was but my mom liked it. On the shiny side but pattern is pretty
4.0,Got it as gift for a friend and he still wears it and loves it! I would definitely purchase again!
4.0,The material wasn't what I expected. However the &#34;slinky-ness&#34; of it was very flattering on me! I will definitely order more. Might want to order down a size since it runs a little large.
4.0,"They are super cute, unfortunately once you put them on, they don't stay up well."
4.0,Nice for the ball I went to.
4.0,Very nicely fitting dress. Ordered the blue with pink flowers and the color was not quite as pictured so that is why only 4 stars. I am 5 '5 150lb and a medium fits well. I am heavy in lower body so the pockets are a little bulky but having pockets wins every time. Fabric is soft.
4.0,"compared to other vinyl gloves we've bought, these were the thinnest...not sure how durable they are...we'll see as we use them more...otherwise they work like vinyl gloves do....."
4.0,I bought this as a present for my 18 year old grandson bur have not given it to him yet.  I can't comment on hos reaction.  As for mine - it is a beautiful piece of jewelry and definitely masculine (although wouldn't mind wearing it myself).  I was thrilled when I opened the box it came in - much better looking than shown in the picture.  I don't think a picture could capture accurately the color and shine.
4.0,"They work very well, really comfortable . I can't say how they'll hold up over time since I just got them but they seem to be well made"
4.0,"I'm a big guy and have had to adjust regular belts depending on whether I am standing, sitting, etc.  Not necessary with this one. It has enough stretch to accommodate changes in position (and I guess circumference)"
4.0,"Like the jacket, wish the pocket stitching was better."
4.0,Love the dress but the sizes run big.
4.0,"All belts should be made like this. The only problem was the extra loop since its not permanently sewed or glued onto the belt, it can and will fall off and good luck if your cat or dog doesn't find it before you do."
4.0,"It is soft and warm.  My only draw back is that I wear a 34"" inseam/tall so it falls a bit tea length in me."
4.0,A bit big but super cute
4.0,I love this hat. It looks so cute on my son's head.  It's very comfortable and kept the cold out.
4.0,"It was okay for the price! Though, i thought it’d have more rhinestones but once i began wearing it more, I’ve come fond of the simplicity. Pretty Necklace and I’ve showered with it a few times and it has not turn."
4.0,as a costume hat it works. the hat very fern and it holds its shape . I had to hot glue a small piece of plastic foam inside the hat to keep it from sitting on my ears.
4.0,Good looking mask.  My intention was to glue this to the clips taken from clip on sunglasses so I could wear this over my eyeglasses.  However the mask's curved structure makes this approach not work for me which is why I give it 4 stars.  Certainly 5 stars in looks.
4.0,"Loved it and got it earlier than expected! I would have given it 5 stars if the glass cover for the clock hadn't popped off, but nothing a little crazy glue couldn't fix!"
4.0,stylish sunglasses. looks good.
4.0,I’m 5.38 and these stockings are too long for me. Not like I can’t wear them but I’d wish they were a bit shorter. Also a bit too thin for my thighs.<br />But besides that they are awesome! Looks really nice. Good quality.
4.0,They fit perfectly one of them was a little chipt but over there nice
4.0,"These shoes are exceptionally made, my grand-daughter loves them but keep in mind that they tend to run large as we have found with most Disney footwear.  A little cotton in the toes and she'll grow into them before these shoes wear out."
4.0,This is a really nice top and what I absolutely loved about is is the way it feels.  It has a soft silky cotton-like feel to it and feels very nice against my skin when I put it on.  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because it didn't quite fit me according to the size.  The arms were tight while the rest of the top fit very comfortably.  I purchased this at a very discounted price in exchange for giving my opinion of this product.
4.0,I bought these to help block the sun out on my long bike rides. It does a good job but I feel some sun still gets through so I apply 15 SPF on my neck before I put it on. They are lightweight and breathable and feel silky.
4.0,"Arrived on time and just as pictured. This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loved it.  The only reason for a 4 instead of 5, I wish it came in a box."
4.0,Back of slipper somewhat uncomfortable but otherwise a goid fit for a size 13
4.0,My son is 3 1/2 and loves them. But one light went out on th second day. That was disappointing for the price of the shoe.
4.0,I like this brush. It's smaller by half than a shoe shine brush. Easy to keep them separate.
4.0,Purse was a little  heavy before I put my stuff in. Also the zipper should have gone from one edge to the other  to much gap a both  ends of purse<br /> But good thing I was able to get my bible and small note  pad inside.
4.0,"I've been taking it out for a few snowboarding sessions and I must say that it works pretty well.  I'm trying to do grinds and box slides, and those are very unforgiving so it gives me some peace of mind to know that it won't hurt too bad if I slip out and fall.  It'll still hurt for sure, this isn't a miracle impact absorber but it does dampens the damages quite a bit.  It's also very form fitting.  I was able to fit it on top of my long johns, wear my one piece thermal over it, and slip on my snowboarding pants without too much problem.  And it doesn't look bulky at all with all those layers.  My only criticism is that I hate the velcro where the flyhole is.  I don't understand why it's needed.  It just makes everything much more difficult to access especially when you have as many layers as I do.  The velcro will stick to other articles of clothing.  Why couldn't they just have the flyhole where it is w/o velcro and just have the velcro contained to the waistband?  Other than that, I'd recommend for use of every activity where your bum is at risk.<br /><br />I should add that I am a 30 size waist and bought M (Middle) and it fits pretty great."
4.0,"This swim top is cute, but the layers don’t really flutter as much as I was hoping they would. They are too short to really overlap much. It is a nice top, just not really what I was expecting"
4.0,A liiiiittle small. It is def a snug fit.
4.0,Just as described. I ordered m/l and it fits fine.
4.0,"I really like this dress, it was delivered earlier than expected. The only thing I'm disappointed about is that the black was not as dark as I thought it would be, it was more like a really dark grey and the texture is different from the pic. Overall, I love this dress, would recommend."
4.0,Smaller than i thought but nicely packaged
4.0,Came w/ hard shell case & cleaning clothe.
4.0,"This slippers are really nice, good quality and bright colors. The only negative side is that they are very small. My daughter wears size 9 and I purchased this in a size 10 for them to last for the rest of the year and maybe beginning of next year, well the size 10 were exactly the size of her foot no extra room, her toes were tight in them. So if you are purchasing you'll need to go 1 or two sizes up. I had to return them and couldn't reorder because 10 is the biggest size."
4.0,NOT CRAZY WITH MAZE OF SETTINGS.
4.0,Received these as a gift. They are nice and soft. Very comfy! The tank is a little snug but I don’t mind since they are pajamas.
4.0,"Nice glasses! I like the glass lenses, I like the tint (gradient) and I like the light titanium frames. These are very nice glasses. Of course, glasses are a personal thing and my wife hates some glasses on me and loves others, it really is a matter of whether they fit your face shape or not. My face is long oval, so these work well. They're also very comfortable to wear for hours.<br /><br />I decided to get these because my new car has a heads-up display (HUD) and my normal driving glasses, Maui Jims (great glasses!!) have polarized lenses. Polarized lenses are super for reducing glare and reflections but they also block the HUD (like all polarized glasses will do) - apparently Jaguar's HUD uses a LASER to create the image so polarized glasses are find, but Mercedes uses a regular display so there's that.<br /><br />I needed to find a new pair of glasses for this car to takeadvantage of the HUD and still make driving comfortable. The options for high quality (not designer) non-polarized glass lenses is not very wide and Serengeti Velocity was right near the top of my list. I decided to try them since buying from Amazon allowed free returns if they didn't fit well (or didn't pass the wife review). I got lucky and they are everything I hoped for. On top of that, they were offered with same day delivery in my area, so I ordered in the morning and got wife approval of the purchase around 6pm. I didn't even have to fight for parking at the mall to satisfy my impulse buying :)<br /><br />Now here's the reason for 4 stars, instead of 5. The lenses create an odd reflection from headlights. I noticed this when looking in the rear view mirror just before dusk and saw a red pair of dots in my rear window, seeming to float there in front of the car behind me (with the headlights on). It took me a few minutes to realize it was a reflection from the headlights in the lenses of the glasses (they went with the car behind when it turned left). Slightly distracting at dusk, but not too bad, especially now I know what it is."
4.0,"The design is only on one side.  However, you have two designs instead of one for scarves.  There is no worries about whether it is longer enough to tie the two ends. I received it in 10 days."
4.0,Posts were to short
4.0,"If you are a woman with a chest, this isn't for you. Beautiful dress!"
4.0,Wish they were woven tighter....the knit is on the loose side and I wonder if they will last long....
4.0,"Dress was delivered in a timely manner and was just as expected other than a bit too small to be a medium...or possibly, I'm a bit too large to be a medium!!<br />Color was true, and it is comfortable (now that I exchanged it for a large!)"
4.0,"First off, it's a shockingly nice presentation, when received.  It comes in a white gift box, with a ribbon around it.  Then you've got the cushioning tissue surrounding the shawl, once you lift the box lid.  I do think the construction of the shawl is much nicer, utilizing 60% wool, as opposed to the wispy stuff made totally out of acrylic (that you can find for about $10 less on sale).  The tradeoff of better construction, is that it is a little rougher on the skin.  It has a nice weight to it.  The color is a softer light beige on the outside, not the pinkish beige in the picture.  Sort of wish the tag was attached a little differently, so it could be removed for reversibility of the color, in wearing.  This should come in handy to keep me warm, after some upcoming torso surgery."
4.0,Bag is very nice.  It's the perfect size for carry on luggage .  I would would give it 5 stars but I've only had it a few days.  I'll do another rewiew later.
4.0,I love this dress...it's very comfortable and it does not cling.  I like a bit longer of a sleeve so this was perfect for me...fits true to size
4.0,I put a gel insert in the shoes and they fit perfect
4.0,Great looking coat in all the details. Especially the little things makes this jacket exceptional.
4.0,These looked red they are neon dark orange. My picky kid still loves them so we will keep them. The color thing could just be my iPad.
4.0,"This only didn't get 5 stars because its A TWO PIECE and not a single dress. Thankfully, now I have a cute top and a form fitting skirt. Although I don't like them together, the set works as separates. This qualityis good and is a very comfortable, thicker material to wear. I am 5'8, 160 with DD top and purchased a large."
4.0,My mom liked it<br />I didn’t .
4.0,"This is definitely teal, not green so if you were hoping for a more ""true"" green, this ain't it! However, the color is still very pretty and the shirt is super soft!!"
4.0,Good value for the price.  Fit is slightly snug.  I did not give 4 stars. only because the liner and drawstring are more like a bathing suit than athletic shorts. Perhaps that is why they are less expensive?
4.0,Spacious bag
4.0,Perfect fit and such a beautiful dress!
4.0,fits well now but has not been washed yet
4.0,Very happy with my order.
4.0,"Just as described. As others have said, however, it does have a weird smell at first and does end up curling up. The smell goes away after a few days though. The other thing I don't like about this is the fact that there is no cover to protect my items. I didn't think it would be a problem at first, but after using this for several months, many of the earbuds and chords have been destroyed. Also, the straps cannot keep down even slightly heavy items, such as an external battery. The device is convenient for organization though and holds everything I need it to hold. The back pocket is almost completely useless in that it is way to thin for it too hold anything aside from small paper."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at the apparent quality of this swim suit. All the seams appear to be well sewn. The fit is exactly what I expected after reading other reviews. It's slightly on the small side, but I expected it and planned ahead. The bottoms have a little less coverage than I was hoping for. I ordered the L. I usually wear a size 8 dress and a 34B. The top fits just as I hoped and the elastic in the bra is comfortable. There is room for someone with a bigger bust without making mine look empty. It might be a stretch to say the L fits up to a size 10."
4.0,Fast shipping. Ok quality. Ordered a small. Arms are a bit tight but fits correctly elsewhere.
4.0,They were cool. Too big for my face. I had to return them.
4.0,"Just as some other reviewers have mentioned, the sleeves are a little too big/wide. Other then that, I love the fit and feel of sweatshirt."
4.0,I followed the sizing chart and it was too big for me around the waist area. It’s stretchy material. I love The skirt material and details. Will be ordering in a smaller size!
4.0,I was a little worried it would suck due to lack of actual photographs of the item rather than a photo shopped image but all in all it arrived and looked as expected.
4.0,Love it. I just wish one side was satin lined. Definitely dries the hair out.
4.0,Nice color to the dress and a good fit. Order a few sizes larger that your normal dress size.
4.0,On the low end of what they show in the picture!
4.0,Good for workout and walk nice quality
4.0,Really cute dress! I'm a curvy girl and normally buy XL (14-16). I purchased size XL and had to return because dress was to snug in arms and chest. Returned and order 1X fits me perfectly! I love the style so I'm happy I sized up!
4.0,a bit tight but overall a good product for the price
4.0,"I love this mask BUT , that rhinestone in the middle has got to go!  Gave me an instant headache because it kept digging in my forehead the entire time. I gave up and popped it out!! I would of given 5 stars. It’s  that rhinestone that  killed my vibe."
4.0,This replacement band is defintely more stylist the ln the band that comes with your original alta purchase.  I love that you can remove or add links to fit perfectly.  It came in a small tin box which is perfect to house the links and pins I removed.  Since it's a clasp closure it is more secure.  I would recommend this product.
4.0,Only giving it 4 stars because I had to get a small but luckily they fit my daughter. They came really fast. The pants fit great. They are really soft. Love it.
4.0,Came quick happy it came
4.0,"I can't wear these with thick socks, but the fit is fine.  I wouldn't wear them all day, but they are not uncomfortable."
4.0,Not a fan of the shorts they’re okay but great for the price and the shirt is perfect!
4.0,"Came in a great time frame, almost 3 days early! Super easy to put on and still hugged my frame and slimmed me down. I'll be needing to get a smaller one soon because I've been losing weight but this is amazing. Super easy even to use the restroom without all the hassle! I feel put together and its comfy while giving you some great results. Husband couldn't keep his hands off:) My only thing is stomach area could use something extra to pull it in."
4.0,"Skirt was absolutely beautiful and material was thin and seemed to be light and cool at the beach. The only issue I had was it was to long and wasn't able to roll up in orders to shorten. I am 5.8"" so it is very uncommon for anything to be long enough to drag the ground!"
4.0,"Beautiful bag, just a little small for me. If you prefer a smaller bag, I highly recommend it."
4.0,"I like that they really are water resistant & liquids can't soak through the apron (the inside of the fabric is plastic-y). Mostly true to picture. The fabric used for the strings & neck loop looked like it was canvas in the pictures, but it's just really cheap & scratchy. Not the end of the world. I just wish the strings were a tiny bit longer. I like to wrap them around & tie in the front so I can drape a dish towel through the string around my waist, and I just barely have enough string to do that--but my bf can't. All in all, pretty decent, cute-looking apron."
4.0,"I get alot of compliments when I wear this top. My only issue would be the odd way the line goes from the back around the bust. It tens to crawl up and I am tugging on it to keep the girls where they belong. I plan to add some elastic to the front to fix it. I wonder if I bought the wrong size...my mistake, not theirs. I would buy another...I like it."
4.0,It was bigger than what I expected.
4.0,Fit perfect and very nice fabric.
4.0,Great! Comfy.  A little big since it is a one size fits all. Wish it came in different sizes. But makes for a great swim suit cover up.
4.0,I ordered a size larger and I am glad I did
4.0,"I like the bands, very comfortable, looks nice"
4.0,"I love this too. Vibrant colors fits true to size. It’s more of a tshirt material than sweater, which is fine by me because I’m so hot natured. I love it I bought size Xl"
4.0,"It does not look vey strong, but seems OK.<br />Also swam with the strap and all looks good, so I gave it a 4"
4.0,"The only thing I’m not crazy about is the white edging at the collar where it buttons. Otherwise it’s lovely, fits as expected and is made with quality."
4.0,Beautiful dress; however it fits very tight.  I will pass this on to my daughter.
4.0,Good quality will buy more
4.0,"Just don’t like how easy the steel can be separated, have to squeeze it back for tension every so often."
4.0,"I absolutely love the cozy, lightweight feel of this top. It is not quite bodycon but does fit well enough to emphasize curves. The semi cropped cut also is very flattering and the cut outs are great to show peeks of a nice skirt or bottom beneath. The hood is lightweight, too, and doesn’t drag the shirt down. It does have a tendency to turn itself inside out, but that’s a minor detail. I’d give this too 5 stars if it weren’t for those ribbons! What I originally thought was a cute detail became really aggravating as I had to continually retire them throughout the night."
4.0,"I did not realize there was elastic at the empire waist.  It is uncomfortable, unfortunately.  Nice quality, however."
4.0,Great buy. Very nice rosaries.
4.0,"We love this hat, but the mittens are a bit too small."
4.0,Pretty cute swimsuit. Flattering on all types of bodies. The only downfall is the padding in the top is very small. I had to remove it in order for the suit to look right.
4.0,The stone could have been of better quality and would have been even better with matching earrings.
4.0,It is a nice fit
4.0,"Hey all,<br />I recently purchased these for myself as my husband has some also and swears by them. I do love that the package comes with several different colors so I can change it up according to outfit, but I do wish they were a little dainty(I feel it's pretty thick) otherwise fit as expected and comfortable. Super convenient for the gym, house cleaning, swimming, etc."
4.0,Quality materials in a well thought out design. The shape hugs my feet perfectly. Material is super duper soft. All in all a very comfortable sock for lounging or daily use.
4.0,"came on time,very cute,only thing is i thought it would glow in the dark more its like a light glow you cant really see but still like it."
4.0,"The finish is nice, the detail is crisp. Unfortunately, the chain is a bit too short for them to hang nicely from my mirror. I managed to open up one link in the chain and used black cord salvaged from the drawstring bag they came with to add a &#34;cheater&#34; length of a couple inches so they will hang better in my car."
4.0,"Came exactly as pictures and everything I wanted! I did order a size up and it ended up being a tad big, but I have plenty of time for alterations before the wedding!"
4.0,"four stars because I have little fingers and they fit me for the most part, only two were a little big, the crossed arrows one I have to wear on my thumb. and the double triangle was the other one that was just a little big but not as big as the crossed arrow one so I could get away with wearing that one on my pointer finger. The reason I gave it four stars is they will turn colors if you wear them a lot so I had to paint mine with clear nail polish."
4.0,"I just use these underneath other tanks and shirts, it gets the job done.  I like the colors, but the material isn't really comfortable and they are pretty snug.  I love that they are long though.  I'd recommend them for layering."
4.0,Such a fun costume. The kids loved it!
4.0,I am 5'10 and it runs short.
4.0,Great fit. withstands frequent washing.
4.0,"This is a nice dress or cover up for the beach. The spaghetti straps are very long, so the neckline is low on the chest. The fabric is heavier than I thought it would be, but is very soft. It washed well."
4.0,"I just received this and tried it on.  The material seems substantial enough and the fit is just right... not much room for error here.  The LARGE is for a 12/14.  I am between a 12 and 14 and it fit me like a swimsuit might, except in the torso.  I'm 5'9"" so the jumpsuit fit snugly in my crack and landed 1"" higher on my leg.  So I'm returning this for the XL in hopes the torso will fit better and the pants leg will be a bit longer."
4.0,"This dress is a comfortable and cute but order up a size from your normal size. I am 5'2&#34; 138 lbs and normally wear S or M but after reading previous reviews, I ordered a L and so glad I did."
4.0,Great watch. I get compliments all the time. It would of got 5 stars if it was a little easier to read. If it would of had light gray minute hand and slashes it would of got a 5. Can’t wait to buy another original grain!!!
4.0,The spring clip should be  in the back of the knee as will leave an impression on the crease.
4.0,"The shoes were exactly what my daugher wanted and expected, she was super happy.  My only issue is that on the 3rd day one of the shoe stopped working which cause mad momments for my daughter. I started the refund processed but after watching yotube videos on how to fix it, we might just keep them.  To bad I was not given a customer service phone number for any technical support.  For the price I paid it provided some pleasure."
4.0,"Looks beautiful on, careful not to snag the fabric as it is thin and will put a whole in this sweater"
4.0,Loved the outfit and all the accessories. I docked it a star because when I tried on the pearl necklace it broke. I had to get string and put back every little pearl to create the necklace again.
4.0,it was a bit smaller for my dd breasts.
4.0,Love this brand always fits just right
4.0,"The product is just as described. I usually wear a 14 so I ordered an XL, I could have gotten in a large. Because it's too big the material buckles."
4.0,"Nice shirt, order a size up though."
4.0,"This was the perfect choice for a Birthday dress. I was quite nervous about it based on the reviews, but the chance was well worth it. The dress is not as thin and see thru as depicted. The stretch in the back was great as without it I probably would not have been able to fit it. My sleeves seemed a bit short, but I was ok with that as my arms are short. This may not have worked on someone with long arms. The color is also as pictured. I love that the dress looks costly, but really is inexpensive. All in all I think it’s a great dress for a birthday or holiday, wedding, or anytime you just want to feel sexy!"
4.0,love this dress.  a bit large.  very cute with leggings!
4.0,"I bought this dress to use as a Halloween costume with the hope that I would like it wear as a dress outside of Halloween.  It did not disappoint.  I did a lot of research reading through the reviews before i purchased it and I was very happy with my choice.  I received so many compliments on the dress and how it looked and fit.  I used it twice, as 50's Rockabilly and also a sugar skull.  I am 5'7'' 245 pounds and a 38 DDD bust.  I ordered the XL and it fit great.  I generally where a XL in normal everyday clothes or a size 16. I was not able to wear a bra with it mainly for the cut.  It came just below the knee without the petticoat, right at the knee with the petticoat.  The material was a good thick cotton as described in the prior reviews.  The only reason that I could not give this dress 5 stars is because of the zipper.  It is one of the zippers that is small and hidden so they are kinda hard to zip especially if you are doing it by yourself and the stretch panel in the back does not aid in the zipping process.  I feel this would not be an issue if you have some one to zip it for you however I did not.  I ended up putting on the dress over my head fully zipped and just pulled it down.  I did not like the ribbon belt that came with it, I would have liked something a little thicker.  Over all I loved the dress and so did everyone else.  I will be buying another in a different color."
4.0,Gift - Very well made and looks nice
4.0,A FAIR PRICE<br /><br />I FEEL IT NEEDS A STRAP OVER THE CENTRE TO GIVE IT MORE SUPPORT AS WHEN YOU RUN THE CAMERA BOUNCES AROUND<br /><br />I MAY ADD A CENTRE STRAP
4.0,"Lets start with the good. This is a very good looking, supple, leather strap that has become soft and compliant with very little wrist time. It compliments lots of divers well.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish the darkened edges had more variability, creating more of a weathered appearance, but I guess that may happen over time.<br /><br />i have a large wrist and the strap fits me great."
4.0,"I got this to put my keys in since I never use a purse and it's been getting annoying to put my keys on my wallet. I have to say, it is a little different than I expected because I thought I could hook all my keys on without taking them off the joined link that they are on. I did put my home key and Mail key inside and used the &#34;wallet&#34; looking pocket to hold my car keys which I hooked onto the one link. It will still close even with my keyfob but I doubt it would with even one more key in it. The nice thing, my keys don't jingle all the time when I walk nor do I have to try to wrap it around my wallet. Good enough!<br />I was fortunate to receive this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased testing and review. My opinion is based solely on my personal experience with the keychain holder and not influenced by any outside sources."
4.0,"I probably should have read the description more carefully since I expected a sweatshirt which this is not.  It is a thin, very silky material which is &#34;cold&#34; when you put it on.  When you live in Ohio in winter, this is not what you want for warmth.  The print is very vibrant and goes all the way around, which I liked.  It does run small based on the size chart so order at lease one size larger, particularly since this is supposed to be a men's shirt.  I bought this for my daughter, who wears a size 10, and the medium just fit her. The seller was very prompt about addressing my issue, however, so no problem there."
4.0,"Beautiful designs. Very boho. Very very thin material, and very long. I'm 5'7. True to size."
4.0,"The watch arrived on the promised date, it looked very nice when I sized the bracelet and had it on. The problem was that in the first day of weather it was running about 3.5 hours fast. I couldn't imagine even the worst watch being that far out of adjustment.<br />I played around with it for about three days setting it in different positions to see if it would settle down.  When I wound it on the fourth day I could feel a pop and since then and after a week it has lost five seconds compared to the time on my phone. I am very happy with this watch and happy to wear it daily now. It's a nice fitting watch and looks like it should cost more. The lume on the hands and markers isn't very bright but if I charge it up before going to bed I am able to see it in the morning still before the sun rises. All in all it's a good buy for the money."
4.0,"It looks just like the picture, very pretty"
4.0,Got lots of compliments but the material is a little thin
4.0,Buy this for summer fun.
4.0,"a little snug for this size, but ok..."
4.0,Nice color. Nice soft material.
4.0,"I ordered the white. This is somewhat see through. Not quite sheer but close to it. Ribbed material, lightweight. Good buy for the price. Nice summer sweater."
4.0,"I am 170 lbs and 5'3&#34;. I got the size Large and it fit me perfectly. It was loose just like in the picture. It is a spandex kind of material. I used it for a cover up at the beach and it was perfect for that. After washing it, I did notice some strings unraveling but you can't beat it for the price."
4.0,"The first one I received wouldn't run in a vertical position.  It was quickly replaced.<br /><br />The watch is beautiful.  It is fascinating to watch the inner workings of the watch.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars if the hour and minute hand were black with a white interior.  Gold with white is a little difficult to see.  Also the second hand doesn't stop, as described in the instructions, when the winder is pulled out.  You have to be quick to set the time accurately."
4.0,"I like that it fits well , but I don't like the material at bottom not what I wanted , but it ok like it ."
4.0,"Fit as expected, great price"
4.0,"I work part-time to deliver food. It is very warm, and you can use a raincoat when it rains. Very suitable for my working environment. I like."
4.0,"This is a cute, comfy jacket but it runs small."
4.0,Just like I needed it to do.  Simple to use once I got it unlatched. I washed my golf and sport hats.
4.0,"I originally ordered this for my Garmin Venu. It was advertised to fit, however, it did not. I threw it into my jewelry box, dissapointed as I was excited to have something other than the original silicone band, which was causing an awful skin infection. I was about to hope on and give it a one Star review as it did not work for the Garmin it was advertised to work for.<br /><br />Fast forward several months; I upgraded to the Garmin Venu 2 Plus watch, and decided to dig out this band to see if it would fit. Low and behold, it does! Not sure what the heck the difference is, as they are supposedly the same size, but whatever. I'm happy to say it fits, it looks great, and I haven't had a skin infection with this one. I have not yet tested it out on my run, as it is currently winter and I don't do much running this time of the year, so I can't speak of it's durability through a sweaty run."
4.0,The sleeves are too long- otherwise it's my fit.
4.0,"The fabric is very well done. The style and the dress overall is really great and fits nicely showing off my curves perfectly. The only negatives for this dress are: 1) the underarms area is very very loose and I have huge breasts. 2) too much cleavage as the front is low. 3) the bottom liner and sequin fabric don’t match up and aren’t sewn together so the dress sits strangely at the bottom. Since it is a very inexpensive dress, I’m thinking of altering it. Not sure yet Az I have another dress I bought that fits me like a (too) tight glove (so sitting may be impossible if I can’t trim some weight by the weekend). Will try to add photo(s) another day. I knocked down 1 star for the underarm area being so strangely baggy. Other then that, this dress would look spectacular on any woman and my boyfriend’s eyes popped out of his head so that’s worth 4 stars lol"
4.0,I bought this in extra large knowing the sizing runs small.  It barely fits.  It is a little snug at the bottom.  I still think it's pretty.
4.0,"The purse is a nice size if you like bigger bags, the handles fit over the shoulder without the additional strap if you like to wear it that way (which I do) but the strap is nice. The material is nice too. My only wish would be for an outside pocket"
4.0,"good quality material, but there was no #001 and 2 #002s...  not a deal breaker, just annoying."
4.0,I like the fit of the vest but it is alot thinner then it looks in the picture.
4.0,My son loved it he  look Really handsome:)
4.0,"I just can’t hold in the boobs and feel like I’m family party appropriate  in a wrap type dress! - but comfortable, pretty, love the pockets"
4.0,I love these laces but there is no red I them please make some with all of these colors but put some red in them!
4.0,"Loved the comfort and stylishness of this dress. Material is pretty clingy, so I'd recommend a body shaper underneath if you're a bit bulgy like me. Runs a bit small, order a size up if you're uncertain. Tons of compliments while wearing the blue!"
4.0,Pretty big frames and really pretty. Just gotta handle with care. Keeps the sun outta my eyes decently
4.0,Does the job and is very warm.
4.0,Esperaba tres colores diferentes y me llegaron 3 iguales
4.0,Wish they had xsmall. Using it for an outing.
4.0,I liked everything but I wished that it came in other colors besides black
4.0,Yea I guess she likes it lol
4.0,Doesn’t come with the saying card like shown in photo.
4.0,"I'm 5'7, it's not as long as the picture shows, but it's pretty and fits great.. thus was for a 2016 cruise.  I still have it in my collection"
4.0,"This Bow tie was great. Nicely packaged in a box, Smooth and shiny. A little big for my Son's 7.5&#34; neck but otherwise a real conversation piece."
4.0,"Beautiful and not overly heavy, but pricey for costume jewelry. Still, I am a photographer, and they photographed very well, so I'd say they're worth the investment."
4.0,Comfy to wear!!
4.0,"Several options, quality is decent."
4.0,These are extremely soft and didn't seem to shrink in the wash/dry. I'm not sure how warm they are but they are thicker than the socks my son normally wears and the length would naturally add warmth when layering. The colors have also not seemed to have faded in 1 or 2 washes.
4.0,Un poco pequeño de acuerdo a las medidas. El material es excelente
4.0,Ordered 1 of each. Super light weight and changes color perfectly but... The his crazy ring part of the lettering (z and part of y) are gone. Like the letters just came off inside. Other then that great!
4.0,Pregnant daughter said it was 'fine&#34;.
4.0,Beautiful bag. I bought it to fill and donate to a fundraiser. I was confused about what appeared to be a big pocket on the back but the bottom was actually open. Not sure of the purpose of that and did not like that feature.
4.0,"My son looks great in this shirt but t was a bit small and a bit thin. He always wears a teeshirt or tank top under his dress shirts. With that it was not as think as I would have liked a dress shirt to be, But the two tone and the way the sleeves fit were a bit tight but nice. My son is a football player in high school and always growing and every brand fits different."
4.0,the neck tie is pretty big and a little scratchy on my skin also i dont understand how you are suppposed to attach the tail
4.0,This close fit boxer mens underwear is enjoyable for me to wear.  There is no riding up with this product. You are at ease sitting or standing.
4.0,"Looks just like the model. I think it’s awkward on my butt bc I have a bigger butt, but I’m also newer to dressing modest so irdk. Maybe its normal."
4.0,Very  nice bracelet.  It is a little larger then I expected but it is very nice.  One thing I found is the ability to remove a link to make it a little smaller  (there are two clasps).  Overall I am happy with it.
4.0,"Nothing spectacular, but for costume it was good."
4.0,I bought these for postpartum c-section recovery. They would probably work I just can't get into the material. They are the athletic yoga pants material but lose. I do like the stretch in the drawstring though. Close but will be returning.
4.0,Dank
4.0,Runs small but it was exactly as pictured.
4.0,"Material is very thin but product is good for a breezy, summer dress."
4.0,"I do like this nightgown. Sizing is good and I think the price is right. It's a standard satiny fabric that feels good on your skin. What I like most about it is the length. It isn't something down to your ankles, providing more coverage than you need and trying to trip you. It also isn't so short that it rides up on you when you toss and turn at night. This seems to be just the right length for staying in place throughout the night. I've found it hard to find a nightshirt that finds that perfect balance between too long and too short, but this one is it. With that said, though, I think the style is lacking in some areas. The cut is, frankly, uninteresting. Aside from a rather strangely cut v-neck, it's really just a satin sack that you wear to bed. For this reason, I don't think it's the most attractive nightgown I've owned by far. However, with the perfect length and a soft material so light that you forget you're wearing it, it has quickly become one of my favorite night gowns."
4.0,Colors are beautiful. Looks great on.
4.0,This jacket is super cute! Sadly I ordered the wrong size so I’ll need to return it. 🤦🏼‍♀️
4.0,"Really cute although somewhat small, but a larger size because they have the adjustable waistband."
4.0,I bought this for my sister and she loves the combination of symbols attached together. the style is rustic and simple and looks great.
4.0,"I wear this tie every time, it scrunches up in the middle though."
4.0,Great look on my baby
4.0,Its nice and exactly as pictured. My only problem is lenght. It should be a little longer. For adult woman it will be too tight. other than that its good choice and price.
4.0,"Very nice glasses however my bad; realize I already have a pair like this! Oh well, extra for the great outdoors and good sun blocker of sorts"
4.0,"Kind of hard to push the umbrella closed.  Miss not having a hook handle, but still I would highly recommend it."
4.0,"It was very long, you should expect to get it hemmed. Lots of compliments and very comfortable though. The lace is soft but sturdy."
4.0,I got a lot of compliments on this hat. I'm petite and it's a little big but really cute.
4.0,mediam is almost a large in other hats I have purchased.
4.0,"I was worried about the sizing and/or quality since this appears to be one of those Chinese/Asian designs that are all over Amazon.com. But the sizing is spot-on (at most, it runs only slightly large) and is USA sizes. This model at least ships from the USA so doesn't take long.<br /><br />Only downside is all but the bottom two pockets are fake, and those pockets are flimsy and just dangle from the inside of the jacket rather than being embedded in lining as they should be. Nonetheless, you get this bad boy for the looks."
4.0,"I was expecting it to be longer.  I need it for s wedding Saturday.  I ordered a kimono to go with it and it’s what makes the dress.  It’s extra extra big and long and it sets off this dress,"
4.0,"Very Nice.  IMHO, thin ties, which this is, should be in the description."
4.0,"The dress was cute buy way too big.  My daughter ordered a small, which she normally wears, but it was huge on her.  We had to send the dress back. Otherwise, it was a cute dress."
4.0,Exactly as expected.  They do wear on my index finger knuckle a bit though.
4.0,"It's a OK dress, but the halter part is see through, it came with two nipple covers."
4.0,So comfy soft and lightweight.
4.0,"Beware, sleeve lengths are a bit longer than i expected. I prefer my sleeve length to stop around my wrist but this can goes well beyond that. im sure with a couple washes and drys, it'll shrink enough for it to be a perfect fit."
4.0,Nice Collector's Item that Looks & Fits Great
4.0,Nice weight and fit comfortably
4.0,Good quality for the price. These are smaller more for the nose.  The bigger ones work in the ears.
4.0,"Very baggy, lots of crotch room. Interesting pockets, definitely take some getting used too. All my friends have complimented me on them, and they seem like good jam pants, just haven't tried them out yet."
4.0,Overall he liked the outfit but the pants was a bit tight on him.
4.0,"I have worn these for 6 pool swims in the last 7 days. Before putting them on I was concerned about the quality of the elastic in the legs and that they would “ride up” my legs. While they are not super-snug, they do fit well, stay in place and have an attractive appearance. The waist elastic is over 1.5” wide and very adequate.  If you want a completely snug suit this won’t be for you. But I find it very satisfactory and a good value."
4.0,"the rose fell off, but I re glued it. for the price I didn't care, the rest was secure and nice."
4.0,Is okay it is another option for what I have
4.0,the only one`s that actually glow are the yellow and orange one :/
4.0,"This shirt is so cute. Being white, it is a little thinner than I'd prefer but was super cute with a tank underneath. It is a nice option here because it doesn't get super cold until after Christmas here."
4.0,It is absolutely beautiful. Very good quality. It exactly matches with my dress I bought for.
4.0,"Fit great, but fabric was thinner than I was expecting.  Design looks just like the picture."
4.0,"This gown is beautiful, after reading the reviews  l bought an XL  instead of M. Am going to return it for medium."
4.0,My daughter loves these. Perfect for boating.
4.0,"The wands were lovely, as pictured; however, one of them broke within minutes of use (normal use), but it was perfect for our tinkerbell themed party."
4.0,Good fit and made well.
4.0,This is really lovely on.  The colors are more of a purple/ mauve and light gray.  This isn't very long at all.  I'm 5' 2&#34; and it just hits the ground with flats.  It does run a little large and that I think is mostly the elastic in the waist and bust.  I am currently 150 lbs and meant to order a medium but accidentally ordered the small and it still fit just fine.
4.0,"Cute as can be. Size small. The bust is a little tight (34D), length is an inch too long (5'3&#34;). I'll get a medium when I order again and hope it isn't longer. But super cute and comfy."
4.0,Very nice...didn't realize it was size of half dollar but itl work as gift still
4.0,"Perfect for little girls 10 or younger. So adorable and well made. Just very small. Wont do for an adult or teen, hard for a adult to use ,or out over their arm . But my toddler loves it and it works great for her. Little holes due to how crocheted so nothing small can be put in unless I sew a liner inside the bag."
4.0,"I was kind of having mixed feelings about ordering these Becuase of the low review count and the mixed reviews. But, these are very comfortable, aside from the right side which for some reason is annoying me a lot, but I’ll get used to it. These are very comfy! They are true to size!! They are great!!!"
4.0,"Great necklace. Does get a little tangled when it's loop like in the picture, light weight, I do question its durability."
4.0,"The polka dots left indentations on my legs and were itchy. I'm 5'1&#34; and they fit well. I'm a pregnant nurse working 12 hour shifts on my feet. They worked ok to reduce pain and swelling, but the ones I got from Walgreens were better."
4.0,Daughter loved. It is perfect for small wrists.
4.0,"Like the color, and the texture. So far it has held up well when I play volleyball and when I wash it. The only thing that I dislike is that there is a tiny gap when it is fully zipped and sand can easily get in. But other than that it's great!"
4.0,I really like the bright colors and design.  I was going to wear to wait tables but runs large and to hot
4.0,Needed straps to hold my wheeled luggage pieces together for long walks through airports and cruise terminals. These very sturdy straps worked great. Easily clip together if I need longer lengths.
4.0,"This scarf is very appealing to the eye. For the price its good. Not the best material, but still looks pretty."
4.0,"Love these glasses, I got so many complements, there was only one issue they were bent when I receive them other than that love them."
4.0,A good buy.
4.0,I bought it for my gf and she loved everything except the sizes of the strap. The shoulder strap wouldn't adjust small enough and the fixed strap wasnt quite big enough
4.0,"I like the looks of these earrings.  I found the ear wire part a little thick for my ear holes.  I am older and have had pierced ears for a long time.  As everyone knows the holes tend to enlarge when you wear dangles for years and mine are no exception but the ear wire on these earrings are too thick for even my stretched ears.  I still wear them because they are pretty, but they become uncomfortable by the end of the day and I'm glad to remove them."
4.0,I returned for replacement in a larger size. Look forward to a quick return as this aisle a gift.
4.0,"This backpack was exactly something I was looking for in terms of size. I was tired of those &#34;small&#34; backpacks that were impossible to hold more than a wallet and a phone. When it arrived I thought it was too big to be considered a mini back bag but after a while its the perfect size for me. In the pictures you can see everything I have inside on a daily basis and how much space it takes up. Of course since I have bulky things like a Nintendo ds case, my glasses, and my wallet, it makes it look like its halfway full. But I removed those things in the third picture to show the difference between bulky and non bulky items. This backpack is good for those who carry some bulky things like me or going to class with a mini laptop and regular books. It's also nice that not only I can carry it on my shoulders but also in my hand with the handle for when I'm in the car or in the bus and need it on my lap. I gave it 4 stars because it came with two strings that I pulled on instinct and made part of the handle all fuzzy. But it's ok to me because it was my fault for not snipping it off."
4.0,Love this dress on a hot day for around the house. It is like a polyester material so it does get heavy at the bottom when you wear it. Which in turn pulls T the top a bit because of the weight of the material. I would of purchase a size medium not s large. I wear a size 10 in woman's pants and I am a size 38 DD up top.  I purchased a size large. But I love the room when I lounge around the house. Love it!
4.0,They are pretty good. They are a good size on the top just tight at the bottom. I will still be using them though.
4.0,"I'm very happy with these. There are a few that the ball doesn't stay screwed in, but just toss them and you have extra posts. lol They're a great size, easy to put in and stay in well. Definitely worth getting to add to your collection, or have on backup. I carry a few in my purse just in case one falls out."
4.0,Ball gown
4.0,The fit was perfect I normally wear a lg and bought a lg. I took a star for the material. Other then that the design and colors are unmatched I totally love it
4.0,This ball cap is very well made. An outstanding product. It is every thing I could ask for. It is as described. I will not hesitate ordering from this company again.
4.0,Just ok product. Doesn’t always fit in container
4.0,"The iolite is nice and has a lot of sparkle, however, it's very small and it look great for a pair of earrings, not for a pendant. The delivery was great. It would give four stars for the size of the gem, not for the color."
4.0,Bought this for my son as requested. More trendy than washing detergent but produces the same results in my opinion.
4.0,Great quality graphics!
4.0,Like this shirt. Just wish it was longer
4.0,"I love the design and look of these earrings.  They are not too small or big, but just right.  The only hick up is that they are a little heavy, but you still can't beat the look, style and price!"
4.0,"The apron seems like it's good quality, and that little ""dryer"" pockets on the side actually work pretty well. I admit I thought it was just a gimmick but my daughter appears to really like it. Cute apron, and I think it's worth what I paid."
4.0,The dress is fine the length and the fit is perfect but the tie is separately added in the box and only one sleeve is beaded and the other has no bead that’s wrong depiction of what you have on the picture online.
4.0,These are nice make they are just not easy to wear or the most comfortable thing to wear. The eye holes keeps sliding and trying to go in my eyes it feels tight around one of my eyes. The mouth hole is great. The eye part is very uneven and I think thats by design because they all have that same shape. I could see what they were going for and if excused right would have been super cute but as of right now its not practical and makes them very unportable to wear.
4.0,"For the price the slacks were exceptional; however, it seems as if the size does not fit the cut."
4.0,The sizing is impossible.  I used the measurements and ordered a large.  It was too small.  Then ordered a xxl because the other was so small.  The xxl is huge.  Too big.
4.0,It's for a Gift looks nice but haven't given them yet
4.0,"I like that they fit well nicely (XL for me, 5'11"", 180).  They are very comfortable.  I do wish the fabric was a bit higher quality and that they'd leave out the inner white liner (which seems super cheap and not as comfortable as the outside fabric)."
4.0,This sweater is a pullover not a cardigan or at least not one that opens down the front.  The material is a little scratchy but not as bad as wool.  The sweater has a retro look and gives off that vintage feel.  Great paired with jeans or a nice set of cordaroys.
4.0,I like the dress. The material was good and the length was perfect for me.
4.0,"I like these. They are larger than the ones they sell at most local body jewelry places, thankfully. My nose is too big for the ones sold locally. The only thing I do like about these is the part that goes through my nose is basically cylinder in shape (totally flat on the end that goes through the piercing hole). This makes it hard to get through the hole, wish it came to more of a point. Other than that I'm really happy. Colors came just as shown. Very happy"
4.0,Totally cute matching aprons.
4.0,I wear hats L/XL. The side stings are a little short for my head. Could be another inch or two longer. But all in all a good product.
4.0,Shoe is very comfortable.  Makes a big difference than walking on hardwood floors.
4.0,"My daughter likes it, the colors are very bright, the material is light"
4.0,Just was kind of tight. Squeezed me a little. Go a size up.
4.0,La caja en que vino embalado el producto es excesivamente grande!
4.0,I have appreciated that my mask isn't rubbing on my nose. My glasses still fog up.
4.0,The buckle pictured has a gloss/shine. The one I received is Matt Finish.
4.0,"First let me start by pointing out I got the color Apricot-green. I am unsure if my review will run true to all the colors.<br /><br />Ok, lets talk about that color first, apricot green? No, in no way is it that at all. Apricot would mean an orange shade of some sort, and nope true to the picture there is none (which is a good thing to me). Green? Well that is a bit of a stretch. The top is more black shifting to dark teals, not green. Again this isn't a problem, and is true to the picture.<br /><br />Now onto the rest, this top is perfect. I am normally a large, and this fit even looser then I thought it would, which is NOT a bad thing at all. It is very very lightweight meaning those hot summer days won't be a problem. The colors are bold and vibrant as well. I happen to have a perfect teal colored tanktop that goes perfect with this, so it is all perfect.<br /><br />Then why 4 stars you might ask? I didn't notice when I opened the package several loose strings hanging from the top. I shouldn't have to trim my garments before wearing them. This just shows a poor quality check before being packed up. This in no way stopped the top from working, all the threads were just the extra hanging off, and took but a few moments to fix, but it is something to keep in mind."
4.0,"Work well, but the longer ones would be better.  My fault."
4.0,"This bathrobe is definitely more of a lingerie item than an actual bathrobe, but it is cute.<br /><br />I ordered a size:  LARGE.<br />The way it fits: TOO SMALL<br />I WEAR: a US size M in women's, L in juniors. Size 9 pants.<br /><br />I found the bathrobe was too tight to close over my chest, but because of the design, I feel like it's not as big of a deal as it would be with other 'real' bathrobes.<br />The color (I got purple) is a bright and vibrant hue, and the satin is extremely silky. The cons that I've found is that because of this satin; it's almost impossible to actually keep the robe closed, as the fabric just slides across itself, including the tie.<br /><br />Other than that, it is cute. It's sexy. The length is good and makes my booty/legs look good (haha!)<br /><br />Overall, I like this robe. But, keep in mind that you may want to order a size larger; and that this should really be used as a sexy piece, not as one that you use to legitimately use to cover up or keep warm haha.<br /><br />I received this robe for free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,@ 1st it was tight getting my phone n2 & out of the case but when I put some foam n2 it made the case open up alittle. Now it's a perfect fit
4.0,"I'm 6'1 and about 190, and I first bought a Large. Thing is, it was too small--mostly because it was too short for my comfort (just at, or a tiny bit above, my waist). The body wasn't tiny, but it could have been roomier. I usually wear Large, but this large didn't fit so well.<br /><br />If you like your hoodies to fit snugly, it's true to size. If you're like me and want a little extra length and roominess so your hoodies fit comfortably, go a size up.<br /><br />This is also true about their t-shirts, which tend to run small.<br /><br />Otherwise the hoodie is good, it's well made and the graphics are quality."
4.0,"Pretty color, though the wires that the stones are suspended on bend easily which makes them look crooked.  Need to &#34;straighten&#34; them every time I wear them."
4.0,Purchased this for my husband and it was a bit smaller than expected. You might want to order a size up.
4.0,This perfectly matches and very good material as well.
4.0,It's a cute shirt. Looks good with the knot and folded sleeves.
4.0,"Like this dress.  It was a bit short, but I took off the tie belt (don't really like them anyway) and added it to the hem.  Gave a bit and just enough more coverage."
4.0,"You'll need fashion tape to keep the V-neck in place so you don't flash anyone, but even then, the fuzzy nature of the material makes it hard to stick to...this garment shows a fair amount of butt, so keep that in mind if you're planning on wearing this without pants. I love this because I'm 5'10&#34; 130lbs. and this bodysuit didn't ride up the crotch at all. Good amount of stretch. Fun piece, will wear again."
4.0,"Beautiful print,  great colors.  I haven't washed it yet so hoping the color will last.  The top is a bit large (or maybe my tatas are too small)  and the material could be a tad thicker.  All in all it's a pretty dress and I love the cut and style of this dress."
4.0,"I like them a lot, just a little bigger than I expected."
4.0,"Really cute print, I got the sloth on a skyscraper. The materials is shiny and kinda odd, not too warm, but it's cute and comfy. It's a bit big, I usually wear size S / M shirts, the length is alright. If you see a print you like I'd recommend, fun shirt."
4.0,I always order bigger. I am 5'4 170-180 36B/c. The dress is amazing. Super comfy. A little too long for me. I would prefer a Petite version. I lived it. The quality of the embroidery and buttons is authentic.
4.0,Fits great but fabric is very thin so it is very see through. They have the top doubled up in fabric but not the bottom
4.0,These pants.. like the the look and style good for the price. Got for work pants. So cant complain one bit perfect for what i got them for!
4.0,"I discovered the advantages of suitcase packing cubes about 20 years ago. They're splendid for organization, as ""unpacking"" in a hotel room means simply putting the cubes in a drawer; you don't have to hunt for anything since you put related items in the same packing cube; and they make it simple to separate the dirty laundry from the clean clothing. By this point, we've collected at least a dozen such packing cubes, some of which are dedicated to ""traveling kitchen"" (because yes of course we bring along our own coffee gear) or ""winter items"" (so that we Arizona people don't have to hunt for gloves when we head to cold climate). As a result, it was easy for me to say YES when Amazon Vine offered me this set of two packing cubes.<br /><br />...And they're fine. Not astonishing, not disappointing. They do the job adequately.<br /><br />The only oddity is the size and shape of these bags. Most travel packing cubes zip open all the way, so that you can fold items (say, shirts) or flip through them in a hotel room (let's see, which shirt do I want to wear today?). These open up from the top, like a generous woman's purse. You can get into it just fine to sort through your socks and underwear, but it's not quite the same as the open-flat organizers.<br /><br />The construction is good. The bright blue is visible even in a dark space. The size of the bags in the two-pack (one held a week's worth of underwear and socks, the other held my slacks with plenty of room left over); I could have squished in plenty more, if I'd needed to. The price is reasonable, too.<br /><br />So this is a useful set of packing cubes... as long as you're good with the zipper design."
4.0,Just a little too large on the top. Otherwise its a great wrap
4.0,Love this belt. I hate wearing ones with buckles because they destroy my layering pieces. This does twist a little when going to the bathroom and needs adjusting several times. But overall I’m glad I bought it.
4.0,It's ok plates real thin
4.0,"Pros: super light weight, waterproof, super cheap, compact.<br />Cons: I'm average height, sleeves are a little short on me, but not a deal breaker."
4.0,I use 2 for chaining buffalo leather samples to send to customers. They work great.
4.0,My 16 year old loves Geasy!
4.0,"bigger face that expected, nice look though"
4.0,"Typical issues for busty women. The bottom buttons part, nothing a little sewing can’t fix. I got a large and it offers no extra room, but I’m in the process of losing weight.  I just got this today. For reference, I’m 5’11”, 165lbs, and 36DD. It’s a little thin so you will need a slip, and will need to be ironed with each washing. My daughter said I looked like Snow White so I also paired it with a red belt!"
4.0,"You do get what you pay for. I have had to order a 2nd pair, my 1st died after a year. Still a good deal, just wish the traction and the soles were sturdier."
4.0,"Second hand fell off, but the minute and hour hands work fine. I took out the second hand, don't need it...very accurate and easy to read. VERY inexpensive for an American made watch."
4.0,"Very difficult to get the credit cards out of the 3 provided slots.  Other than that, it holds more than what I need.  The money clip magnet is strong and closes just fine."
4.0,It looks like a boot for little kids but my son likes it. The design could be better but it is true to the photos.
4.0,Wonderful material. Just a few issues.<br /><br />1.) Loose buttons. 3 fell off after trying on the vest. Decided to just re-sew all the buttons.<br />2.) Too tight in the chest. Bought the recommended size based off chart. Should but a size up next time.<br />3.) No way to tighten the waist. The back buttons are just for show.<br />4.) It does have pockets! Though they are sewn shut. It was a simple fix and now my vest is functional.<br /><br />Overall this is a rather good Quality Vest.
4.0,Looks great but it is snug for the size I ordered.
4.0,Item was a little bigger than size but we like them.
4.0,"I bought the red dress and it is very pretty, but I will have to say that I agree with other reviews....without the belt it's a pretty, floral trash bag..lol.  The material is nice, looks a little see through, but once it's on, you can't see anything.  One weird thing I noticed is that on the packaging it says plus size....might explain why it's a little big.  I bought it in medium.  I am 5'5&#34; about 140 lbs and a 34dd.  I probably could have went with a small.  Overall, this is very nice.  I can see wearing this a lot."
4.0,Nothing exciting. What I thought it would be.
4.0,Just wasn’t me an si love paisley but that was just me
4.0,Very compact. has a place for everything.  Great for shopping.
4.0,"Bought the beige and it is nicer in person than on the screen. Held up well in the wash and  did not shrink when dried. I am normally an XL or 1x and bought XL and it’s a great fit, not tight or snug at all. Very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"When I first saw my purse (and it was still in the clear bag ) I thought ""How pretty!"" When I pulled it out however, I soon realize, it didn't seem like leather as stated, but more like vinyl.  Maybe super fiber leather is suppose to smell and feel like plastic?  If it holds up, I don't care I guess, because like I said it's still very pretty."
4.0,Cute pants but way too small. I ordered the size I normally would purchase and could barely get them over my hips. Didn’t even try to zip and button.
4.0,"This is a beautiful hoodie, but the sweater is a very loose knit and isn't a sweater that will keep you warm.  I feel like it needs an undershirt, but maybe not a problem for some.  It has a banded bottom on the sweater so it is not a loose, open hem. That is the main thing I don't like.  I didn't want the bottom to be form fitting. I'll post a photo when I wear it."
4.0,Nice look belt strong but it does loosen up when you sit down and when you get up you get to tighten it up
4.0,Have stretched but still a tad tight
4.0,Okay  but doesn't  glow
4.0,"Very nice looking, quality is good, just what I wanted!"
4.0,"Standard studs. They are very nice. I like to use these studs when I wear oversized neck pieces. So I definitely the studs and most likely a repeat customer. However I am not a fan of the packaging. Studs arrived in a large plastic bag, each individual pair of earrings was in a smaller plastic bag. Effort is needed to unpack."
4.0,I would reccomend buying one size up from the size on the sizing chart. Was very snug when I got the size the measurements on the sizing chart reccomended.
4.0,Fun and cheap accessories. I got many questions and compliments from onlookers.
4.0,"Got this yesterday so I can't speak to longevity but the following is a detailed breakdown.<br /><br />The facts:<br /><br />1. It's so thin you will wonder if it's in the envelope. Fold a piece of paper in half twice and you will have an excellent idea of how thick the wallet is on it's own.<br /><br />2. Unless you stuff the pockets, your cards will move around a little when you open the wallet. They will not fall out unless you hold the wallet open and shake it, seriously. I just did that to try and get them to fall out and my plastic cards (4) came out of one side. My business cards stayed.<br /><br />3. It makes noise. Does it make enough noise that I'm self-conscious? No. It's a crinkly noise that you may notice in a quiet situation.<br /><br />4. It is exactly big enough to hold US Dollars. No less and NO MORE.<br /><br />My opinions:<br /><br />The reason I wanted this wallet is because I hate having things in my pockets. I carry a cell phone, folding knife and handkerchief or paper towel anytime I leave the house. If there is any way I can reduce bulk or weight I will.<br /><br />I don't care about the noise. It's not so loud that it will attract attention. Anyone who hears it will probably be so close to you that you know them already.<br /><br />No, it does not look like a leather wallet. It looks like nylon material. I got blue and to me, it's gorgeous. I value substance over form, your needs might be different.<br /><br />I chose the sport version because it's the thinnest, smallest wallet made by All Ett. Check out their site. If you want more reviews there were 39 customer reviews (on May 28, 2010) on the All-Ett Billfold here:<br />http://www.amazon.com/ALL-ETT-Billfold-Thinnest-Wallet-Ever/dp/B000E1GRIO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=shoes&qid=1275075670&sr=1-1<br /><br />I am concerned about some of the reviewers saying theirs has worn out. I'm a tough user of products so if it can break down, it will die in my hands. Still, I love the design so much that if it lasts 6 months I will probably buy another one.<br /><br />My only problem with the wallet is the spaces for the cards. They are so big that if you filled it with enough cards to keep them from falling out you will affect the way it folds. This seems odd to me since the wallet is for people who don't want to hold a lot of stuff so I would have make the pockets tighter so that they held about half or two-thirds as much as they do.<br /><br />To be fair, the spaces have an area under the top flap with little rubber half-circles that I am guessing are intended to hold cards in. But I am not impressed since they seem too smooth to provide real grip. The rubber from my Domke camera-bag strap was ten-times better and lasted for years.<br /><br />As I said, the cards WILL NOT FALL OUT but they will move. Since most people really don't seem to like the style of these wallets, I imagine that it's just the nerds that want it. And nerds notice when things move when they shouldn't. So it bothers me.<br /><br />Sooooooooooooo,<br /><br />Is it really really thin? Yes. I changed my money over to as soon as I took it out the envelope and reveled in it's tiny pocket profile immediately. I doubt I'm ever going back.<br /><br />Do I love this wallet? Yes<br /><br />Am I glad I spent $17 on it? Yes<br /><br />Will I buy it again? Yes<br /><br />UPDATE Dec_12_2010: I have traded in this wallet for a Big Skinny wallet (http://www.amazon.com/Big-Skinny-Compact-Sports-Wallets/dp/B0048FS3FM/ref=sr_1_4?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1292192271&sr=1-4).<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />The material on the All-Ett was so slippery that my cards felt loose. I hate things being shaky and had tried reversed tape, making the openings smaller with iron-hemming material. Eventually I traded in a tiny profile for more function.<br /><br />With the All-Ett, you had to get the money in just right or it would bulge from the top. With the Big Skinny I have no worries that it will hold my cash. I carry four plastic cards with me; two on each side. They stay firmly in place.<br /><br />The Big Skinny is bulkier than the All-Ett for certain but it's also sturdier and the textured finish feels great, just the right amount of slippery and textured.<br /><br />So although the All-Ett is smaller, I have given my loyalty to Big Skinny."
4.0,"I'm not sure I should be reviewing this watch at this time as I haven't owned it long enough to really judge. It keeps very accurate time if I keep it wound or wear it all the time. I don't normally wear my watches on the weekends working around the house so it was off time this morning when I went to put it on. Not hard to set once I figured everything out. The watch needs to come with better instructions on setting and how to work the band clasp. But once I figured it all out I love the leather band with a clasp. I have never had one like this, but it is so easy off and on.  Need more time to see how the watch holds up. Other than that very pleased!"
4.0,This was a gift for my daughter. Will update when she uses.  Can in quick and looks nice.
4.0,"I found this dress on another site but I would not have gotten it fast enough for my event.  I am late 50's, a size 10, and ordered the XL since a L was not available (the reason for the 4 stars). This size fitted all right, except for the bust area, so I used Fashion Tape to just hold down the wrap part by the bust.  That worked nicely.  ohhh I love the sleeves!!  They were a bit long, I am 5'2"", but they are so pretty and worked well on my shape.  I was amazed how well the dress was made for the price.  The whole dress is lined, even the sleeves.  I would recommend!  Oh, the color is gold/champagne and really pretty!  I wore hot pink slingback shoes and carried a pink clutch."
4.0,"I'm planning to wear this white dress for when I elope. It's lovely and very cute. For reference, I'm 5'4 in height, 37B in chest, 157 lbs and got the large. I think i could get away with the medium but i didn't want to take the risk in case it was too tight.<br /><br />I washed in delicate cycle, and put it in the dryer on medium heat for 30 mins. Still looks great!"
4.0,"The material is a little stiff, but it's soft.  I like the color."
4.0,pretty but the hearts sometimes falls/sags because there really isn’t anything to keep them taught against the earlobes.
4.0,"I love it, beautiful!!"
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter, who loves the movie Elf, and she couldn't wait to wear it.  fit is as expected., and the color didn't run when washed."
4.0,"Very cute dress, for the price. Definitely need a slip as it’s fairly sheer. The slit will blow open so either pin it or be aware. Mine had an extra waist tie-I cut it off. 5’6  140 lbs"
4.0,"It fits my waistline great, but had a really hard time getting over my hips. There is no give to the waistline material, so I was afraid I would rip it, but it was fine. I love the way it looks! It isn't too poofy, but has a lot of life to it. I tucked a thin sweater into the waistline, and there was no bulging on my backside. I highly recommend this product. Just keep in mind that going a size up could be wise, especially if you've got curvy hips."
4.0,"These masks are really well made. They fit me well, but if you have a bigger sized head/face, they would probably be too tight for you. I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,Its cute but rides up on mu shih tzu
4.0,Beautiful Dress and Great quality
4.0,I was looking for something to wear under a few cosplay outfits and this is just right. I'm not sure why I got Navy.
4.0,I ordered a large but it fit like a medium / small. I would say size up 2 sizes to get the fit on the model
4.0,"I purchased the 2xl after reading reviews. I obviously missed something. I'm 5'8 219... 42f. This sleep shirt swolled me up. I'm pretty sure that a large would have worked...but a xl would have more room to play in, but the material is very stretchy also."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but very nicely made don't look like the one's advertise but like I said very nice and well made thank you very much
4.0,Beautiful  but to small for a 2X. Fits like a large.
4.0,"I ordered this vampire headwear head/neck wrap after my skull one used when i'm riding my Harley began to show signs of wear and I was in need of another wrap. I chose to go with the vampire look because i've always presented myself as a male when riding before so I thought this would be a cute change/switch up to my style. When I received it, I didn't like it at all and regretted my selection. After staring at it during the cold months, I decided I liked it again. When riding weather approached, I tried it on and wore it during one ride but realized how ugly it truly is. The lips and everything appear huge, so when its on your face, it just looks a bit much. Also, my skull wrap is extremely soft whereas this one feels rough. Overall, the selection was bad on my part, but at the same time- the material can be improved."
4.0,"Nice boots, well made, received style I didn't choose. Sizing runs big."
4.0,"I loved the design on the product. It was a lot bigger at the top part than I expected, but the bottom fit just fine. I sewed in a couple of inches to tighten it up, however it was still a bit loose. I also loved how light it was. I wore it on a hot day and it kept me nice and cool."
4.0,"The Unakite bracelet has beautiful beads as shown on the advertisement. However, at about 6 1/2 inches it is short for me even when stretched. It is then still uncomfortable to wear. It would have  been even better at about 7 1/2 to 8 inches in length. But happy with the bracelet and lovely beads.."
4.0,"It is a little big in that he strap hangs down in the side of your waist is very small. Anyone smaller than a size 2 or even a petite 4 may not want this for their waist, only hips."
4.0,"It has an Asian Indian look to it, that is why I bought."
4.0,Hop rings are perfect. The studs are entirely too small. Goes right thru my piercing.
4.0,"This is a wonderful watch and definitely a classic. This was one of the first of its kind and massively popular. Over time the price has decreased now it is one of the best deals there is in terms of watches.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Price. For what you pay, this watch is just fantastic and very solid. This is a military approved watch that can take a beating, and is nice for everyday use or athletic/work use.<br />-Weight. This watch notably lighter than others, and this has its ups and it's downs, but it makes it nice because it is not a sinfully watch weighing on your wrist. Personally, I like big faced watches, but this is a nice change.<br />-Functions. On the default, there is obviously the time (with seconds), as well as the day, date, and ability to change whether it is in 12 or 24 hour format. You can toggle through to find alarm and stopwatch mode. You can set an alarm to go off at any time of the day, as well as set the hourly alarm so the watch beeps every hour on the hour. This can be a handy function when at school, work, homework, etc. when time management is important.<br />-Durability. Though it is no G-Shock (which I highly reccomend because they are great watches), it is nice and pretty durable as well. It is obviously water resistant, so swimming, showering, wearing in rain, etc. with this watch is no problem. Despite it's small size, it feels fairly sturdy and is fine to wear in tough conditions.<br />-Battery life. Though I have not come close to reaching the time for a battery change, I have learned from research as well as friends who have the watch that the battery lasts forever, which is wonderful but not exactly surprising. Since the watch is so small and simple, and it is digital, the battery on this rather than lasting the average 2-3 years, should last more like 5-10 years, which is fantastic.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Size. The first thing I noticed upon unboxing this watch was that it was noticeably smaller than I had expected. While I knew it was not a large faced watch, the face was smaller than it appeared to me on Amazon. I have gotten used to it but this is something to note if size matters much to you.<br />-Strap. The strap on this watch is decent, but by no means impressive. It is pretty thin and not one of the nicest looking bands Casio makes. It does the job and seems strong enough, though over time that may change. Fortunately, that is why you can purchase replacement and different bands for it! With the right tools they are changeable; you can do this is at most watch or jewlery shops.<br />-Buttons. The buttons are pretty small and not always easy to press. While the locations of them is pretty standard, they are small and not always the easiest to access.<br />-Appearance. Though it is a classic, that does not neccesarily mean that it looks professional or very high quality. It does not look bad, especially for the average person looking for an everyday watch or a sports watch, but for someone wanting to look professional, I think it goes without saying that this may not be the watch for you.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great watch and definitely worth the $9 or $10! It is a classic watch that is popular for a reason. Great buy and highly reccoment."
4.0,Item was smaller than labeled And ordered.  Luckily it fits my daughter.  Otherwise it is as described
4.0,Just what I wanted. Beautiful
4.0,Thread is coming out already
4.0,This was so very tiny! But very adorable! It was for my daughter's birthday and she LOVES it!
4.0,"This wasn’t as tight as I would have like it to be. The material is comfortable, soft and stretchy, but I would have preferred some compression to the fabric it’s made from.  I used it under a tunic as a base layer. For $20 I’m going to keep it but it’s missing some compression. Maybe a smaller size would make the difference? But I don’t think so."
4.0,I love this Camisole. Plan to wear it with jeans. I love the feel of the material.
4.0,"I bought it for a Halloween costume, way too tacky for me to wear more often than once a year for the fourth of July from now on. Quality shirt, seems like it will hold up fairly well."
4.0,These pajamas were super cute for Christmas morning Disney World trip surprise. They did appear to be a little small for my daughter.
4.0,"I love the fit and comfortability, but the fabric looks worn instead of new but I think it’s fine for the price."
4.0,"Wrap is cute but runs small. It's more of a triangle shape with a little tie handle so it will not give full coverage all the way around. I'm usually a small or xs 5'8 138, and a bit wide in the hips but this was too small for me. I can't imagine on anyone over size 4. I returned it."
4.0,"I really like the colors of this bag. The strawberry is more like coral, and the dune is a great complement color. The parts that are leather are Tignanello quality, as is the satin lining. The magnetic snap closure is strong. The bag easily converts from a tote style to a cinched bag, which makes it versatile. My only dislike is that the man-made trim flakes off in places. But I still love the bag and will enjoy using it."
4.0,"Is doesn't have compression is tight on the legs,  it's more like a legging  style,  but for now and the price I paid for it...Its OK.<br />Nice style and fabric!"
4.0,Fits a tad snug no grip on bottom of shoes very slick looks as is in photos
4.0,Don't buy this for the glasses. The hearing protection is great though! Used them with a 12 gauge. No issues at all!
4.0,Great socks. Would prefer to just order just one color though
4.0,it looks ok
4.0,I got this product for my husband for a gag gift for his birthday. He does a fantastic impression and I thought he would enjoy using this to mow the grass or work outside. He's actually adding this to his collection of costumes he uses for performing. He said it's so cool that no way is he wearing this outside to get dirty!
4.0,"I love the cardigan, but it does run small.  I had to return mine for the next larger size.  The fabric is very light-weight so I actually use it as a cover-up with my pajamas."
4.0,so many uses - thank you for the great price and product
4.0,"This is so cute but so thin, however i can use it over medical mask for double masking since it is so thin."
4.0,It's a nice pretty dress. Just that the cloth is a bit thin. So might not cover extra muffin tops. I got a M. Normally I wear size 6. Tall 5'4 weight 150. For the price? Really can ask too much. I still like the look.
4.0,"Soft, cute, run big."
4.0,"Love this shirt. It is a little see-through, so you may need a tank, but definitely a light colored bra. Excellent fit. Very soft material. Really shows off your shoulders."
4.0,"Cute outfit, fits really tight though,  cheap material.  I wear my pieces separately,  put a long skirts over the dress. It is a great price. After you fix it to your liking, it is worth it. Very stylish"
4.0,The botton part fits but the waist part is too tight...
4.0,Sweat suit looks exactly like the photo only &#34;it runs small&#34;  is an understatement. I am a US size 14 and I ordered the XL thinknin I'd be safe. Its like a size 7/8. I'm giving it to my daughter. Its cute.
4.0,"A little bigger than I expected , but I  still love it . Sleep with it in last night with no problems"
4.0,"Good comfort, poor adhesion, kinda pricey"
4.0,Smaller no nose wire.  Okay colors.
4.0,"Love it! Looks great, very lightweight. The only downfall is it's not waterproof and you can't wear it in the sun or it will crack. I think for $130, you should be able to wear it in the water and sun"
4.0,"They fit perfect for my soon to be 6 year old. My only complaint is that I received two of the same pattern so that is a little disappointing, other than that the quality seems good and a good fit for summer with a toddler."
4.0,"I love this skirt. Length is perfect. Gave it a 4 star though because the &#34;xxl&#34; waistband fit better around my thigh than my waist. I'm 5'6 150 pounds don't USUALLY have a muffin top, but find myself trying to hide it in this skirt. I stretched the elastic over a chair for three days before I wore it. :)"
4.0,Well made and just as pictured. Not some plastic feeling junk. We love it.
4.0,"This sports bra looked and felt great, however I ended up returning it because it was not supportive enough to be high impact.  I'm a 36D and ordered the large.  Smooth lines and a supportive fit that would be great for yoga, but there was just a little too much bounce allowance to be comfortable enough for running."
4.0,"The khaki color pants were a little more see through than I would have liked. They were the right length, but fit a little tight in the thighs."
4.0,Great dress it's just the slots for the arms are a little tight if you have bigger arms. Otherwise I love it!!!
4.0,Lots of compliments. Stylish and easy to mix with many things
4.0,"Cute cardigan, but runs small. I normally wear a 1x (or 2x at most if things run smaller) so out of concern for the fit I ordered a 3x because I wanted it to be a bit roomier. It fits great, so I'd definitely suggest to order one size up from what you usually do, or two if you want it a little roomier like me. It's nice though, so I want to get a couple more in other colors."
4.0,"These are very soft and stretchy. I do feel the back slides down slightly when bending or sitting (I bought M, my hips are about 39-40 inches around—but I feel like a size up might be too loose). Be aware that there is no additional layer of fabric or liner in the middle. I wear reusable cloth liners that I snap on, so it’s not a big deal to me, but I thought I’d mention it for other people. The main thing I wish is that one of the pairs hadn’t already gotten a hole after 1 wash. But I can’t really return the set to get another one, because I already threw out my old underwear! I guess I’ll live with it, but it’s a shame considering it was $29 to get 6 pairs."
4.0,I'm very disappointed about the color. It's says white in the description but we got a cream color shirt. Now we have to find another shirt for our event.<br /><br />Besides that the shirt is a great buy. Nice quality and design
4.0,"Built great,  wanted a top loading bag,  this zippers and loads from the side<br /><br />This review is more of a warning than a bad review,  i was disappointed in how it works,  but the bag is built very well"
4.0,Pendent was beautiful. Necklace chain broke.
4.0,Bigger than expected but very nice
4.0,Granddaughter loves the leotard.  Best birthday gift.  She loves the colors.
4.0,Product works but could be more user friendly. It woke me up at 1230 this morning and did not go off at the set time of 5 am. I will have to trouble shoot this.
4.0,It fits very nice and tight. It’s great for under pants in the winter since the lining around intimate areas are visible. Great buy! I can’t wait for the cold season! :)
4.0,Kinda cheaply made for it being almost $25. The logo is embroidered but the stamp seems to be screen printed on I think. But it's nice. The retailer is great. Buy this and go have a Lemmy.
4.0,"They were too small, next time I guess I just have to order a size up"
4.0,I felt like the Belle of the ball.  The only hiccup was that you could see my bra out the sides of the dress.
4.0,"Fit perfect for my son, ordered a 3T."
4.0,"This is a strange one, unique for sure<br />portrays the way of a cat, demure.<br />i'm five-nine, one-sixty i weigh,<br />fits as expected, and cheap price to pay.<br />it is not off-white as they seem to show,<br />its a true white, take it from this cat-shirt pro."
4.0,"Very fitted, looks very nice"
4.0,I think it's a nice jacket for the price
4.0,Cute shoe. Would be better if they made half size bigger to fit with socks
4.0,"Fits nice n snug, like the worn look bought a couple pins for it today."
4.0,"I love, love, loved this top.  I'm usually a Medium, so I ordered an XL, fit great! Looks great under a sweater.  Just washed it in my washer and pulled it out to line dry and almost all the seems had ripped!  :(. Not all together unexpected for an inexpensive blouse after almost a year of wearing & washing... Just dissappointing. 4 out 5 for seam failure! Lol"
4.0,Very neat nice and properly priced
4.0,"only worn 4 times so far, but like it. fits well. kinda narrow on the ankles."
4.0,"A good beach cover-up for summer.  Good for traveling as it won't take up much suitcase room.  Will also make a good yoga top in cooler weather.  Nice color, just as pictured."
4.0,Smaller than I thought they were going to be. Very pretty
4.0,"It's a little itchy, but it's more of a minor discomfort; you get used to it after a while."
4.0,"It pushes lol my fatty parts in great. Really smoothed me out and comfortable to wear all day. The only place I have an issue with is around my thighs it rolls up. Other than that, I really like it."
4.0,"Very flattering, but the length of the bodice is very short."
4.0,"Pretty good product, nice 👍🏾 lightweight & the bezel has a BOLD look on the wrist😎"
4.0,"Came fast, i like the look, but one post was a little crooked. All in all I'm happy with the purchase"
4.0,This is cute and the material is nice. It fits smaller than expected. I usually wear a 0 or 2 and the Small was tight
4.0,Used these for a festival I went to and they worked just fine. The knot came undone at the bottom but was an easy fix. They survived a mosh pit and people yanking on them. I wish they had an extra pocket on the back but they still did the job.
4.0,emblem stretches funny
4.0,"I wear a 6.5 - 7 normally so went with the 7.  Well, a 7.5 would probably be too big as there's room in the toe box.  That being said, I don't typically wear really thick, warm socks and these would not fit if I did.  I have a Very Thin sock on now and, considering both of these shoes are the correct size, one is particularly smaller than the other and my upper arch makes it difficult to get the left shoe on.  The right shoe goes on just fine and feels snug but ok as I write this.  We'll see if I make it through the day before having to take the left one off.  I'm hoping because they're a good leather, they'll stretch and this will just be a breaking in day.  I love the sole, it's got traction for wet weather and it's soft so not everyone knows you're coming! lol  The interior is not as supportive as I'd like but I don't intend to do an exorbitant amount of walking in these.  If I did, I'd probably take out the footbed and replace it with something more supportive of my arches.  It's a very cute and stylish boot and I love that the decoration on the side is on the inner And outer side, so no matter which leg you cross over the other, you've still got a cute boot on!  I didn't think I'd care for the elastic but I don't mind it.  Obviously it helps you get your foot in and out of the shoe but it's almost a decorative touch as well. The brushed leather material is lovely but I'm not sure how much the rain is going to affect it. Overall, the jury it still out.  One foot feels pretty nice in these and the other, not so much, lol.  After Day One: I made it through the day without taking the left shoe off!  They felt much better after a day of wear.  But, when I took them off, I had a big hole in my sock on the Right side!  You know how when you put a snug shoe on and your socks get tight around your toes.  That's what happens when I put these shoes on and, while it goes away after a bit, it's just not comfy to begin with.  That being said, I'm wearing them again today and they feel better than yesterday.  I DO love the look and the brushed leather! Updated after the third wearing:  I guess you just gotta give these a chance.  I've had them on all day and, while still a bit snug on one foot, totally wearable.  The boot keeps my foot warm even with paper thin socks and I am glad I gave them a chance!"
4.0,Great buy - thank you
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a377d343ceb19a6f818b638c3b8751db]] While I do like this outfit, I’m not absolutely in love with it.  This is one of those times where I think my expectations based on the product picture was a little skewed and I forgot I don’t look anything like the model, so it’s a bit of a different fit on me.<br /><br />This is a one piece outfit and the material is beautiful.  It’s a really pretty, soft patterned lace and I think this would be absolutely lovely on the right sized person, which is not me. I took a video of me in the outfit and it was not flattering, so I will be posting a video of just the outfit to show how beautiful it is.  This is one size fits all and I honestly would not recommend this for anyone who’s larger than a size 8.  I normally have the opinion that if you love it, you go ahead and rock it, but the way this outfit is made, if you are fuller figured like me, this is not going to fit right.<br /><br />If you are a size 8 or smaller, then you’ll definitely love this.  The material is beautiful, but it does look a little different in person.  I recommend watching the video so you know exactly what it looks like.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,"They work, and I can wear them over my rimless glasses, but to me they're too heavy to be comfortable for more than a few minutes.  Maybe I'm spoiled by how lightweight my glasses are."
4.0,Cute and click together snug a little wider than I wanted but they work
4.0,"I got this for my 10 mo old son. He weighs 17 lbs. I ordered size tag 80 (10-12 mo). It fits perfectly. I am actually not going to dry it for fear of it shrinking, it would be too small. It's a nice comfy sort of stretchy material. It also has a zipper in the crotch area for diaper changes. The only thing I don't like is the buttons on the shoulder I almost ripped it unbuttoning them, just have to be very careful and now I know."
4.0,Fit was tighter than I expected
4.0,Super cute Elf costume! My only problem with this was the Velcro back did not hold. I did end up sewing  the back closed leaving the top Velcro and it worked perfectly after that. We bought with the red and white tights and I would not recommend as they are super thing nylons.
4.0,"Very warm, but sizing seems just a tad off. Buy it EXACTLY the right size for your feet or it'll end up looking super clunky."
4.0,Very Nice pair of earings. Nice size and my wife liked them.
4.0,"The webbing on them has started to break off after owning them for less month, not a big concern for me, doesn't change anything. They work pretty well with touchscreen.<br />My big issue is that I can't give the middle finger effectively while wearing these. There are probably more important hand signals while driving... but as a Bostonian, this is critical."
4.0,"Long and very lovely, but the material seems a bit course.  Maybe it will wash out as a softer scarf, later."
4.0,"This is very pretty, aesthetic, but came heavily wrinkled and wrinkles very easily."
4.0,"Watch is much better looking in person. My only complaint is that even after removing all removable links from the band, it was still too big for my wrist. The watch is still nice enough for me to want search for another band, though.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase and I would recommend this watch for someone with average to large sized wrists."
4.0,"These boxer shorts are so light, silky and comfortable! Definitely too sheer to wear out of the house, but perfect for lounging around or sleeping in. I found the fit to be a little large - I ordered a small but it fits more like a medium. They're well-made, but I do think the price tag is way too high for very sheer polyester shorts."
4.0,"It's cute and decent. I'm a size 00/5'5&#34;/108lbs. And the fit is almost perfect. It does not droop as what I like. Other than that, materials of the fabric are good quality"
4.0,It's a good watch but it's kind of uncomfortable but besides that it's good
4.0,Usually wear large but got a size up ..which worked out fune
4.0,Ordered the 2x-3x for my husband this runs small I wear large US in men's shirts and the costume fit me. Other than that we love the costume. My husband will just have to wear his Santa shirt from his Santa costume.
4.0,"I was so pleased with this swimsuit. It fit my body nicely and smooths out your stomach area also. It has enough compression to make you feel secure in the water but not uncomfortable. Took a star off because unfortunately, it doesn't feel so secure on the side without a shoulder strap. The material bunches up a little around the top on that side and I feel like it slides down a bit. If it had a bit more compression on that side to secure your chest better, it would have been a solid 5."
4.0,Just like any other sticky bra...
4.0,I needed this for football day at the office. It's cute and different. Price was great. Am happy with it.
4.0,Overall I like this and it's what I needed for my lunch pail. It is not as wide or as heavy as one I got for my purse but it's perfect for my use. Took away one star as it had a pretty good snag in it when I got it
4.0,Dress was way too long but otherwise as pictured.
4.0,Shoe is OK. Fit too close on the toes and the strap is a bit frail. Fearing the strap won’t last and durability of product.
4.0,I really like this dress. Only it runs quite large.
4.0,These are really well made but do run a bit on the small side. My niece that wears size 5 jeans had to squeeze and wiggle into the smalls. She does have thicker thighs so that may be a contributing factor. Ordering her a size up. But I am really impressed with the quality for the price!
4.0,"The garment is fine, except hat there are no slits/vents at the cuffs and the cuff is very tight. I have small wrists too! I'm paying a tailor $20 to have the problem fixed."
4.0,wasn't expecting it to look the way it did but I still love it
4.0,"I wear this shirt for chores, hanging out, gaming.......comphy. defiantly a dolman the sleeve holes are pretty big, i wear a cami under it. My regular size is an xl fit, xxl if i want roomy. size 16 jeans. this does run small compared to tshirt size clothing but its really nice shirt...light weight."
4.0,I really love this dress but it is not for tall people. I am 5'9 170 lbs and it went maybe an inch or two past my butt. I was constantly pulling it down. The fabric is comfortable and it looks like the picture but I found it runs big. I ordered an extra large for me and a large or my daughter and both were the size of the extra large. I held them up together and they were both the same length and width. I didn't mind the bigger size being little extra loose but the large on my daughter was too loose for her.
4.0,Bought for my 10 year old to wear on 50's day.
4.0,My husband is wearing it . Even it is too big . Is still useful
4.0,"They’re proper non-skid socks, like the ones sold at jumping places. Great for clumsy toddlers on hard floors. The only downside is that they’re piling a little bit after a couple washes, but I’ll still keep them."
4.0,This product is cute. I like the way it fits. The only thing I do not like is how long it is. I am 5'2&#34; so I am not a very tall girl. I ordered a medium because that is my usual size. If you are a tall person this will fit you great!
4.0,Arrived quickly. The only problem I had was battery died first time I wore it. Otherwise I loved the watch.
4.0,They match the old shoelaces that broke but are gleaming white.  Not my shoes look like crap.  ;-)
4.0,"I bought this for a Christmas present. They are very very nice, seem comfortable. Unfortunately, I will be returning them because they are too large for the recipient. The size is European sometimes it is hard to determine the proper size."
4.0,Thanks for the update on my sunglasses and I did received them in the order it were place.<br /><br />Thank you.
4.0,I have a big butt so the back of the dress was too short… everything else fit perfectly
4.0,"Not the color blue we ordered, medium blue, but aquamarine (pale) blue. Pretty though."
4.0,"I received the socks I ordered, and they are soft, and comfortable...they also look very cool! The colors are great, although I took off one star for two pairs being so similar, when wearing the socks, one cannot tell the difference."
4.0,"Las botas son perfectas en que calientan muy bien son muy livianas y cómodas,pero en la nieve la suela deben de tener antideslizante para la nieve por qué resbalan mucho."
4.0,"Material and sole quality, Looks nice with socks too 🙂<br />Would have given 5 stars, but I believe that I could beat the price  at outlet.<br />Suggest that seller  lowers price , as customers prefer a  good  deal -<br />this isn’t."
4.0,"This vintage swing dress is true to size, however I ordered a size up because I thought I would be on the safe side. It isn’t terribly large, however I like a more fitted dress so I plan on getting it altered to have a more snug fit and give me an hour glass frame. The print itself is gorgeous and looks exactly as it appears on the picture. The material is durable and strong, yet not heavy or hot which I love! I can wear it all day and not get hot and also have a nice amount of air flow. Love this dress, it is a dress for all age groups.<br /><br />I received this at a promotional discount in exchange for my impartial review."
4.0,It's a little too long but other than that it is graet
4.0,The color and fit are just what I had hoped.
4.0,Good quality ...lf l order again at least take 2  weeks to 3 weeks before party date
4.0,"The socks are soft and the quality is really nice. But I ordered 3 pairs and there were only 2 in the package. I would have left 5 overall stars, but the order fulfillment is a bit off and it’s a bit out-of-my way to rectify."
4.0,I have only tried them on at this point.  Have not had an opportunity to wear them for any length of time.  They fit as expected and are comfortable.  I love the length and the softness.  Just what I was looking for.  Did not give them a 5 simply because I have not worn them for more than a few minutes.
4.0,Really nice! May get another color.
4.0,"I’m usually a small but got a large because of the reviews, it fits nice but the skirt is really short in the back, I’m 5’3 and 120 lbs"
4.0,"Very pretty, though they are a bit smaller than the pic . They came a month early too, so that's a plus. :) They feel a little cheap, but worth the money you pay.<br /><br />Edit: So after having these for barely 24 hours, one of the feathers on the gold ring broke off and got lost; later, the band broke along a weak spot, which stinks 'cause the gold was my fave. :/  I wasn't expecting much from these rings, since they were so cheap, but I was expecting them to last for longer than a day.<br /><br />Edit (again): The seller sent me a replacement, and it was in much better condition than the last one, no visible weak spots, etc."
4.0,"These work great and are very affordable. Howevee, they are bit bulky."
4.0,Good quality.  So large I can't wear them m so I'm gifting them.
4.0,Only thing is there was no lavender or pink!
4.0,"Pretty dress.  Fit well, just a bit longer than expected but then again im 5'2 and went a ways past my knees"
4.0,"I bought the large size suit, and while the overall fit of the suit was good, the bra cups were a little large for me.  If you're large breasted, good news for you."
4.0,"Don’t think the AN KINGPiiN Men's lapel pin is only for the guys. This line of pins is very suitable for the ladies, too. The back will clip on to a scarf, a baseball style cap, a sling handbag or most anything you want to dress up a bit with some costume jewelry. These are not high end Kardashian style but they’re fun little statement pieces.<br /><br />This is a cute turquoise  and red topiary style stickpin. Stick pins began as a utilitarian neck-ware controlling device worn by English gentlemen to secure the folds of their cravats.  Of course you can wear it strictly as a fun fashion statement."
4.0,Fits a bit odd. My torso isn't long enough for it.
4.0,I am 5’6 145lbs DD and while the top of this shirt was perfect the bottom was looser around my waist. As I wanted to wear it as a base layer under my work clothes I wish that the bottom was a bit tighter that way it didn’t gather around my waist but still a great bargain.
4.0,"You have to lotion, your feet a while  before. The feet will slip and slide in the slippers."
4.0,"...I did like the bra and read the reviews Before I ordered and paid attention to what they said...I did order the bra a size bigger since most reviews said they run small(true)...I usually wear a 34D and ordered a 36D and it fit...the strap in the back is not adjustable and once you adjust the shoulder straps there's no give, like elastic/material and I made sure to adjust slowly and not pull on them and maybe snap it, cause again the silicone has no give. My only disappointment was that the removable pad is Very thin, which doesn't give much push up, the underwire helps and you can easily buy better pads and slip them in."
4.0,"Great shirt! Although, if you're going to buy it, I'd recommend buying a size larger than you actually need."
4.0,"A nice overall bag.  I really like the separate compartment for your shoes and that this compartment has a small vent.  I also like the ability to separate your shoes from the rest of your gear.  It works great for getting my stuff from the office to the fitness center and back.<br /><br />If you are looking for a roomy bag, this may not be right for you.  I am able to get my toiletry bag, gym shorts and workout shirt in, but there isn't much room left after that.  Bulky clothing would likely be a challenge as once you put shoes in the bag, it eats up most of the interior space.  If that isn't a concern, then definitely a great choice and I would recommend to others."
4.0,"High quality strap, but a bit on the stiff side, especially if you have a thin wrist."
4.0,Super cute and very soft material but it runs very generous. I would recommend sizing down at least 1-2 sizes.
4.0,"nice soft material, a little see through. love the color. i'm 5'2 about 145-150 32DDD and the medium fit nice."
4.0,"Very sturdy, trendy glasses, ultra dark and they hold my hair back when I place on top of my hair. I bought these to basically have a cheap pair of sunnies that I won't mind if they get scratched. They're a little glossier than I'd like, I wish they were matte; but they're cute."
4.0,Nice material just not quite what I was looking for
4.0,I had bought this in light blue and it was a little big.  So this one was purchased in a smaller size.
4.0,I expected this to be a bit smallish since I have huge calves. I was correct in that assumption so they do not go as high as I would like. They do keep my calves warm waiting for the bus to go to work and running around the house though. I am quite pleased with them and for the price they could not be beat.
4.0,"These pants are very comfortable, but I wish I had ordered a size down so that maybe they wouldn't keep sliding down during my workouts. The fabric is thick and not see through, it's also very soft and breathable. Love these pants for the most part."
4.0,"Wasn't the material I was expecting, seems kind of tablecloth-like but it's still cute and my daughter loves it. Order a size 7 for my 8 year old who is small for her age. It was huge..ordered a 6 instead, still too big."
4.0,"My son loves them. The fit is good, took about a month to receive them, but one shoe doesn't hold a charge as well as the other. It will charge and come on but only for about 2hrs."
4.0,Amazing but stones are smaller that’s I thought be seeable and after a while of wearing caused breakout on neck
4.0,I’m a 34DD and I got the large. Great great support. The girls aren’t going anywhere in this sports bra. The band is a little loose but not enough to be an issue. The material is quality and you cannot see thru it and cannot see the pads.  And best of all the back straps DONOT ‘make that back fat bulge. Great buy. I’ll be buying more colors
4.0,"Nice quality and it fits as desired but beware ...High maintenance garmet. Hand wash or dry cleaning needed / wrinkles easily . Personally , Poly spandex has an uncomfortable feel as well as static  . I wish I would have paid closer attention to details but for $ 15.00  it's an o.k. blouse !"
4.0,So cute and it fits and dangles...sometimes a charm will fall out so be sure the clamps are close securely and I wouldn't recommend sleeping with it on but other than that it is super cute and shiney...love it and wear it out all the time. Will be buying some as gifts to give away...The price is awesome...
4.0,"I am a normally a small and ordered this in a medium to be safe.  I’m 5’5 tall, currently 126 lbs and 28 weeks pregnant. I think a small would’ve fit well, but the M is good and not tight at all. This dress is true to your size if you are not pregnant. The fabric is soft but the quality is not great since after two wears it started to tear below the arm. I'll never get around to mending it, sad to return it."
4.0,I love this shirt. Fits and looks great.
4.0,"I like this, nice soft material. Just wish it was longer like in the picture"
4.0,105 degrees in Texas…… gotta wear shades. Nice set of glasses.
4.0,"It was smaller than expected, which turned out to be a good thing, because I though it was going to be heavy. It look almost exactly like the picture. Unfortunately there were bits of glue on the pendant, and when I tried to take it off, it chipped the paint from the necklace. Would still probably buy again."
4.0,I liked the fit !  I got a medium a little big for me but kept it  could have gotten a Sam all  Nice material
4.0,"The only problem is the zipper breaks easily but other than that, a great buy!"
4.0,"We bought this umbrella to replace one that is several years old, but that manufacturer is no longer in business to provide replacement parts. This one was significantly cheaper (by thousands of dollars) than our original one, but it has all the same features and functionality, and it is easier to maneuver. It was quick and easy to assemble, and we were using it within 30 minutes. The canopy is thinner than our old Sunbrella canopy, but it still blocks the sun and provides the shade and beauty we need for our outdoor living space."
4.0,"They look cheap, but they serve their purpose. They have a good tint to them, and work really well as a spare pair of shades. Shipping was slow, but they came from Hong Kong, so...all is forgiven. ;0"
4.0,"Chain is a little cheap, but it is very pretty"
4.0,This light blue dance cami looks nice paired with dance tights or a pull on skirt. It allows for freedom of movement while staying in place. The material is lightweight and comfortable. Perfect for aspiring ballerinas.
4.0,This sock looks and feels well made. Comfortable!<br />I did expect more compression. Ordered correct size<br />though seems to fall slightly short of optimum compression<br />for designated 20-30.<br />Received this product on time as promised. Packaging was<br />clean and undamaged. Thank You!
4.0,"Material is really soft & light weight. Although I went by the sizing chart it seems slightly larger then I expected. That is fine, rather be that then to small. I can wear a long sleeve shirt under it and it will work great now that the weather has gotten cold"
4.0,It was a nice bracelet for the price. The fit was great - easy to adjust.
4.0,"This is a darling dress that was perfect for my teen's homecoming &#34;under the sea&#34; dance. We used a measuring tape to make sure we purchased the correct size, and it fit well. Shipping took a while, but it arrived within the specified time frame."
4.0,"Love this bag. It has a great look and feel. The only downside is the adjustable strap isn’t secured. If you need/want to make strap shorter, there needs to be small loop (or something) to secure it."
4.0,I looks good but it feels tight at the back
4.0,"I think it is a good buy, and I love how it lights up. Very pleased."
4.0,Very cute & nice quality.  The only reason that I deducted one star is because it's a little too big for my small handbag.  There's almost no room for my other stuffs to put in.
4.0,Its verry nice just like picture. .
4.0,"Hat itself seems to be made well, however - the font of the word &#34;Whatever&#34; is not bold (as shown in the picture). My order had the words in very fine/thin print. Again - the quality of the product itself is good.  I just didn't receive what is depicted in the description/ad. For the price, not a real biggie."
4.0,my daughters has a wide foot and these dance shoes are perfect for her.
4.0,"This skort is great fit in M for 125#  5'3"" frame.  As a rule one would expect this fabric to be black and white, since there is no information to the contrary.  It actually looks as though red clothing may have been washed at the same time and bled on to what would have been white.  However, it is not white and, therefore, less versatile than anticipated.  It's a shame to return it, but there are others of the same make and model to take its place."
4.0,The color is a deep burgandy/ sangria. The fir is great But i needed to insert a very thin heal liner because the inner part of the shoe gave me a blister.  That why only 4 ****. Overall pleased with my purchase.
4.0,This is a great light weight jacket to wear and it is long enough to cover long blouses/shirts.
4.0,"Gorgeous lightweight earrings, but they do not have a shine; the printing makes it appear like there's a shine."
4.0,"They are very cute! One did come broken, but nothing that glue can’t fix."
4.0,"Love the dress; however, there was dog hair all over it. So I must have gotten a return. Slightly loose at the top, but i'm not very busty, so that was expected as most retailers think that larger sizes are larger all over. Material is a little thin but not see through. OVerall, I'm happy."
4.0,I got it before  Christmas
4.0,runs a tad small - was pleasantly surprised that it was lined.  looking forward to wearing this in the summer
4.0,Soft and comfortable. Thick like a sweatpants.
4.0,"This dress looked great on my daughter.  She wore it for confirmation.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it was delivered without the belt and I didn't have time to reorder and return it before the event."
4.0,"Looks great although the wool, as should be expected, catches a lot of lint. Have a roller handy!"
4.0,Great dress! It's for my 6 yr old and fit perfect!
4.0,My daughter really likes them & they really look cool on her. Just be careful cause the small ones break real easy.
4.0,I would normally be a large. But received this jacket - too small. I will order up to the next size because it was exactly the style I need!
4.0,They are ok. I got as a gift & I pretty much expected what I got.
4.0,Cute. It’s wine colored not red and runs tad big. Am 5’6” 132 and looser fit
4.0,Beautiful saree<br />Material is good for the price paid
4.0,"Well worth the $35 I was able to get it for on a flash deal. Only issue, and it is minor, is that the battery storage pocket can't be snapped shut if the battery is bigger than 4"" x 4"" ."
4.0,"These do indeed wick moisture well, but they are not as padded as I like in a work sock.  They come packed nicely in a magnetic closure gift box and would be a great gift for someone who prefers a thinner sock.The missing pair in the photo happens to be on my feet!"
4.0,These was nice and look like photo. Worked out for my witch costume.
4.0,"I bought it for a special occasion and couldn't wear it so I cut the top off, added elastic waist band and wore a top that matched the one i had to discard."
4.0,"I really like this necklace.  I purchased it as a present.  I only took away a star because the tree part of the necklace is an insert.  Therefore, It moves around some within the glass enclosure so it is not always perfectly upright in the necklace.  It can tilt to the side which is a shame.  But I still feel the necklace is a great value!  I would purchase it again."
4.0,With my lined boots they were fine. Wearing them alone in the house the cold still came through
4.0,"For my RC crawler radio, seems cheap but strong. Perfect for my Vault-Tec themed crawler."
4.0,"Chain exactly as described, was a bit longer than I expected (but that's my fault for not measuring before ordering)."
4.0,"It's always a nice surprise to receive a package by mail.  Today's delivery was no different.  As I opened package , the vibrant color of handbag immediately caught my eye. The P/U-Synthetic leather is so realistic and the gold  molding /hardware is top grade.<br /><br />The actual size of purse was smaller than I expected,  but large enough to fit a tablet,  IPad and enough of the essentials needed. The multiple pockets and center divider are brilliant!<br /><br />Most handbags today are fashionable  but are not designed functional. This handbag is a classic timeless piece that can be worn day to night.<br />Great handbag,  great price!"
4.0,Great job! No problem replacing for different power.
4.0,Really like the style but it got super fluffy after a week
4.0,It is very pretty..
4.0,Love how comfy this hoodie is. I chose the one like the picture with the red letters but when order went through it showed with white letters. So I received the one with white letters. Not the worse thing but I’d rather have what I chose. Would have gave 5 stars if they got the color right.
4.0,"I like the fit and comfort of this dress.  I am 5'9, 185 lbs.  Hangs loose and is cool in the heat.  Hits on the top of my feet which I like.  I can tell the material is going to pill, it is very thin but again, that's why it is cool.  I would  and am purchasing another."
4.0,this is a decent hat.<br />the picture does not show the actual led bulbs.<br />That is because they are the old school bulbs.<br />It works great but the photo is a bit deceiving.
4.0,Just a little small but great fit.
4.0,"Great colors and comfortable socks, but they ru bit big. Wish they had another size option"
4.0,I wear a large to x large I ordered the XX large and it still fit tight I should have got the xxx large I returning stuff so I guess I will keep it in a drawer I really wanted this but it’s to snug for me mauve I will just give IT away  I am sad cuz I really love it
4.0,I've been using it for over a month with no issues
4.0,Could have been super cute! But it smelled weird and it ran a little small of you have a bigger chest ended up returning
4.0,"The legs are a bit snug, but other than that I like these boots."
4.0,"Love DG jeans, are little more large than others I have. Would buy again  because they are so comfy!"
4.0,Fit is a little tight but perfectly in the range. I wear this whilst kiteboarding and I only removed one star because of the zippier on the back. When wearing it with a harness the zip digs into my back. I'm going to have to unstich it and replace it with a light Velcro or perhaps  nothing at all since it's kind of pointless.
4.0,They are great quality... thank you
4.0,"I needed a longer dress than what this was, otherwise I liked it."
4.0,"Love this...larger size is great for all day comfort. I would have rated it a 5, except the nose bridge is not tacked in, so it moves when washed and must be readjusted afterward.."
4.0,It could be a little longer for plus size ladies
4.0,A bit small. Order up unless you want it really tight; otherwise i would have given it 5 stars. Glad i ordered one size up then immediately ordered all colors. Really nice and classy
4.0,"Looks good, heavy duty construction, HUGE thigh pockets. Fits just as expected."
4.0,"Perfect length that I was looking for. Comfortable to swim in. Quality heavier material, does not ride up. Nice to have a zipper pocket. I would give it a 5 star if the skirt and panty portion were attached more firmly about 1 inch below  the  waist so easier to get on, once on this is not an issue."
4.0,Works very well and a little goes a long way.
4.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Plenty of pockets, good fabric have had for three weeks wash and every three days no noticeable fade. I never give 5 star. Everything can be improved."
4.0,Good shirt for the price.
4.0,"My son saved up his allowance for this watch. He loves it. Yes, the face is a little big, but the band fits my 10 yr old just fine with plenty of room to grow. It may not be for younger kids due to size. It did come with English directions and was easy to program and set. Seems like good quality for the amount paid."
4.0,"As with the other reviews there are some minor flaws but overal worth the money in my opinion. The jacket itself seems durable and the material is decent. Rain and snow just bead right off and does fairly well with wind resistance. Been wearing it in 25-30 degree temps with no complaints. There are a few quirks that others have noticed as well and are small. But for the price it is what it is. The double zipper that pulls from the left is just a matter of habit, the hood does not come off but does fold/roll up just a little akward, there are lots of pockets but the front two are positioned higher than most coats. I followed others recommendations and bought a size bigger and it fits nicely, had I went with what I traditionally wear it probably would be a little too snug.<br />Pros: outer layer material is as advertised and seems durable (already been in rain/snow and water beads off), lots of pocket options, zippers and cords function well and seem durable.<br />Cons: no fabric on inside to cover the armpit zippers (not really a factor with long sleeve base layer), zipper pulls from left side (just a little akward), hood is nice but not removable."
4.0,"Very flattering, especially if you have extra padding around the stomach.  The ruching hides this.  I wish the bra had a little more support.  I am well endowed and even pulling the straps as tight as possible there's still much movement going on at the top."
4.0,"The ring isn't as substantial as I initially thought, but overall it looks beautiful. Very happy with this purchase given that it is sterling silver."
4.0,Fabric not as quality as expected and one apron had fabric red bleeding into white stripes but over all a cute look.
4.0,"So far so good! I only wore it once with jeans that made it more difficult for it to ride up than some pants, but I liked it so far"
4.0,"I ordered this to wear for a Kentucky Derby party, love it when it arrived but it fit too tight.  I believe the size runs small."
4.0,My only dislike is that it doesn’t stay on my head through the night. I plan to try again with pins or clips. The fabric is truly a softer silky feel rather than the crunchy satin feel that similar products have.
4.0,Nice wig for Halloween. Comfortable and fits well without a wig cap.
4.0,Good-looking product too bad it was too small my wife and my daughter aren't too different in size and they were too small for my wife and too big for my daughter. You probably want to go up a number size and up two cup sizes
4.0,love the design!
4.0,Seems to be as described
4.0,"Very pretty and delicate bracelet. 4 stars because is extremely thin (and honestly, I think the only part of the bracelet in sterling silver is the leaf) and I am afraid it will break, but it looks awesome. If you have an 8 or 8 1/2 inches wrist, it may be a little tight"
4.0,"I bought this for my mothers birthday because she is a huge Alice fan. The necklace is beautiful. It did arrive discolored, but luckily I was able to polish it with jewelry wipes and bring it back to life. Normally I would have returned it, but it being so unique I didn't want to right away. I guess it had been in storage and from not being used discolored a bit. No big deal. I'm thankful I was able to fix that. I would most definitely recommend this necklace."
4.0,very light material.
4.0,"i like this a lot, billabong always has good winter fleece items, this is no exception. my only two problems are the neck flaps have some sort of canvasy scratchy material that isnt really comfortable or flattering, and the little cuffs around the arms which i personally dont like as they rub on my skin and its the same sort of uncomfortable material used on the neck flaps. i wish the fleece continued around the wrists so it was extra cozy. otherwise it is a great pullover, a bit oversized but i wouldnt size down."
4.0,I got this for my brother and he loves the jersey. I just wish we received the one with the correct name.
4.0,"I actually LOVE these even if they are excessively XXL... they're super cute!!<br />They're very comfy if you have the straps adjusted and wear fitting shirt under. I'm 5'6&#34;/136 and these fit like an XXXL. Hoewever they're NOT too big to wear . I live on over 4 acres and was always looking for a &#34; go-to&#34; pair of overalls that I could easily throw on to garden , and do my painting and crafting in our yard. These are perfect as well as kind of adorable !! I'd even get another pair in another style or color! :)<br />Just have to get used to them being so baggy... they're baggy like hospital scrubs or, how I've seen people living in the Dept. Of Corrections , lol :p still LOVE THEM!! Shipping was very fast !!"
4.0,"My owl is colored differently than pictured, but it is still a really pretty top. I was bummed that it seems to run small according to the size chart given. I was also irritated that the bottom of the tank is not hemmed. I know over time it will roll, and sometimes that gets ridiculous. Time will tell.<br />The owl is awesome, so I am keeping it."
4.0,"Nice hats, very warm perfect for 12 degree weather - the headband itself needs to be pulled a little tighter - but I have a small perfectly formed head - so I wear a scarf under the hat - if you have a big head buy all of them that you can get!!!!!!"
4.0,"I'm a petite adult that usually wears small or size 5 underwear, and the XXL fit comfortably snug. I've washed them once, and so far the seams are intact. I tested absorbancy by spreading a couple tablespoons of water into the lining, and it absorbed slowly. I think it would work best for light spotting or small leaks."
4.0,"I purchased the Grey Blue in size Small. I typically wear a M to L in women's tops, 36c bra. I've purchased a few henleys on Amazon in size large because they tend to run small. With this top I read the reviews and checked the size chart and ordered down. The measurements in the chart are accurate. On me the small was kind of slim fit but not tight anywhere, if I wanted a fit like the model then I would need an XS. It is tailored in slightly through the body so it's not sewn completely boxy/straight up and down. The rib knit fabric is thicker weight and really stretchy. Overall it appears to be quite well made and will be good for cooler weather. I would recommend but definitely suggest ordering at least one size smaller."
4.0,Love the narrow band but leather isn’t great quality however it was a great price!
4.0,"Overall, I'm happy with it. Not as great as I hoped, but I'm not disappointed.<br /><br />Pros - cute. Love the print, good length (although, would not recommend with leggings)<br /><br />Cons - not as soft and flowy as I hoped. I ordered the white floral, it's a bit see through. Wear with an undershirt or nude bra.<br /><br />Size reference, I'm 5'4, 180 lbs, 14/16 pants, large/XL tops. I ordered this in a large"
4.0,Great for someone who travels extensively - really keeps you organized.
4.0,Just what I wanted to clean tarnish from metal. Decent price for a large piece that should last for good time.
4.0,I like it but the fit on my bust is a bit awkward. I'm a 32 DDD and it doesn't seem to be made for the possibility of a dramatic bust.
4.0,"Cute dress! I loved this pattern and colors. Dress is soft material & a little longer than expected, but that is ok. I ordered XXL since I am a heavier woman but I was pleasantly surprised at how flattering it is! Would buy again in different colors/patterns."
4.0,I put a prescription lens and it is fine. It is the right size for my face. The only negative is that the temples are a bit flimsy.
4.0,"I do like these. They do keep the cold wind out of my ears. They are a bit snug, but nothing I can't deal with, they will stay on.  They are true to color. The color you see, is the color you get. The furry part makes my ear itch a little but that is probably me, and the not the ear muffs. They are a little adjustable. Just makes it to the bottom of my ear fully extended. They do cover the whole ear all the way around. Not sure how they will be when I wear earrings, because of the snuggness, I will have to get back to you on that one. ( My earings are in a packed up box somewhere ).  I can recommend these because they do their job. The snuggness keeps me at the 4 star level. I would suggest to the maker to leave the fur around the outside edges and on the outter side and the part that touches the ear, use some other material so even those with allergies could wear them."
4.0,"This is a great band.  It is easy to change out on the Fitbit Charge 2.  My only reason for giving it the 4-star review vs. the full 5 is that the color is not really what I was hoping for.  Here it shows a very pretty true pink color, almost with a slight mauve to it, but the pink I got was kind of a pepto-bismol color, not quite as pretty, and therefore I don't wear it as often as I expected that I would.  Instead, I wear the white one all the time, which I sort of bought on a whim.  I will review that one separately.  But for the function and idea of changing out the color, these are great and a terrific value!"
4.0,"I love the color and quality of the sweater!!  The color is a vivid blue and the quality is excellent.  But the sizing is off, the size chart is useless.  I don't like my tops to be snug so I intentionally ordered a size up and it's still snug but not tight.  I'm going to keep it because I'm hoping it might stretch just a little after washing."
4.0,I'm new to the Pandora charm stuff. It looks good to me.
4.0,It keeps your foot dry while protecting your toes.
4.0,"Works really well, can't complain.  Pretty good price too."
4.0,It's beautiful and super comfortable. It doesn't &#34;breath&#34; well.
4.0,Nice product. True to the color on the website.
4.0,Very clear lenses. Comfortable fit. They feel a little too delicate.
4.0,Not bad but not breathtaking. Fits the purpose.
4.0,I got the wrong size and returned them so this is not fair review. their probably ok
4.0,"Blouse is very tight (small), and the best of the dress needs to be altered as it's for a big busted woman.  Other than that, it fits beautifully.  Very well made and of high quality."
4.0,The stones are larger than expected and one of them was falling out but it was easy to put back in.  I love the earrings and would recommend them.
4.0,"2/15/2017:  Update<br />This seller reached out to me after I left a review stating it wasn't what I expected as far as the large polka dots.<br />This dress is comfortable and I am able to dress it up or dress it down.  The dots are larger then expected, but other then that, thank you for this considerate seller who reached out to me to make sure I was happy with the product.  I will be purchasing from this seller again.<br /><br />A lot of material that feels nice on and love that there are pockets.  However, what's advertised is much much  smaller polka dots. What I received were big polka dots on a black background.  Ugh!!!!!!!"
4.0,"Comfy & a perfect fit, however, the insides are not finished well. For a $20 pair of socks, I expected them to be finished nicely, & not have a bunch of strings hanging out, throughout the sock. While this doesn't effect wearability, it's still disappointing. Hopefully it won't cause unravelling in the wash."
4.0,This was a prefect choice for my. I love the way if fitted my just right for my big boned body.
4.0,Love them wish was little bigger but over all love them :)
4.0,"These glasses arrived in a nice velvet pouch. That was a great surprise.<br />The glasses were a little too small for my face, but look great on my niece. They seem like they are a good quality. The arms seem sturdy, as well.<br />When I tried them on, everything seemed to have a green tint. That might be just the type of lenses. I don't like the green tinge, but my niece doesn't mind it. In fact, she wore them today, on a very sunny day and said they worked well.<br />Overall, i would recommend these glasses. However, i think they are more suited for a smaller face.<br />I received these glasses at a discounted price in return for my honest, unbiased opinion."
4.0,I like very much.
4.0,"The dress is lovely, however its too tight and too short, would love to find items fit for a senior citizen who like their knees covered. Most clothes theses days are for young people."
4.0,Soo Pretty..
4.0,Good solid hoodie that is pretty comfy.
4.0,"My son has paws, Barney Rubble feet, whatever you would like to call them. He measures a EEE. We never find shoes that are wide enough. They all have to be broken in. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger, expecting that no cleats are really wide --  like shoes are wide and I didn't want them to be too long like clown shoes. I highly recommend trying some on in a store before buying so you get a sense of what you're working with and can make an educated guess. Definitely won't get two pairs of socks in the shoes (one on, one over the shin guards).They are better than I expected, though. If you loosen the laces, you have enough to tie one bow. The material is thin, not really stiff and hard. They have broken-in easily. But, I don't expect them to last more than one season. They came with 5 sets of laces in different colors."
4.0,"Despite the other reviews, I actually liked this dress. I am a size 14/16 and the X-large fit perfect with room still left. The straps a slightly long, so if you are shorter the straps may slide. I will say the grey one can get dirty fast at the bottom because it kinda drags due to length. But the other colors are easier for me to clean."
4.0,I really like this product. I would recommend a longer one if I was to oder again. Fabric is just ok or I would have given 5 stars. But overall good product for the money.
4.0,"This beanie is warm, adorable, and works great. My only complain is that it's a tad snug."
4.0,"I loved this shirt when I first bought it but when I washed it, it lost it's shape. I still wear it around the house .I love the design."
4.0,Good for the price. Love the pattern. Soft and cute on my baby girl.
4.0,Run very big
4.0,"I like these , and would have loved them if I didn't have to alter them. To long in the length for me but easily remedied with some scissors. I'm 5'8"" someone shorter may look like their wearing capri's."
4.0,"Super long, which I love. I'm 5'8, and 120 ilbs and the size small fits perfectly.  I can wear it with heels, and it drapes magically to the floor. The size small is 46' long.<br />Super soft.<br />The only thing I didn't care for is that it has a skinny band of elastic at the very top. I feel the elastic as I'm wearing it, and am considering removing it if I can."
4.0,washable
4.0,"Cute dress - I ordered Medium, according to size chart, but had to send it back & reorder small, & it fits fine. For reference, I am 5’5”, bust 36 B, waist 28”, hips 37”. Thus, I would suggest ordering down a size."
4.0,"Have only had a chance to try these socks, but happy so far with them. They r thinner than most."
4.0,I bought this for my wife and daughter and it was quite sturdy and heavier than i expected. My wife and daughter both wear them and they love them. I would definitely recommend these as a non-expensive item.
4.0,"I bought this jumper for my son for Halloween (he was March Hare). It's really soft and warm.  Great quality for an awesome price. He likes to wear it on cold days.<br /><br />Update: Having this rompers for a few months now,  the only issue I have is the bottoms surrounding the legs keeps unbuttoning. It gets a little annoying after a while."
4.0,It was very different and classy but a little bigger in size for me. That is why I gave it a 4 and I got the white one but other than that I was hpoping to wear it more regular or everyday than miminal occasions because of the size. Less casual and more dressy with class gaudy or flashy.
4.0,"Cute... There is a little too much space in the crotch area making it look a little strange, but my two year old loved them and they were packaged very nicely..."
4.0,"I love the skirt, the color, and the design.  The only issue I have is SIZING. I have returned several of them because the sizing is about 2 clicks &#34;off&#34;; where I normally wear a size large, I have to order this product 2 sizes larger."
4.0,"I expected it to be a little looser, but with the shorts i bought i dont mind it being tighter. Also expected it to be a little longer, but oh well."
4.0,Coolest looking chain I own!
4.0,I like a loose shirt and normally wear an ex lrg<br /> It was a little snug but ok<br /> Next time I would get the next size up. Basically a nice long sleeve top.
4.0,Not a full as I would have liked it to be.
4.0,"I really wanted to give 5 stars since I love the look, material and fit ,but couldn't because it is longer than expected and I am 5''10."
4.0,This hoodie is lightweight and very comfortable.  Great for cool days or evenings.
4.0,"It fits perfectly.  The only issue I have is the slit at the back, it's a little too high for me."
4.0,An adequate golf shirt at this price point although I am very glad I don't have long arms.  The sleeves are too short.  The shirt is cheaply made but I get what I paid for.  threads sticking out
4.0,These socks are okay quality-wise. I just find them very difficult to keep on my foot. They're always wanted to slide off my heel.
4.0,"I got this sweater and was so excited till I put it on. I ordered a medium which is one size up- and it just looks like a slightly large sweater. I really wanted the oversized look you see in photos. I am going to keep it because it’s soft and comfortable, it’s just not the look I wanted. I will probably order it in an extra large in a different color..<br />For reference, I am 5’6” and 135lbs, a 32D and 36-28-39. The medium fits like a regular loose sweater."
4.0,"They help but make everything look yellow. Takes some getting used to, helped my photophobia get under control I don’t have to use them anymore. Got my mom and aunt a pair since they also have photophobia they like them"
4.0,Bought this for my boyfriend. I sized up to be on the safe side. Glad I did because it fit perfect. Hes usually around a 4x. But I got a 5x so it would fit good plus in case it shrinks alittle when we wash it....its nice. The coloring isnt as bold as the picture depicts but that's not an issue its still an awesome shirt he loves it and has worn it 3 times.
4.0,I like them but they are a little tight for my &#34;manly hands and arms&#34; They work just fine =D
4.0,"This shirt certainly runs large.  I have the size Medium, and it measures 20.5” across at the bottom.  It’s made from 100% polyester.  It’s a very “loose weave” meaning you can see light when you hold it up. . . which means it’s an “airy” sort of shirt for warmer weather.  The length measures 31” from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  There are “slits” on each side of the bottom.  The back is the same length as the front, which in some cases the back is longer on a polo shirt. .  but not this one.  The neck is tag-free.  Made in Lesotho."
4.0,"Really liked these socks, but had to order them twice because the first pair had a defect."
4.0,It was lovely
4.0,very nice and looks dressy
4.0,Sleeves are a little too long. I’m keeping them as they provide  cover over clingy shirts hiding bulges on a full figure and give a classy look when paired with tights.  They are very thin and came with many wrinkles that were hard to get out even with steam.  I assume those will go away with first wash.  Overall I am satisfied.
4.0,"I ordered a size larger than I normally wear being that many items on Amazon run small. The dress fit correctly, had I ordered my usual size it would not have.  The material is thick and feels good and on the right figure would look very attractive. The zipper moves smoothly and the whole dress feels to be good quality.<br /><br />Sadly, it does far too good at showing off the belly and butt and my bulges from children are not flattering to see in this dress. I intend to keep it for photos, some young lady will want portraits and come in wearing something totally awful and will end up looking stunning in this."
4.0,"Very nice material! Fits superb and looks lovely on! My measurements are 34,28,35. Upper arm girth 11&#34;."
4.0,"I bought this shoes for my little brother's birthday and he absolutely loves it.<br />I have no cons for this product except for the shoe size because it turned out a little bigger than expected.<br /><br />But overall, this shoes has a very nice design and it is very light!<br />I think it's a great shoes for little boys to wear."
4.0,I bought them for fun and turned out they looked very elegant. They were comfortable as well. I took one start out because one pair was missing both of its backings.
4.0,They are great .
4.0,"TLDL: Not comparable to Crye (where color ""cp"" comes from), decent basic camo pant for playing in the woods, difference between sizes is very big. Returned due to poor fit.<br /><br />If you are looking for a camo pant with a few extras, this could be a buy.  The camo pattern is good.  Extra stretch in crotch, back and knees makes the pants more comfortable.  The stretch as helps in movement.  Stitching is decent.  Fabric is doubled in areas of high wear.  Stretch fabric is lighter in color than i would like.  For the price, I had no complaints about the pants.<br /><br />This pant is not a Crye pant.  It's price reflects that.  The quality of the material and stitching also reflects the price.  For a weekend camping trip pant, this will probably be all you need.  Again, this is not as good as the original.<br /><br />I bought both large and xl.  I ended up returning both.  It wasn't the quality of the pant, but the fit.  The large fit well everywhere but the waist.  Just a bit too tight.  The xl felt like i could fit another person in the legs. The xl waist was comfortable but only after cinching down the adjustment straps to their limit.  There is a big jump between sizes.  Not only does the waist size increase, but also every other dimension.  Either a little tight or marshmallow man."
4.0,"At first I thought these were super cute but sadly the material is very cheap and it looked like it had been washed a 100 times after a few hours. The pattern, the whole legging looked worn out. It’s also usually baggy around the crotch and upper thigh area.<br /><br />These are now going to be my frumpy house leggings because they’re still EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE."
4.0,Better have help putting it on and taking it off the catch is very difficult to put on and off by one person
4.0,Likes: pretty dress and the ruffles really give it that look. The small amount of gathering in the mid section<br />Iffy: the material is a little see through and definitely will have to wear black undergarments
4.0,Very good for Price’
4.0,"My daughter really like this sweater, but I do think it is a little over priced for the quality you get. It isn't bottom of the line, but I would say middle of the road and almost 30$ is slightly more than I would expect to pay. But overall it is a solid purchase with a beautiful color and style. I still give it 4 stars because she loves to wear it."
4.0,"Well made with scraps in the back to secure the belt without untying. It is comfortable and good quality elastic, wont roll and stays in place."
4.0,Not as well made as I would have liked but I like the color and the arrangements of pockets.
4.0,Is good if you just gonna walk around not really to be running around with them you would lose them 100% but is really cute
4.0,"The wallet is very well made.  I have,however, had problems with change falling out on several occasions.  It’s slso very hard to get the credit cards out of the slots but hopefully this will get better through useage"
4.0,"I expected this shirt to be smaller than it actually was. I ordered an XL because I didn't want the arms to be too tight or my bust to splay open the sides, but was surprised at how large the XL was (larger than some U.S. brand XLs). The material is super soft and I really love the shirt, a bit boxy , but that could be because I bought too large.  I was concerned from other reviewers that the fabric would be too shiny, but it wasn't, it's just not cotton...(I think all rayon, but I cannot recall the tag).  I'll be buying more, a size down, (my usual size for something I want a bit flowy)."
4.0,"I didn't pay attention, so I didn't notice that this was a replica of the brand Listen Flavor (that's totally my bad), but this hoodie is super comfortable and cute! You have to attach the sleeves yourself when it arrives, which is super complicated, and the string included doesn't match the color of the print or the ribbon (and the ends of the ribbon are unsealed, so they were fraying upon arrival), but besides that, I love this! I'm 157 cm tall and have a 98 cm bust, but it's still loose on me and reaches the very top of my thigh when pulled down. I'd say people of up to 110 cm bust could fit this comfortably."
4.0,"Overall, i love it. Only complaint is that the shirt is a snug fit around the torso (no im not fat). Not sure if its designed to fit like that or not. However, it is very warm and does exactly what i need it to do. I would (and have) recommend this product to others"
4.0,The fabric is great. The cut on the back to hide your bra is to high to actually hide the bra. And when I opened it the hip straps had come off. I was really hoping this dress would be the one. :(
4.0,"These bracelets are cheap.  They look good enough, were delivered quickly, and are fun to wear.  They won't last if they are worn days on end but are fun for the occasional wear."
4.0,"Came quick, very pretty, fit well. Only issue is there was a small hole in the seam. Overall, pretty happy with it."
4.0,A bit smaller than I anticipated but really good
4.0,"I absolutely love the look of these glasses! Very retro, and they give me Lana Del Rey vibes. The only thing is, if you’re getting the pink rims and pink lens, note that the pink is a gradient, and that it doesn’t protect your eyes from the sun very well, but it does give the world a pretty pink hue."
4.0,"NOT as large as I had hoped from the stated size.  But, well made with lots of pockets.  Strap and bag are 2 different colors."
4.0,"These pajamas are cute and comfortable! They are not too heavy, but do help you stay warm on a chilly night."
4.0,"This is a wonderful top.  I got several comments at the party I attended.  The black tank worked wonderfully with the brown glitter overlay.  I received it all scrunched up in a small envelope but it wasn't wrinkled at all.  It laundered beautifully, again with no wrinkles.  My only drawback is it does shed glitter everywhere even after washing.  However, that won't stop me buying another in a different color."
4.0,They didn't fit up my ear as pictured. &#34;Crawl&#34; or whatever. But they look nice as dangle earrings. Pretty sparkle.
4.0,"The quality is amazing, thick and soft and not see through. Perfect for my bachelorette party. The top is super adjustable as you just tie the sides together in the back. The bottoms however are tight and the braided strands dig in to my hips. I’m typically a small on top and a medium on bottom though, so it was so be expected. Overall definitely worth the price and highly recommend!<br /><br />I’m 5’7 and ordered a S, my measurements are<br />Bust: 32” (32b)<br />Hip: 35”<br />Butt 39”"
4.0,Keeps my shades safe & that's all I need.
4.0,These are so cute.  Only wish they had the 'no slip' inserts
4.0,"Tight but flattering, can't wait to wear it!"
4.0,Design is very cute. Husband 34. I got him medium. It didnt fit. Quite snug. Shoukdve gotten him large.
4.0,Looks good but thinner than I thought it would be.
4.0,"Fabric is a good medium weight, color was basically true to product photo, possibly a little deeper. GREAT Light-to-midweight layer, great true-waist cut (at least on me - 5'7''), very flattering over full A-line dresses and skirts with proper waists -- would definitely recommend."
4.0,Would have liked it to.be a little longer. It is comfortable and a little flirty.
4.0,material is a little odd feeling but with a tank top under it the shirt does the trick
4.0,Sent to a friend for his Caps sweater to commemorate their win. He likes.
4.0,"Super cute! My first pair of Vans. So far not as comfy as my worn out converse, the edge of the sole is so squared it trips me occasionally, but they feel much more cushioned."
4.0,So far so good.  Once my daughter helped me figure it out - no directions - everything in Chinese.  It really wasn't that hard and used it last night with Waze and could see everything I couldn't before.
4.0,Scratches very easily but they're nice
4.0,"These are pretty nice, but they run a little long and the plastic thingy between the toes was not comfortable.  I'm returning them."
4.0,"I've had this bracelet for a few months and I really like it. It's so lightweight  that I often forget that I'm wearing it 24/7. The one drawback is that there is little room for engraving on the back which will only fit about 15 characters in caps. The silver hasn't tarnished, it's durable and pretty."
4.0,This product is for Christmas gift
4.0,Wrinkles don't come out
4.0,"I am pleasantly surprised at how well I like this. I am always leery of these knockoff brands because so often they are made in such a way as to be the exact wrong fit for a hourglass figure. I bought this to go with my easter dress since we live in New England, and it was chilly this year. It's a little big in the body, but I have long arms, so I needed the extra length in the sleeves of the larger size. It has a smooth hand, and a nice drape for light sweater knit, and fit well over the girls without gaping too much at the lower back."
4.0,These pants are so comfortable. Plus the convenience of putting phone in the pockets let's you be able to use your hands.
4.0,Item arrived as expected and works as promised.
4.0,Super cute and soft tshirt I pair with grey joggers when bringing my son to preschool or doing some errands. It’s only 4 stars because the “Mom3” print has faded a little after washing a couple times
4.0,Cute and good product.
4.0,Love these bras good fit very comfortable. My only complaint is I wish the padding was sewn in or simply a part of the bra itself. It’s a pain to find them in the back of the bra or in the dryer it would be easier if the padding was part of the bra and not a separate insert otherwise great product
4.0,"Good sound quality, and works through walls a bit. Starts to get a bit iffy if you drift too many corners from the source.<br /><br />The hat fits kinda larger than I like. I've got a smaller head to hair ratio, and it brings this to light. (But most beanie caps achieve this.)<br /><br />I like that the device is removable. I've put it into my helmet for Bluetooth sound. The beanie is too bulky for this when paired together."
4.0,I say it was a little small but I'm small and I have super long legs but other then that I love swimming with this;) good an and arm workout I got the green but it's more of a teal and that's exactly what I wanted teal
4.0,nice item very pleased
4.0,Pretty much what you'd expect for the price. Great shades for day to day wear
4.0,Excited to wear these for Christmas!
4.0,It’s kinda big but hopefully it will shrink in the wash
4.0,The shape and design are super cute! The only downside is that the nose pieces bend really easily!
4.0,A bit tight around the arms but the rest fits fine.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, boyfriend loves it. Its feminine, flirty and cute. With that said, by the end of the day i noticed it tore from the underarm area, both sides!!! It felt a little tight from the shoulder but not enough to tear but it did. I had to fix it myself but looks great in summer!"
4.0,Fast shipping exact like picture
4.0,"I do not have a small face and these fit me well! Does not pull my ears down! Only thing is sometimes the print on the masks is slightly off center so I have a cute cat mouth but a teensy bit to the left or something. Doesn’t bother me too much though! They are soft and comfy. Could do with a wash upon arrival though, kinda smell like chemicals at first"
4.0,good color and size was right on.....
4.0,The fabric is very lightweight. Good for layering over something silky that it won't stick to.
4.0,I really like it. It almost holds all my cards.
4.0,"I ordered several of these belts in about 6 different colors. They look great, but the only complaint that I would have is that the elastic is not a firmer elastic, so they make me look fat, since they are a little over sized compared to the ones I had purchased in Korea, because the elastic is not firm and tight enough. The lack the elasticity that I would expect and the amount that they stretch, and the firmness in which they stretch is really not like what I expected because I compare them to the ones in Korea that are the exact same design, but have been made with far superior quality of elastic. The only think I do like really is that the variety of colors is nice."
4.0,the dress is well made and cute. I have to have it altered though because i'm a little thicker in the waist than the plus size allowed for.
4.0,Perfect size. Holds my glasses and wallet.<br />However I only started using mine in July and already the strap is broken. Can anything be done?
4.0,I’m 5’6 160lb 36DD and it hits too short above text ankle for my liking
4.0,"Very pretty and good quality, especially for the price!"
4.0,Lovely and elegant gift. It was packaged nicely.
4.0,Very comfortable<br />Stays on feet well<br />I would go 1/2 size bigger than normal
4.0,"I wear it daily, the buckle is tough and the leather hasn't frayed yet."
4.0,"Works well but it could either be a little wider or made to expand a little wider.  Will work for most of my shoes but it is still a bit small at the large end of shoe size range, especially for some shoes cut wider to begin width (but not wide size).  It all depends how your shoes are cut.  Will likely need a pair for the next shoe size larger.  Length wise it has a lot of expansion room so no issues there.<br />Seems to be excellent quality, these should be a good investment."
4.0,Bought a 2x was a little too big but it’s beautiful on
4.0,"It's nice, but it was a little smaller than expected"
4.0,"After ironing, it is a good fit & unique material for Spring & Fall"
4.0,"This jacket is good quality, super cute and super soft, she absolutely loved it! DEFINITELY worth the price! The reason for the 4 stars.. the jacket is roomy and comfy however the waist is very tight, I ordered a medium as this chick is pretty tiny but prefers roomy clothing and the waist was so tight she was unable to wear it around her hips like she usually does. That being said, she wears it around her waist and it fits snugly but she's ok with it. The tail and ears are friggin ADORABLE. So far, there's no pilling. Not sure if she's washed it yet so I've no idea if it stays fluffy after washing. Will try to remember to update once that happens. Buy a size up and you'll be good to go!"
4.0,"The line should say ""Don't worry, I have a plan."" The word ""Warry"" is a word hardly used in english any more. And while it is technically appropriate, one shouldn't have to pull up a web dictionary to prove it isn't a typo.<br /><br />Kudos though for adding a new word to my vocabulary though. Was going to be a 3star review as I thought it was a simple typo."
4.0,"As a whole, I was pleased with this purchase. That said? Order on the big side, because this runs a little small. I ended up punching two new holes in it and it barely fit for a size 40 even though it said the size I ordered was good up to size 42.<br /><br />It doesn't say anywhere on here, but it DOES include the rosary and cross, so that was an awesome surprise as I wasn't sure if it would be included or not.<br /><br />Overall, this belt is awesome and I'm glad I was able to get it in time for my costume!"
4.0,"The mask is actually fun to wear, it has many positives but only a few negatives. Like any other mask it has it drawbacks. This mask is VERY hard to breathe out of. So if you wear this mask I would not recommend wearing this during ANY physical activity. I also wouldn't recommend wearing this during the summer or any hot rooms because you will feel exhausted and will sweat a lot while it is on your head. The mask its self is cool looking & fun. The bottom jaw really moves when you speak and that is great because many masks don't have that feature. This is a cool mask for Halloween or to wear on camera. I give this mask a 4/5"
4.0,Nice colors. Fit great.
4.0,Loved the look of these! I’m usually an 8 long or 29 long. Athletically built so I have a larger bum and these fit everywhere but the butt. Like it felt like you would almost needed an inverted butt to fit into these things. 😂 If you are built similarly I suggest sizing up atleast one size maybe even two. It may be super baggy in the thighs and down but that’s the intended style anyway!
4.0,A little on the small size but very adorable.
4.0,"I wear night shades all the time because we have a street lamp that shines into our room at night, so these are perfect they block out the light just as the description had said.  They are comfortable to wear and have a strap for adjusting to your head size.  I do like that they came with 2 so that I can keep one with my travel case.  i didn't need the ear plugs to i can say how they are.  overall I would purchase again from this company."
4.0,slightly smaller than expected but still cute and easy to organize make up.
4.0,"I should've paid more attention to the description because I was expecting the dress to be made of t-shirt material, but it's made of spandex- like material. It fit me like Spanx, so I gave it to someone smaller, lol. On the plus side, it did look exactly like the picture and if it had fit me better I would've kept it. It also arrived really quick. For reference, I normally wear a women's 12 or L, with a 40DD bust, pretty &#34;hippy&#34; however not much butt, and am 5'2&#34; and it was quite tight, especially in my chest area, and knee length."
4.0,Bought these for my son & he really enjoys them. He hasnt had any problems with discoloration and wears them all the time.
4.0,The glasses are relatively comfortable and the lenses seem to be of good quality. Unfortunately the frames do not work with my wrap around ear buds. Also the nose rest is quite uncomfortable . I removed it and it is still uncomfortable . I use the glades for eye protection while executing and would assume that they are not going to be pleasant on long bike rides..
4.0,"This is a great replacement band. It really looks good with my black Fenix 5.<br />Here is what I like: The general quality of the band. I saw some other leather bands with similar price but the quality was not even close to this one.<br />And, of course, there is always a ""but""... Here is what I don't like: In the description of the band it says it will fit wrists from 6.1in to 8.7in. Yes, but it does not have enough holes to support it. My wrist is 7.25in and I had to make two extra wholes.<br />It would be perfect if it came with two or three extra holes."
4.0,"This is a very unique and beautifully styled dress. The detail of the flowers are done very well and they are intricate. They are not just iron on patches of flowers you see on some cheaper dresses. The bodice could have been a little tigher seeing as the sheer part of the dress was made to be loose fitting. If the waist was just a tad tighter I believe the dress would have flowed more nicely but I can have it altered. The length was perfect for the heels I paired with the dress. It still grazed the ground when I walked but nothing that messed up the hem. The arms of the dress were a little tight but I would rather them be tight and form to my arm than loose and become misshapen. Be careful if your arms are a little fuller because you can tear the arms. Overall, I enjoyed this dress and would reccomend."
4.0,A bit small and not too flashy it’s plain but nice for the price
4.0,"Great size, perfect color.  Have received so many compliments, even from those that pay more for their purses.  Have now passed it on to my niece."
4.0,perfect fit super cute and overall great
4.0,"I picked this up to wear over more professional dresses, but it also would be cute with casual tops and jeans. This is a true bright white. I'm 5'5"" and 125-135 and picked up the smallest size and the fit was perfect. It isn't super high quality but appropriate quality for this price point, so I have no complaints on that front. It is very lightweight so perfect for warmer spring days or summer days but I wouldn't wear it expecting any kind of warmth. I wash/dry it normally and it will wrinkle easily that way so make sure to pull and hang it promptly."
4.0,Very cute and fun socks.
4.0,"Sheer, but very nice with leggings and a cami."
4.0,"if wearing as non-beach cover up, must wear something underneath"
4.0,Really hard-leather. Doesn't change shape as most leather belts do over time.
4.0,Nice little watch. Keeps time well. And it's cheap. If you have a job where you tear up watches all the time this is a great watch to buy.
4.0,"Very nice material.  More flowing than I thought it would be, which is good.  Bought it to wear at the beach restaurants in Hawaii.  Will fit the bill very nicely!!  I'm a 36C, normally wear a medium in women's sizes.  Don't know if anyone a lot larger (Extra large or larger) would be comfortable in this."
4.0,I have another pouch but it has a valco closure and doesn’t always stay closed if I put everything I want in it.  I like the zippers to keep everything in place. I noticed I can wear it around my waist is I let out the cord enough.
4.0,I like the style of the earrings but they are tad bit too long for my taste.  I will keep them and give them a try anyway.
4.0,"Just a little shorter than I thought it would be.  Especially in the back, making it hard to bend over even a little!"
4.0,"Comfortable, fits well, drapes nicely.  Haven't washed it yet, but if it holds up in the wash I will be very satisfied."
4.0,"I received this set as a gift. The material is quality. I love the red contrast stitching on the blue thermal top. The pants have beautifully stitched red snowflakes. The cut of the pants aren't the best for my waist. They cup my stomach and pull forward so that my rear shows. I'm keeping them. If they were not pj pants, I would need to return. I'm 5'7'' and weigh 175 lbs for reference."
4.0,Super cute. I'm a size 6 and it's fine on me. Could be a little wider across the chest but other than that fits great. If it had pockets it would be perfect
4.0,"I want to give this a 3.5 star. You get BASICALLY what is in the picture, but be aware that almost half of the charms in the package will be the super flimsy 'stamped out' butterflies made of a single sheet of metal which is shown in rows 7 and 8 in the photo. The rest will be basically what is shown in the photo (and only about as many as are shown), but the 'good' charms with actual enamel are roughly only about half of what you get. I got most of the colors shown but not all of them, overall relatively happy. Did not bother to count to see if there was really 128."
4.0,"Nice shirt for the price, the printing quality could be a little bit better but I’m overall really happy with it ☘️"
4.0,I gave this bracelet as a gift. I liked the unique attachments  related to mar y poppins that were on.
4.0,"Arch somewhat steep, putting pressure on toes, but overall fun shoe and received compliments day 1."
4.0,Received today and it is ALMOST perfect. My daughter loves the cotton feel and hates the adjustable straps so this was perfect. it is beautiful in person as well. I followed the sizing chart and although I was curious about the size (xxl) for my slender 11-year-old I know sometimes clothing produced in other countries is sized differently.  I was wrong. I returned the item and would have loved to get a smaller size- a large- but that size is not available.
4.0,"not made for covid protection :) just an FYI . But it does keep you safe from sun and dust when doing outdoor activities. Super breathable and comfortable except it was a bit snug on me but I just have a larger head lol designs are good and is machine washable,cold water and  delicate setting. I would hang dry. Very comfortable on ears to ."
4.0,These shirts are great if your long of arm & not so large in chest. But medium tall works best for me
4.0,Got the shirt and loved it. Nice and comfy material that is perfect for the summer. I also bought a junior Tee that is large and they both fit me well.
4.0,Seam is  crooked if patches are on elbows.
4.0,"Nice, comfy sweater. Fits a bit roomy, which can be good to cameflage any bloating..."
4.0,"This shirt fits true to size. It came wrinkled, so it would need a steamer to bring it to tip top look. The crocheted front detail over the material makes this shirt stand out and is very stylish. The shirt is soft and very comfortable to wear. It's good for casual Friday, in and outdoor activities. I recommend it."
4.0,"I wear these rings pretty much everyday and I love them! A couple of them have turned my finger a very faint green, but other than that they are amazing :) definitely recommend buying these!!"
4.0,It is what I was looking for.  I was just trying to replace one that was slightly thicker.
4.0,"Only gave it 4 stars because grey color isn't the same as the picture, its lighter. Ill probably end up returning it for a refund since it doesn't really match my silver or black watch faces that I needed it for. BUT Swiss Reimagined Crocodile leather bands are the best quality for the price. I have the 24mm in white and black color. The buckles are well made and have a nice glossy finish. The blue underside cannot be seen at all while wearing."
4.0,"Reasonable price… love the color combinations ,just as advertised….<br />No regrets , one of the must have dupatta’s in ur closet….If u love wearing traditional Indian dresses"
4.0,"Beautiful stones on the earing and necklace, but the choker itself is a bit cheap and constricting... if you remove the stone from the choker and place it on an 18&#34; necklace it works much better in my opinion...<br />Also, the stones are much more of a turquoise color, but really pretty."
4.0,it is one size fits all so it is as expected.
4.0,"Cute slouchy top.  Just take your measurements before you buy, it runs a bit small"
4.0,"Love this dress, it's a bit short on me and I am very short. But I still wear it."
4.0,"Cute and comfortable, lots of compliments. Looks great with knee high boots for going out or leggings for more coverage like family gatherings. It is a thinner material, so not the most practical for cold winter in Michigan, but definitely worth it for something cute to wear to a holiday function. The fit is a little on the loose side, I used a silk ribbon to accentuate waist."
4.0,"The dress fits, but colors are not true to photo on website. Colors are more intense than expected."
4.0,"Fits like a body con so it really sticks to your body features, but lots of wiggle room because it has no zipper it’s more like a slip on skirt, doesn’t fit perfect but it’s spacious and it’s a really good dupe for the original, looks very similar but it does have a swimsuit type of material."
4.0,Wish I could have gotten a size smaller
4.0,Ringle
4.0,"Good for running. I am finding it a tad tighter, I am average built, 5'2&#34;, size 6. But it stretches nicely and may be I will update my review after a few weeks of using it regularly. So, far its only a week old and is okay."
4.0,They are thinner than I expected but are still nice.
4.0,I would order size up.
4.0,I love these earrings! But I lost 1 the first day I wore them:(<br />They have a great snap on backing but it wasn’t secure enough.  Make sure there tight! Buying again to replace the lost one.
4.0,Nice basket shoe
4.0,"Ordered blue tie-dye. Just blue, pattern not visable."
4.0,"Ordered my hat on August 16, delivered on September 20.  Excellent hat for the money."
4.0,I would have to agree with other reviews in that the waistband elastic is a little tight.  The pants are cute (and quite loose everywhere else).  Because I have chronic pain I need to have looser pants.  So I’m probably going to remove the elastic and just use the drawstring.
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and 140lbs. I wear a size 6. I bought a large and very thankful I did. A medium would be too small. This is a cover up piece - not an actual outfit. Therefore, you CAN see through the white part. Not a big deal if it's just a bathing suit underneath. Material is not high end. Definitely do not put in the dryer."
4.0,"They are better than what I had, but they don't stay on very well."
4.0,"Out of the bag, I was worried. The material didn’t feel good, it was extremely wrinkled, and the zipper kept getting caught. I panicked and immediately went to look for another dress to wear to a semi- formal, out of state, wedding. I decided to try it on with shoes and accessories, and it grew on me. I felt a little self conscious about how low cut the front is (especially while dancing), but I didn’t have a nip slip because I wore boob tape. The polyester material made me feel very hot and sweaty, so if you run hot, keep that in mind. It didn’t matter how many times I ironed this dress, it wrinkles, so be aware of that. Overall, I do recommend, but it’s not my favorite."
4.0,"I am a plus size, 2X, so the chokers were tight. I had to buy extra chaining at the craft store, but they are all cute."
4.0,This is very cute and fit perfectly on my 15yo daughters small physique but the bust area was way too large and looked ridiculous since it's molded for breasts that people that size don't normally have.
4.0,Very cute!! Great fabric also.
4.0,"This leotard was perfect for my 5yo! The skirt seemed big, but she did not need it. I like that it is lined as well."
4.0,This dress is a nice style but it just did not flatter me at all. The fit was great it just looked slightly frumpy on me.  I can’t say anything bad about it… It just was not a great look on me.
4.0,Bottoms are high waisted on me and top is somewhat small. I ordered a medium to accommodate my breast which had lots of clevage (not a big deal) but the bottoms were a little baggy I’m 140 & 5’7” 36C size 7 pants
4.0,"This is a super cute super comfortable super warm little fleece Stitch hoodie. The only reason I gave you four stars was because I've had it now for a month and I wash my jacket at the end of every week and by the third wash stitches tail came off so I had to sew it back on that was the only reason I gave it four stars. I am 5 foot 3, I weigh 209 and I'm a 42D bust and I got an extra large and it fits great. So if you are a curvy or bigger girl this is going to fit on you wonderfully if you get an extra large."
4.0,Very trendy looking. Be careful pulling on the lace bottom trim. It can rip easily.
4.0,"I ordered the light blue hat, but it is more of a grey blue than the pretty light blue depicted. It estimated up to 6 weeks for shipping but arrived in two weeks. The hat was slightly crushed when it arrived but I was able to reshape it without noticeable dents. The brim is soft, but I expected that from other reviews. It fits perfectly and I wear a 7 3/8 in fitted hats. I might buy it in another color."
4.0,Very well made but smaller than I would have liked it to have been.
4.0,But they are a little long. I wouldnt say theyre bad or good. Just a pair of undies.
4.0,A little flimsy but easily fixed.
4.0,"I love the colors I got and the fact that they are very soft inside. They are easy to use, and spacious enough for all my different sizes of sunglasses, without being bulky either. Only reason I’m removing one star is due to the fact that they are not crush proof… but I was aware of that before ordering so I’m still very happy with them!"
4.0,Leather cracked quickly after a couple wears and periodically releases itself from the watch.
4.0,"I don't have any issues with them slipping; however, they are just a pinch on the small side. I spend almost all day on my feet working woth my students and I love to wear Bobs by Skechers at work, so these are so perfect and cute if I need to take my shoes off. BUT, after one day pf continuous wear, the lace near my toes starts to tear because they are a tad too small. It's just a funky fit. I'll keep trying other brands and hopefully find one that fits well."
4.0,I like it but way over sized!!! I gave it away
4.0,Small. Barely fit my head. Good quality.
4.0,Super cute dress!! Fabric feel soft but durable. Wish it was a tab bit long but I am 5’8” and ordered the large. Might have been able to fit a xl and have a bit more length as I am a true size 14.
4.0,Nice glasses. I have the pink.lens pair as well
4.0,Great scarf. Actually pretty good quality for the price. Thank you!
4.0,I bought this and another color to wear at work. The blue one (?Ciel) matches my scrubs. They like keeping it cold in the hospital and nursing home.
4.0,"It’s ok just too tiny it fits like a 2, I’m a 4, it’s more like an extra small"
4.0,Warm jacket great for hunting in the winter<br />Get a size larger
4.0,"The robe is very comfortable and the perfect length. I actually really love it. My only complaint is that it is huge!!! I should’ve looked for a child size robe. I’m 5’2”, athletic build and it nearly fits my 5’10” boyfriend with an athletic build. It’s a small!!! Other than that, I absolutely love it. Comfy, warm, great length."
4.0,"It made me rate this item as a toy, but clearly it isn't, which is why I gave it the stars that I did. Overall, I really like this necklace. It matches a lot of thing because it's so simple. The pendant is a little smaller than I expected, but that's just fine. The quality isn't the best because of how inexpensive the piece was, but it was well worth the money I spent. I'd say if you're interested at all, go ahead and purchase it!"
4.0,"I bought these to outfit my lanyards with a safety breakaway after a couple of close calls with a voracious robot. These do deliver. They don't breakaway as easily as I would prefer, but given that these are made for dog collars, it makes sense that they would take a little bit of tension before breaking away. It is much better than a lack of breakaways certainly."
4.0,"Nice shirt, but the arms run a bit small... not length-wise , but around.  It is pretty tight in the arms.  I am 6'5&#34; 195 lbs.  I ordered a large, which usually fits me in most things.  I'll be exchanging the shirt for a XL."
4.0,"Good shoes, I an enjoying them,"
4.0,Bought for a gift. She was very happy with them!
4.0,Love it the weight surprise me good quailty for your money
4.0,Cute design and fit good. I like them.
4.0,"Love the way these boots look.  I got a half size larger as many reviewers had suggested; however, they're a tad too large.  I think my size would have fit me just right.  They're still wearable, though.  The weather's not right yet for wearing them outside, so I've just worn them around the house for now.  It's too soon to tell how comfortable they'll be with extended wear.  There's not a lot of arch support, so I'm only giving them 4 stars.  But, I can tell they're going to be nice and cozy warm, and I'm looking forward to wearing them!"
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it, but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. It's a hooded t-shirt, not a sweater or sweatshirt type hoodie. Cute graphics made of a thick vinyl and the material of the shirt is a thicker version of what polyester (kids) pj's are made of. Size wise, size up. My daughter wears an adult M in most clothing and I bought her an XL because she likes her hoodies slouchy and long. The shirt is long, but it's a narrow cut, and probably fits more like a Large."
4.0,"I love this top.  Is a very soft cotton and goes good with jeans or dressy pants.  I use this blouse for my mother's memorial mass with a pair of black pants, I looked very pretty.  It's a little bit too loose, so if you're buying take one size smaller.  I recommend this blouse.👍"
4.0,This item(s) was really nice the brooches don't look super cheap they are pretty details are nice and it made a lovely gift apart of a basket I put together. When I got the package the clear packaging that the jewelry was in got ripped so 2 pieces was outside the pack. Other than that I really like the brooches I got large sizes.
4.0,I thought it would be fuller skirt.
4.0,"This is really nice looking and doesn't look fake at all, BUT be warned it is quite heavy."
4.0,Love it ! very warm and cute on my daughter!
4.0,This dress fits great. Great cut. The material on the chest is a bit see through but not terrible. The material is a bit cheap..I wish it was cotton.
4.0,"The  size of a small was perfect and fit beautifully, but it was 12 inches too long.  I am 5'8&#34; and still had to cut off 12 inches from the bottom.  But I love this print and get a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,I have a DD’s this shirt made me look pregnant. If your small chested it will look cute on you.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet but color is too yellow for what I am trying to match.
4.0,"I bought this for my husband, he really likes the skeletal piecework.  It would've been nice to have a rubber band for a 'sportier' look."
4.0,I love the bracelet itself but I wasn't impressed with the charm. It looks cheaply made..:(
4.0,"I like the style and feel of these, however, I had to drop a star because of quality. Day 1 I was pulling strings off the first pair and after one wash the seems fell apart, leaving a large hole in the crotch.  I returned them, but plan to buy another set, give them another try."
4.0,"These are cute! I'm a fan of the bright orange against dark blue. The scarf is a nice length, of medium thickness. Not going to do much good for anyone in a 30 F and below state, but for mild Florida winters, this will do fine. The hat is pretty fitted - it's not one of those big, comfy, loose beanies. It's snug, but it'll do when I really need something for the cold. I like the quirky message and the bold color contrast. Cool product."
4.0,"Came in a day early, material is soft and seems to be decent quality.<br />But I’m a decently muscular guy. I usually wear a medium—sometimes a large. But the small was very loose."
4.0,"I love the rings. My boyfriend and I got two to match. I would like it better if the quotation stated trust and protect (singular), rather than trusts and protects (plural)."
4.0,"This is the 2nd one I have ordered, the first one was missing one of the flowers' center piece and the chain broke. I thought I it fixed so I could wear it on my vacation, but when we stop for gas I had to bend over to pick up something and it broke again. I lost the peace pendent a notice the chain had broken in another spot. I ordered another one and this one is awesome! I did check the chain to see if there was any problems and it broke. So I am going to replace it with a braided cord rope. I think the peace symbol is too heavy for the chain."
4.0,"Nice stylish glasses, but very cheaply built. I'm happy with the purchase, but you can find a more solid pair at this price point many other places."
4.0,"Very nice dress ! Nice quality, but it fits me small !<br />I’m 5’2 and 140 lb I order L and it was kind of small from my chest.😐"
4.0,Great hat makes me feel like a true patriot.
4.0,"I love this dress, it is so cute! I was hoping it would be a little bit brighter. But it fits great!"
4.0,"Shorts longer that depicted, more like basketball shorts."
4.0,This product fit snug but with drawstring waistband it gives a good fit.
4.0,"not the best quality, worked for a while. good look, I would recommend occasional use, and not for sports.<br /><br />Edit 6/9: great customer service. After this message I was contacted. They care and will be sending a new band. Will check that out and review again."
4.0,"Slimfit green turtleneck... I am 5'7""... 38DDD - I usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  It fits well.. I sized up because it notes ""fitted"" and I am uncomfortable if my shirts are too tight.  It was a good idea.  I gentle washed and low tumble dried - did great.  Didn't notice any obvious shrinkage.  The sleeves are just right - I don't like it if the sleeves are too short.  The material is soft and comfy.  The turtle is not super tight - but fitted.  The green is a lovely forest green.  The one thing I am disappointed about is there is a large, reflective leaf on the back neck of the shirt.  Yuck.  If I would have known that, I would not have purchased.  It's about 3/4"" and the turtle does NOT cover it.  So right on your the back of neck, a giant reflective leaf.  Eh."
4.0,Great band. Only reason for 4 stars is because color fades quick
4.0,Beautiful tank
4.0,It is beautiful. I bought it as a gift and she has not received it yet. her birthday is next week. I'm sure she will love it..
4.0,"This is a very soft scarf, it nice and big. You can use it I may different ways. I love it."
4.0,This was for my tween daughter.  She loved them. Nice quality shades.
4.0,Very nice pearl necklace for the price.
4.0,"Pros- good quality, reasonably priced<br />Cons- double layered so breathing can get warm and feels a bit harder to breathe when walking or jogging"
4.0,"Very cute.  I will wear as more than a cover up.  I am a size 8 (usually).  I ordered a M.  However, there is not much room for shrinkage.  I will wash in cold and drip dry.  I fear that it will not fit me, if I wash on warm and put, even on LOW, in the dryer.  I like the quality, also."
4.0,I brought this outfit for a wedding but although I got a small it was way to big l usually gets small or extra small depends on the manufacturers  but I like the style and color..
4.0,"These socks are comfortable, and they seem to wear well. Darn Tough is the best brand you can get."
4.0,Thin but super cute.
4.0,Beautiful watch. Not confident with the quality.
4.0,"It's a unique way to wear a soft blanket, however, it's a sizing nightmare. If you don't fall perfectly in their height/weight chart, what do you do? I went with the biggest size because I'm 5'6""/5'7"" and weigh more than 220lbs. Of course, it fit me awkwardly in the length. I'm unsure whether it would have been better to buy the next size down and risk it being too small in the width. Thankfully I'm just wearing it around the house. Have fun trying to figure that out."
4.0,I am not a person that like to look thru keys after keys to find a key to get in to my house so with this  2 key ring I am able to just put the 2 keys I use daily in it and not have to search for what keys is for what this would be great for younger kids or older people that want to keep there keys to a miminal  and could just click them on there belt loop or there purse and have them at there reach when there come home what a life saver there have been for me
4.0,Like it a lot. Very comfortable.
4.0,I purchased for 1 son and had to give to my youngest son because they were so small. Youngest son loved the material.
4.0,"Teva quality and these are going to last a long while. I wear an 11.5 in this brand and 11 for most others. These are comfortable right out of the box and this third pair  is a nice addition to my shoe choices. Great quality in design, comfort and durability. I'm so glad someone recommended Tevas. Definitely satisfied even given some small amount of wear on the toecap of one shoe. No big deal even as a perfectionist, good shoes great quality"
4.0,"Love them, the backings broke on me my first day of wear so I have to get more secure backings...otherwise I love them"
4.0,"This is my first cycling pair of underwear. I am new to cycling and after a few months of riding weekly, I deceided to buy a pair. They are super cute, comfortable and the padding is nice. I am still sore after riding, but it's not as intense since I got the underwear. The only thing I'm not loving is that it adds a LOT of bulk. I'm considering ordering a pair of shorts with padding so I don't have to wear the cycling underwear under a pair or leggings."
4.0,"Adorable.  Super large.  Can’t attest to quality yet as my daughter hasn’t worn them since they’re so big.  Bought for dress up, so it’s okay.  Still saving for her birthday, hoping her feet will grow a little more."
4.0,My wife is really happy on how these fit.
4.0,Great quality but fits smaller than expected. I used the chart on the Amazon website but shirt still was too tight and would have gotten smaller after I washed it.
4.0,This dress is so cute! It is prefect for a lovely summer day which is the purpose of me buying it. You should definitely buy this if you're looking for something light and easy for this season.
4.0,"These work well providing you don't sweat. Once you do, they will slide off. If you find that it's too narrow, you can easily unhook the bra in the front and wear each side individual. This works well with form-fitted clothing."
4.0,It’s large for sure and a wind will swoop it off.  But it’s so cute.  I have other hats of theirs that fit better- this one has no elastic.
4.0,Love it. The only complaint I have is that the design on the back is different than the one shown. It is different colors and different exercises. No big deal though. Great fit and very comfortable.
4.0,"I love this umbrella, but while walking to my car, the handle came off. I was just holding it and the next thing i knew the umbrella was on the ground  and the handle still in my hand. This is so disappointing.<br />I glued it back on and hope that it stays put.  The test will be when its windy and rainy again.<br />Hopefully my money hasn't gone down the drain."
4.0,"I bought 2 of these - I’m only rating a 4 instead of a 5 simply because the polka dot one shrunk in the wash. The other, more tie dyed, as maintained shape and length - and fits very well."
4.0,"Upon receiving my Jesus Christmas stocking looking at it it’s different and that’s what I like,haven’t worn it yet I am you know Christmas, I’m sure I’ll get good reviews from fellow  brothers & sisters at church.nicely done"
4.0,"If you're getting these gloves to garden and toil in the dirt, then these are great. The fit is perfect; I have ridiculously small hands, and these feel good on.<br /><br />If you're getting these to do any kind of rigorous yard work, like pulling out bushes or vines (especially thorny vines), then you will want to look elsewhere for something hardier. These gloves will NOT protect you from thorns.<br /><br />I wore them all day yesterday, pulling out bushes and weeds along my property line that were tangled in the nastiest thorny vines I've ever seen. I needed to put a pair of my husband's work gloves over these to prevent getting stuck.<br /><br />That aside, though, these are really nice regular 'ol gardening gloves, and I would absolutely recommend them if that's what you're planning on using them for. For $12.99 (as of this review), that's a fair price for the quality of these gloves."
4.0,"A little smaller than we expected, but beautiful all the same."
4.0,Love the wallet and the turquoise color. It is bigger than I thought it would be. It is the size of a full sized wallet
4.0,got it to replace my old one seems a little more raised and sloppy than my old one but its a bandanna for old #7 so it not a big deal.
4.0,So pretty and super sparkly! I love how they sit! They only complaint is that they are hard to get in and out.
4.0,"I have a large butt and most leggings are not cut to cover a large backside without also covering my entire stomach too.. these are no exception. Unfortunately, they also tend to slide down throughout the day. I wore one pair two days in a row and the stitching has started to come undone too. The pockets are nice but be aware that any small items will slide down to the V of the pocket by your knees."
4.0,Its pretty but I can see this not lasting long. The will come through the loops is not carefull. The blue with very nice.
4.0,Very comfortable dress!  Was nervous the white would be see through but it does not!  Cute dress and fits pretty well.  I’d get another color.
4.0,"These Natural Antibacterial Super Soft Bamboo Nursing pads are a great size and are good to catching all the milk. The colors are vibrant and do not fade with washing. The side that goes against the skin is soft and not scratchy. They work great for during the day as long as it is not too warm, I noticed that they do not breathe very well when it is super hot out. I have been wearing them over night and I am having to change them out during the middle of the night feeding because of how wet they are. I believe that is just because of how much I am leaking, but they do catch and hold liquid quiet well. When wearing them because they are larger, the sometimes pucker if you are not careful. They do not slip around inside your nursing bras. The Natural Antibacterial Super Soft Bamboo Nursing Pads have good stitching in both the pads. It does not seem like they will be falling apart anytime soon. But I do wash them in a lingerie bag in order to keep track of them and not to loose them in the washing machine or dryer-which I highly recommend doing. These Nursing Pads are contoured which helps them mold to your breast easier and limits the amount of folding and lumps under clothes.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,I’m glad that I read the reviews! I’m normally a size 6 but ordered the Large based on reviews and it fits nicely and still a little snug. I understand that it is meant to be a compression top but I like the feeling of a hug not a squeeze:-).
4.0,Lens are difficult and hard to change out from lens to lens  for my son who is  12 .  He is very good with his hands and can do most of the changes with other different types of glasses but these are hard for him
4.0,"My kid is 5 and she loves the colors and helps with screen time during these times. Fits perfect, lightweight doesnt hurt the noise."
4.0,It's a pretty piece. Seems durable and is a good size. I'm very pleased with it
4.0,"Great deal for the money. Quality is good, not great but better than expected. Colors are hit and miss but that is subjective on your point of view. For example I got a red that looks like a bad 70s accident but I also got a really nice burgundy red that looks sharp. A friend liked some of the colors that I did not so it works out, especially since you get 22. It is a good buy."
4.0,"I love the look of this blouse. It has a velour finish with a fine corduroy striping, and it drapes/hangs just right. It's lightweight but not too lightweight and will work well through spring. The purple (it's really lavender) I ordered is true to the photo - a gorgeous color redolent of spring.<br /><br />I'm knocking a star off because it's advertised as a ""western"" shirt. It appears to have silver snaps - a frequent hallmark of western shirts - but they're buttons. This is a regular button-down shirt - though I suppose the buttons do give it a western look. It fooled me.<br /><br /> The buttonholes are a little tight but will loosen up after a few uses. They're sewn on with plenty of thread, and the shirt comes with an extra button, just in case.<br /><br />For a made-in-China shirt, this is above average in quality and I know I'll get lots of use out of it.  It works as a shirt over a T or tank, or as a button-down. Overall, I'm very pleased."
4.0,"Looks like jade, fits true to size, shipped fast! Not sure if it IS jade. When cleaning, some green coloring rubbed off on the paper towel being used, but did not change color of the actual plug."
4.0,I loved this swim suit. Fit me nicely at the bottom. I got a 2xl and I'm 5'9&#34; 165lbs. Just small chested bottom heavy. The chest part was a little loose you are able to adjust it i just don't have enough boobs to fill it. If I went a size smaller I'd feel the bottom area wouldn't have fit me. I did have to return it because the nude lining inside kept coming out on the bottom left leg area which when I looked at the stitching it was coming out in a spot. :-( I was hoping to wear it on my cruise but must look for another. Good luck.
4.0,The recommendation was for a medium which is what has to be worn many times for the  length. The dress was big and we are returning it for a small. Dress was adorable and the color listed as pink but was more orangish than pink. It is a very pretty color. It is the same as pictured.
4.0,Fit as expected and a great buy for the price. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,are very new and people have come to ask about the meaning and are cute and modern.<br />Are recommended for use in protecting people.
4.0,"The anti glare is at a lower quality, has a bit of a tint to it so the lenses don't seem completely clear. But they do the job ok."
4.0,Very pretty online.. In person diamonds are noticeably fake.. The silver is part is nice.
4.0,"Very pretty tote & well made, but smaller then I thought"
4.0,"Beautiful, just a little snugger than I thought."
4.0,"Purchased XS and still a tad too big on my daughter. A person with a bigger chest would have filled this out better therefore completing the dress at its best. It's cute but it was just too big on her. Shes 5'4 and weights 105lbs. The criss cross design was cool looking and the back was neat and provided enough coverage. The neck has 2 snaps and that was a surprise and well liked though. Overall liked it, daughter just didnt feel like it was the right cut in the chest area with her small front. Great halter, bodycon type dress.  No loose or uneven ends in sight.<br />We purchased this dress at discount in exchange for our  honest review."
4.0,"This robe is nice, thick and warm. It does run a bit large and long. It is a wrap around with a belt so you can adjust the fit a bit. I love  that the belt is stitched to the back of the robe."
4.0,"A little hard to get it working in the beginning, but a solid and good looking alternative to the original."
4.0,It's a bit smaller than expected doesn't look exactly like the picture but I'm satisfied. Its very nice just not great or what I was anticipating
4.0,Great fit and very comfortable! Would reccomend!
4.0,"Quality made keychain but because it's over seas, shipping takes a while.."
4.0,"Good Socks, soft and very wearable, my niece loved them!"
4.0,They stayed in place while she crawled.
4.0,I really like the coverage of the suit. I wear size 12 but ordered a 14 and I am glad I did.  I like that it has an underwire and adjustable straps. I like the look and the high neck but I don’t like that the silver beads rub against your skin. The beads can’t be removed so I haven’t decided if I’m keeping the suit or not.
4.0,So pretty love it
4.0,loved the suite its just that the sizing is too small
4.0,"Works as stated, excellent value !"
4.0,"I bought a 3x cause I am big woman and it is loose on me but that is fine, I don't like hoodies tight.  The looseness give room for any shrinkage from drying if that happens and allows for layering under it.  It is not tight around the neck at all which is good.  I probably could of bought a size smaller but I am good with this."
4.0,Tee shirt is exactly as advertised loved it get lots of compliments on it and it arrived when they said it would
4.0,My son absolutely loved this outfit and wears it for play from time to time. Worth the buy! :)
4.0,It wasn’t exactly the color I thought but it was cute
4.0,"I purchased this pullover sweatshirt as a woman because it is always nice to have a plain sweatshirt for around the house, at the park, hiking, etc. I am generally a small/medium in womens so I got the small in mens expecting it to be a bit big as I like a sweatshirt to be. I would say it fits more like a womens small or a shrunken medium. It is very thick and sturdy. It lasted well through a wash and I look forward to the warmth of it.<br /><br />PRO: thickness. durability. style. value.<br />CON: runs a bit small<br />BOTTOM LINE: recommended.<br /><br />As a fellow Amazon buyer, I know how important it is that reviews are honest and I always spend time using a product before reviewing it. I know how reviews help me feel like I'm spending my money intelligently so I hope the information provided will help you to make an informed decision. I hope this helps! If so, please vote by replying Yes to 'Was this review helpful.’ Thank you!"
4.0,"The wallet is nice. It keeps the cards & money both from falling out. The only reason it lost a star was for the keychain. The keychain broke on the first day I had it. I'm tying to glue it back together now. It's a pretty cheaply made keychain. So, don't be excited for it. The wallet on the other hand, is pretty nice."
4.0,My only issue is one of the earrings came off in the cab on the way to my venue. i t was an easy fix but also why it didn't get 5 stars.
4.0,"It has this nice cool, linen texture and seemed like the perfect lazy summer day dress. I love the pockets and the versatility the real buttons allow--either a dress or an open cover up! The neckline is a little strange and reveals all within if you bend over, so you definitely have to wear an undershirt with this. The sleeves I think make it almost too 90s moo-moo for me, but I'll just get them hemmed."
4.0,This bag completes my travel wardrobe for upcoming trip to Europe. It is well made and provides added security for my belongings.
4.0,fits nicely nice cotton
4.0,"I bought this for the gym.  It works as intended, would buy again!"
4.0,"Nice, mid-season turtle-neck sweater. Rather than &#34;camel&#34;, color is brown (but still looks good). I'm a medium-built XL, but glad I ordered an XXL instead, which fits prefectly."
4.0,I really like the fit and the suit.
4.0,"They were true to size, thick, seem well made. The only thing I didn't like are the visible seems on the buttocks and crotch area. You'd have to use them under a tunic or dress"
4.0,My daughter (11yrs) used these for a gray wolf costume. One of the ears broke but the tail is awesome!
4.0,Nice top - fits good
4.0,Cute top - comfy
4.0,I thought these were a jip at first but I find that lights don't hurt my eyes as much.  Pretty please with the glasses.
4.0,The legs are flared much more than expected which is okay but don’t expect it to have that skinny flare look like the photo.
4.0,"A little skinnier than I thought, but I like it! It is very bright and summery. A real pretty coral color."
4.0,They have good size and weight. The clasp is a bit tricky but have worn the gold pair several times with no issue. Just bought silver gone as well. Hard to find 2” earrings with secure backs.
4.0,a very nice piece to look at and wear
4.0,would recommend for special wear ex: photoshoot.
4.0,Beautiful watch and it looks great on my husband. It’s made really well and fits really comfy. It’s the type of watch that looks good with EVERYTHING. Giving four stars because we had to return the first one! It kept stopping when we removed the watch and night.
4.0,"Kinda cute but feel a bit scratchy. Not bad just for a visual, but try to avoid petting."
4.0,Love Vionic sandals. Have several pairs. These are super cute but the M width is more like wide. Got then for a supportive walking sandal and put over 6 miles on then day 1
4.0,Nice size for a night out with basic items needed. Was able to use this as a crossbody purse
4.0,"Fit well, except they fall off nose pretty easily.  Very clear and good glare reduction"
4.0,I have the gear 2 neo smart watch and the stock band that came with it broke so I needed a replacement.<br /><br />The good: The quality of the mesh itself is good. It is comfortable to wear for long periods of time and I have not had any issues with it.<br /><br />The bad: The clasp seems cheap and is sometimes tough to close.
4.0,I like the quality and fit is pretty accurate. I will definitely be purchasing from here again
4.0,This is a wonderful bra as well as comfortable! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it was a little snug but I believe it will get a little looser after a few times of wearing it.
4.0,"Great product, smaller than expected that’s why the 4 stars, durable key link. I use this for painting as well as wood burning, great quality. Love that the puzzle pieces all match up."
4.0,"Un artículo hermoso pero legítimamente deslumbrante,únicamente sugiero que no se elabore tan grande,deberia hacerse un poco mas pequeño creo LUCIRIA MEJOR.Este artículo lo compré para mi padre SE QUE LE ENCANTARÁ PUES EL PERTENECE A ESE GRADO MASÓNICO,GRACIAS."
4.0,This outfit was a gift for out new daughter. It is adorable! The quality of material is great. I’m hoping come fall that it fits so she can wear it.
4.0,"Very cute, soft shirt made with nice weight fabric. The only problem is I ordered an XL and it was too tight and XL shirts are always  loose on me.  I gave it to my daughter."
4.0,"Over all I really like this dress but the color isn’t quite what I expected and I feel like it’s a bit smaller than expected. I normally wear a size medium, I ordered this in large for a flowy look, it fits how I would expect a true medium to fit.<br />It is long, which I love , I’m 5’10, finding anything long enough for me is always amazing. I don’t like where the waist  falls it’s not a true waist or an empire waist it’s an awkward inbetween.<br />I was hoping that this dress would be my go to summer dress, it won’t be, but I plan to keep it."
4.0,The colors are gorgeous and bold. I like it even though it’s thinner than I expected. But it does have a pocket to insert a filter so it’s good.
4.0,Shorter then expected I'm 5'8.
4.0,"I ordered a size larger than I normally do based on the reviews. When it came it was too large, and way too long. I was able to alter the dress though. I love the dress."
4.0,Very comfortable.  MY husband loved this!
4.0,... but that doesn't matter too much. I love to wear the donut print with pride around town and getting subtle nods from other phanners.
4.0,"The opening is a bit too big, and catches and pinches my inside thighs when I sit down sometimes. It can be quite uncomfortable if it’s not adjusted properly, and it’s a little too long to wear with certain skirts. It does the job though and the price was right."
4.0,They are as advertised.  They do run a little bit small.
4.0,"It's very hard to find this length - these are a good deal and are warm. On me, they're a little bit scratchy."
4.0,very cute for my 5 year old! Decent quality material.
4.0,Loved. I have never been a fan of rompers. I hate having to take off all my clothing to use the bathroom. But for this I will overlook that aspect. I just monitor my liquid intake. HAHA. But I love the fit. I just wish that the arm sleeve was not so long. I rocked it at a birthday party and rec'd so many compliments.
4.0,"I love the mask, I really do. BUT the problem that bothers me, is that in the middle, the time signature is 2/4. NOT 4 and 3/4. 4 and three quarters is not a time signature. The rhythm shows, 1 and 2 and there and, 4 and. At the end, there is an 8th note slurring to a sixteenth note. So the rhythm looks like 4 with the e on the eighth note, and the and. The rhythm if you clap it out sounds like 1 and 2 and 3 and 4-and. I'm a clarinetist, and it annoys me o much when I see a rhythm wrong or a key signature wrong."
4.0,I like it but it is not as fitted as I was expecting. Still a very beautiful dress.
4.0,This dress is very Elegant. I plan to order again in a smaller size due to it being a little past my knees. I am worried since the chest is so small that a Small will be too small.
4.0,"Cute shirt, I was expecting cotton fabric. Good price, good shipping."
4.0,Needed these for use at the gym while in the shower/sauna/whirlpool area.
4.0,It's a perfect size for what I need it for and it seems to be sturdy
4.0,If you have working / boxing knuckles 10-12 will probably not fit. Otherwise they look good.
4.0,"Depending on your eyeglasses it can very tuff to get these installed.  However after a bit of stretching, squeezing and pulling I was able to get both sides on the glasses.  Once they are on they are great.  They do hold the glasses at the right height to catch any dropped food particles."
4.0,Love the night glow!
4.0,It was way cute except the middle piece broke off of the purse. The company is really sweet and is sending me a new one
4.0,Very cute and sexy shoe. My girl loves them but they do run a little large.
4.0,"The earrings are cute as can be and my granddaughter really liked them but when I received them, one of the post was bent. I was able to take a small tool to straighten it so all is well but that was my only complaint"
4.0,"They looked nice enough, but I didn't realize how big of a diameter the hoops would have (perhaps that's my bad). They were too big to look good on a nose. I returned them."
4.0,Seemed to be good quality. Never opened
4.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; and 175 pounds. I usually wear a 12. The XL fit perfectly. I agree that the v-neck is too revealing for the office, but this is easily resolved with a cami/tank underneath. It's slightly longer than I like (the picture is roughly accurate). I usually like something to hit me just above the knee, and this hits just below., it is a very cute, well made dress. The fabric is thick; it's a universally flattering style and for the price, worth a few adjustments in length etc. I'd love a few more of the prints."
4.0,My bf loves this mask. I ordered one for myself but it falls off my face. I think it's too big. If there's a child's size I would reorder
4.0,I was pleased upon receiving this top.  It is very comfortable and light.  Can be worn with a top during winter.  The top arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I would definitely recommend this.
4.0,"I love the mix of colors so that they go with everything. The picture and the actual material were different then what I expected. However, they are still very versatile and comfortable."
4.0,Love this the only thing is the material could have been better
4.0,"Cute shoe. My daughter loves it has a ""high"" heel. only sad thing is, she's lost a few stones."
4.0,I ordered these for my brother and he loves them!!
4.0,Nice product - but thought it would be bigger.
4.0,(I'm writing this on my moms acc) This cosplay is super nice!! Its good quality but its a meh for its price. Her leg warmers are super uncomfortable so I have to wear my own. The fabric has its own texture which isn't the best but its ok. In all it looks SUPER nice and I have a lot of fun in nene! (my tiktok is ruis.heartz atm if you want to check any of my cosplays out/nf!)
4.0,"This is such a great casual summer dress! It has so many positives! It's the perfect dress to throw in suitcase, because of it's ease and versatility. It's also a great dress for just running errands. The material choice gives it some structure and it washes like a dream."
4.0,They work just fine. I bought them for my golden retriever who had a injury on her leg. They help keep the injury covered.
4.0,"I love the Merokeety hoodie top of the PJ lounge wear, it is soft, not clingy and can be worn over jeans or sweats. The bottoms are too short for me, if they were an inch longer I’d feel more comfortable. I washed these on delicate with a warm/cold cycle and lightly dried on low then hung the up and they came out good."
4.0,"I bought this to wear for waiting tables (it fit the dress code requirements) and was dreading having to spend money on something I wasn't excited about wearing. I'm typically a women's size small, but ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'6&#34; and slender, but with slightly broader shoulders than average. It would probably shrink in the dryer, so I'll have to avoid that.  Other than that minor thing, it looks great and came as advertised and on time. I would probably even wear it again!"
4.0,Adds a little flare to the wardrobe.
4.0,The built in light really only lights up the hour<br />Display is clear<br />Is a tad small but just check the chart.
4.0,Bought this shirt and a equivalent Dickies.  $6.00 difference.  The Woolrich cotton is softer to the feel. I would rather have the Woolrich.
4.0,"I've used similar items for years.  This is the only one that hasn't come loose after sitting down for extended periods.  The large strap slide is a little uncomfortable, but you can deal with it."
4.0,"A bit stiff, but it has plenty of card slots and pockets. I like the protective feature though I have not tested it to see if it actually works. It's not leather, but I've destroyed expensive leather wallets. Considering I'll probably do the same with this wallet, the price is much better. It looks like it's leather."
4.0,"I get a lot to f compliments on this top but I personally feel like I look 9 months pregnant. But it's super comfortable and I usually just wear it around the house, or running errands."
4.0,"This is a great purse for the price.  I did have to take one star off as the glitter does fall off quite a bit.  I used this on my wedding day and it was the perfect size for my phone, lip gloss and a few other small items.  If the glitter didn't come off so easily I would love to give it 5 stars!"
4.0,Gorgeous top.  The shipper shipped it very quick too.
4.0,Bought these as a gift.
4.0,"haven't had a chance to wear these yet, but the colors did stay nice and bright after their 1st machine washing."
4.0,"Love the way these look on me. They are a bit tight on the face so hopefully they stretch a bit with use. Light weight, and a nice tint on the lense. They are not polorized, but they deff make a difference from not wearing shades to wearing them on a sunny day."
4.0,"I really like it, just got it today! The sleeves are a tad short and I got a large, but my arms are a little long too lol. It's nice I didn't like that it came in a vacuum bag and made it stiff and wrinkly... but I really do like it!"
4.0,Very comfortable and the quality is really good. The Band feels great on my wrist. It fits on my watch like a glove.
4.0,"This shirt is for my son-in-law, it is a nice shirt, a little light weight for money, but overall nice shirt."
4.0,"This is a great idea and purchase if you go to formal events and have an open back shirt or anything similar. These are very very sticky!! They are sticky enough I know I wouldn't feel unsure if they were going to fall off through the night or event. I did expect them to make my boobs like the picture though lol I know it's unrealistic, but I guess I just thought the outline or the cut-out shape had a way to stick and lift them up a bit. These make my boobs look ok-ish but if I were to be going to an event in a very low cut or sexy dress I wouldn't wear this just because it made me feel like my boobs were even more saggy. I think this is a great buy for someone going out in a tank top and wants to feel super comfertable or something like that. Kinda like wearing a bra without feeling like you are wearing one. Overall I think this is a good product if you have boobs to start with and apply it correctly."
4.0,Little shorter than I expected
4.0,"The shirt is a nice cotton polo similar to what I would expect for a department store like JCP. To me the shirt runs small, I ordered a large and felt that it ran slightly smaller than a usual size large shirt on my spouse. I probably will not be throwing this in the dryer after washing because I love the shirt and don't want it to shrink. I took these pictures of the polo after I removed it from the packaging and steamed it in the dryer with a wet towel to remove the wrinkles. The collar and sleeves are well constructed, The cotton was not thin, but was a nice light summer weight. The yellow color was nice and bright. I had my husband untuck the polo to show how long the shirt runs. If you are a tall and slim guy this shirt will have more than enough length. I can't find any tag in the shirt. I think it was cut out?<br />I received this shirt in exchange for my honest review. I hope that my review and pictures are helpful."
4.0,Very cute. The only issue was the top is a bit too small. Busty women should go up a size.
4.0,"Bought this for our friend as a birthday present cuz of her love of cats. It's absolutely adorable and looks just like the picture. But it's true what so many other reviewers said, the sizing is pretty awful. It fits smaller than you'd think so to get the baggy look like the model in the picture, you're gonna need to size up by two sizes probably. But because I read reviews like a smart person, I already knew this. So I got her a size bigger, and tada. It fit the bitch. She was pleased. And you will be too!<br />Meow."
4.0,"Feels cheap, but durable and comfortable"
4.0,"For young girls, it is a good dress."
4.0,Cute bathing suit but the cups shift all over the place. I had to sew them in place.
4.0,"Were comfy for a 15 mile ride!  New to cycling, but nothing was sore in the crotch area after the ride!  I got a large in these and they fit great, I'm 5'5&#34;, 148lb, and wear a size 6."
4.0,Very good quality and well made.  Seems to run a bit large.  Straps tend to slip
4.0,"Stretchy, and narrower than I expected. But pretty. Has sparkle to it."
4.0,"Love these Coach slip-ons. When I first opened the box, I realized I'd ordered the &#34;wrong&#34; Coach slip-ons. I was wanting the same as I have already. But I do like it now. So will be keeping it.  They actually match up to the pr that I already had and are a little shorter looking at them together.  But the fit is good.  I have a narrow heel and still somewhat narrow vamp, although I can wear a Medium in many shoes now.  But the length was great and the fit good.  I am not a good person to ask a blanket question like how did the width fit? Because I look for reviews stating that a shoe runs more narrow.  It is better for my foot.  I love the rounding of the toes of the Coach slip-ons.  Nothing severe. There is good cushioning in these shoes, but I have problem feet at age 63 so I do add my own support piece that gives my arches more support.  So I add these to all of my slip-ons.  Today I found another pr of Coach slip-ons that are the &#34;CC&#34; in a brownish fabric with touch of red trim.  Love the Coach slip-ons.  Great looking too.  I clean the white trims with 409/soap and water after each wearing which keeps them newer looking."
4.0,I would give these a 5 star review as the performace of the product deserves it. You drawback is you have to wait about a month to get them in the mail
4.0,Love it fit perfectly.
4.0,but its very wrinkle so had to spray starch couple times
4.0,Holds my pants up well.
4.0,"I bought a pair of this earing for a co-worker, it seems to be real pearls<br />and sterling silver as described, the pouch is quite nice also<br /><br />However the photo is misleading, it is much smaller than I anticipated;<br />but then again what else could have I expected for $12.95?"
4.0,if your looking for a championship trophy then look no further....... this belt will do what you want it to do and that is make people want it.... it looks good it fits well (it has velcro instead of snaps) it weights about 3 or 4 pounds great for young organizations to start with...you will feel like a champion. Cole
4.0,Great fun for college boys
4.0,"Very cute well made dress, I am 5'9 160 and the large fit fine but it was very short waisted, better made for someone 5'7"
4.0,I like it runs a little big but it’s fine it’s for the beach
4.0,Its very pretty! I love it!
4.0,"I haven't used it yet but I did try it , on one of my dress and it works .it looks just like the picture looks simple and nice."
4.0,"The quality of the coin pouch on the one I received could have been better looks like it kind of started falling apart and maybe someone tried to go in and fix it by hand lol but even with that I still love it! It's super cute, it's light weight and I can't wait to start using it. Even with the undesirable coin pouch I'd still buy another. Yes, I could send it back and get another but that's okay mine has character!! :-)"
4.0,"I have no waist, and am pretty straight in the midsection. These bottoms are incredibly flattering for that body type. I love them and am not a ruffle type of person. They create curves.<br /><br />I loved the top in the pictures, but am not crazy for it. The ruffle here are a bit much, and the fit is a bit awkward to me. I will play around with it and am sure it will work out.<br /><br />Overall, I am really happy with this bathing suit. Modest, yet sexy."
4.0,"Even when it is a little bit large it fits ok, nothing that an't be handled. so far i love it."
4.0,actually super good quality for a romwe product
4.0,"This sweat suit is very nice, not too thick and not too thin. It fit perfect. I'm a size 8 and ordered a medium. I wore it to my grandkids football game, and it was in the low 60's, and it kept me warm. I took away one star, because the strings on the pants and hood is way too long."
4.0,"A little smaller than I hoped for or thought they were going to be.  However, they are very pretty and look good on.<br />I would recommend but for those who like really big hoops, these arent for you."
4.0,"Love the way the material feels and definitely holds you in. So soft and smooth--and with pockets! These feel better than my lulus! They are on the big side, so I would buy a size smaller. I usually wear a medium and the small fits perfect! Worth the money and I have already bought in two more colors for less than what I would pay for ONE of the more expensive brands! Great value!"
4.0,"Item arrived quickly, runs VERY small in my opinion, but my son loves it!"
4.0,"I like that these are 100% silk as they have a great appearance and style to them.  They are a little thin, and yet I do believe they are a good value for the price."
4.0,What was received was not same style of mask. Received pleated masks not fitted masks.  Will work but not the same as pictured on Amazon
4.0,"It looks great, the color is perfect and the fabric is of good quality for the price. The problem is that is a bit small. I bought it XL which is my size and it fits, just a little bit snug. But in sure I'll fit perfectly into it in 20 days. Overall it's a good buy, just buy it a size larger than ur normal size if you need it right away."
4.0,Great buy fits well but it is a little thin
4.0,I love these socks. I just with they were a little larger. I wear a 8.5 womens shoe and the mens socks fit me a little better as they come up a little higher on the leg.. I will still buy socksmith socks though. So many cute choices and the quality is good.
4.0,"Very comfortable, nice versatile style, different than any other WACH that I’ve owned.  I received two compliments the first time that I wore it.  The display is easy to read, and it has both traditional and modern feel to it.  Great for both work and play."
4.0,The support is there but the padding kept moving so I took them out eventually . Nice stretch in the material also.
4.0,"Got this bag about a week ago. I really like it, and have already gotten compliments on it. I wore it out twice, I’ll say it’s a cute going to dinner/lunch/brunch/drinks with the girls bag but it’s not a good going out bag. It’s pretty big for a clutch so going out with it in crowded areas was annoying due to the bulckyness. The chains are pretty heavy which is good! The feel of it was great! ALOT of space!"
4.0,Magnets hold up good earrings themselves are poor quality wouldn’t order again but I will be keeping them
4.0,"I took the time out of my day to write a detailed review.<br /><br />If you are looking to buy this dress I personally think you should get it. It’s cheap and does the same thing any fancy dress would.<br /><br />It is absolutely beautiful and I would’ve given it 5 stars had it not been seen to have a rip in it where the shear is straight from the package.<br /><br /> I’m 5’2 (short) and 158lbs. I ordered a size medium and the dress fit perfectly. It was very comfortable aside from the shoulders not staying up.<br /><br />The dress was fairly long but I’m short so I actually expected it to be longer. With heels, the dress needed no alterations.<br /><br />As I said before, if you’re looking for a dress and is interested in this one? Get it. I wore it to a ball. It was very beautiful and everyone loved it."
4.0,Perfect for a scare
4.0,[[VIDEOID:924972e3cb1ae431cc9d2e7b4614a6f9]] I saw a lot of reviews that the glue gave out after a while and the elastic came apart from the white part. I've had this for about 2 weeks and haven't experienced this yet.<br />It's super comfy and fits like a glove. I do slip it in and off my wrist so I do expect the elastic to stretch and rip over time. Great replacement if your skin needs air like mine. Haven't experienced any irritation and I do have sensitive skin. That was my biggest concern when looking into other band options.<br />Colors are accurate to the amazon picture
4.0,i love the color of this item. the flower lining is a perfect add on. the only thing i dont like is the sizing. i know its not suppose to be &#34;fitted&#34; but a bit smaller would have been preferred. either way good item.
4.0,Nice cap for price.
4.0,"This necklace is an adjustable length that would fit just about anyone. I have a pretty thick neck and there is still plenty of slack. The clasp is an S style that doesn’t close entirely and it is on the left. It can be hard to put on without looking in the mirror. It has the quality of most costume jewelry but it is heavy, so you’ll know if it falls off. It’s got kind of a punk style to it. Comes in a very nice hard case."
4.0,"Really like these, they are not crazy long in the trunk like most other sweat pants."
4.0,These work very well !!
4.0,Small is accurate size for 4-6. The panels on legs are strategically placed and look great. These are very lightweight-not lined. They are very low cut leggings and wouldn’t be suitable with any sort of muffin top situation 😂
4.0,Dress looks nice and fit well. My daughter really likes it. The only problem is with the lace in the back. It doesn’t lay flat to the body. I had to tack/sew it to her bra to make it look better.  She is 5’6” and wore a size 7 dress.
4.0,"i love these. they arrived with no problems. the silicone is a bit thick. i have 1/2 , aside from the thickness they're great"
4.0,"Very shiny, dainty necklace. Though the chain appears delicate, it seems pretty sturdy. The charms are extremely tiny and I would only recommend this for an adult if they like the look of a very small pendant/charm."
4.0,bought this for my niece and she loved it...
4.0,"Size is much smaller than sizes shown. I normally wear a medium, ordered a large just to make sure bottoms wouldn't be tight, and the bottoms are more the size of a small.<br />While this was an issue, the company is currently sending me a larger pair of bottoms to correct the problem!"
4.0,Cool shirt but collar becomes loose after a few washes
4.0,I really like the added modesty of this skirt/skort. It is cool and comfortable. The downside is the shorts bunch up when walking.
4.0,"Top is stretchable and fits perfectly, very flattering as shown in the picture.<br />Skirt was a little tight on the hips and shorter than expected.<br />Not complaining about it. However I wish I was able to choose a different size for the skirt."
4.0,Love this shirt. My only complaint is I can only wear for the holiday season -- plus only at night this year when it's a little cooler in Florida. Would love to see a short-sleeved shirt for warmer locations!
4.0,"It was a bit tight in the bodice for size 18. Otherwise, wonderful quality."
4.0,A gift to my adult granddaughter.  She likes it but I thought it was a little small for an adult.
4.0,I really like it.<br />It had a small hole inside the right pocket. Also I should've gotten a Meduim instead of a Small. Other than that I love how it looks on me. I will be ordering the Black one in a size Meduim.
4.0,feels a little cheap
4.0,The bracelet is really cute but it broke while trying to put it on so I haven't been able to wear it.
4.0,This worked perfectly for my son’s wedding. Beautiful color!
4.0,You have to make sure you put the medallion or coin in at the correct angle at first. Otherwise it's hard to move once it's inside the holder. Overall a good product.
4.0,Fit is just slightly big
4.0,These arrived with either rat or roach droppings in the package of stopper charms. I had to sanitize before using.
4.0,"Seemed like nice shades, but I returned them due to fit. I should have looked at the measurements more closely though as these run a little big/wide. I don't have a narrow head, but didn't like how much the arms stuck out away from my face and temples. I prefer a much closer wrap around to block extra light. The polarization on the lenses was good and I liked the mirrored blue/green.<br /><br />Back to the Calcutta Steelhead as they are much better fit for me."
4.0,I bought 7 shirts from amazon. And this one was definitely my favorite.
4.0,I would recommend going up a size.  The shirts are a little short as well.
4.0,"Great suit! Very flattering! Loved that it can be worn with or without straps. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it was a little big in the back, but nothing extremely noticeable."
4.0,"Purchased as gifts for my grandsons. They seem well made, and are just the right size for them to pack not only their clothes for a weekend trip but also their DS, books and a game!"
4.0,"The blouse is very pretty. It fit good and it looks just like the picture. Just that it's a little bit transparent, but not that noticeable."
4.0,Very cute and flattering! But a little low cut. Still love it though!
4.0,Flask
4.0,"These underwear are a lifesaver for potty training. They do look big out of the package, but one she tried them on they fit my 2.5 year old perfectly. They don't hold everything, but they can hold a lot. My daughter likes them because they're pretty. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I was shorted one of the 8 I ordered. Overall this is the best option we have found for potty training."
4.0,Runs small and there’s no elasticity so you may want to go up a size. I ordered a large and it’s extremely tight around the boobs and arms. I ordered a large and I’m a 34 D. It’s still really cute
4.0,"I got the gray with pink at the bottom and the colors were MUCH darker than pictured. I understand it might just be my computer monitor settings however I'm still disappointed in the color. With that said, I never have issues with anything showing up in a color different than what I was expecting so it does seem a bit odd. With that said, they are cute, comfortable and flattering so I would still recommend ordering them. I have always liked this brand."
4.0,Looks good on my Coach bags that's trim in gold.  Gotten lots of comments and likes.
4.0,Bought it for my daughter to attend a wedding. We did some minor adjustments cause we bought it slightly bigger to be on the safe side because time was limited. But was satisfied overall
4.0,"The fit is very nice. Fabric is smooth and soft. I usually wear a medium/large. I ordered XL; if I wanted a bit more compression, I'd try a Large next time. Fabric stretches well; guys with large packages will fine these comfortable. Now it remains to be seen how long it lasts in the laundry."
4.0,I like the size of bag ...quality looks decent enough ...it has two sections which makes things easier to be found
4.0,Decent case for the price.  Would pay much more for a name brand and these work exactly the same.
4.0,These are adorable and affordable.  We use them all the time with my daughter.
4.0,"I loved this wallet. It is very thin and much more comfortable than my previous wallets. The clip doesn't hold a lot of cash, but it's enough for me. I only once struggled to get all the bills I had in. The pop up mechanism makes it easier to retrieve your cards that with other slim wallets. However, it is plastic and feels a little cheap. Mine busted after 6 months, but at this price point I don't mind just getting it replaced!"
4.0,Very soft and will come in use. Wrong color group came in but I don't feel like returning it.
4.0,Very nice but a little heavy. The back doesn't want to stay on one of them either.
4.0,I really like the colors and size! They are both very noticeable and lightweight at the same time!
4.0,"Hugitout Women's 14K Gold Plated Layered Pendant Necklace,Cubic Zirconia Double Chain Choker Necklace,Multilayer Necklace Dainty Personalized Jewelry with Gift Box and Greeting Cards<br /><br />This necklace came packaged very well and in a pretty box.  It is a very delicate looking necklace and would look good on anyone.  It has a nice sweet design that will work with almost any outfit.  The only thing I did not like was the chain.  It seemed to get tangled easily which will get annoying after a while.  Because of that, I probably will only be wearing this on occasion and not more frequently due to the chain."
4.0,No me llegaron completas solo venían 6 y eran 12 lentes
4.0,"Most of these are fairly undesirable colors, unless you have an extremely colorful wardrobe and happen to be able to pair these with your outfits. They are a good size and hold up well to frequent wearing."
4.0,Beautiful blouse and material but definitely too big for me. I ordered one size larger as suggested and it was way too big. I gave it to someone as a gift.
4.0,Sorry I didn’t get to snap a pic of the top up close .. but I ordered a small and my boobs were literally falling out. It’s a great swimsuit with a good material. I literal buy things just for reviews to help others to purchase . So if you have a heavy top then you will wanna size up..
4.0,"Quality mask with a solid build, if you need it.  This is three steps above a dollar store mask, in terms of quality.  But in my case, it's a lot to pay for a mask that will only be used once."
4.0,"Loved the shirt, made well. The only complaint is that it's a little short"
4.0,"This is REALLY small. We ordered a large when my girlfriend normally sits between a medium and a large. I would say go up 2 sizes if you are between because it's just super small. We got it on with some work and it looks great, but it was hard to get it on in the first place.<br /><br />Once on it did a great job of slimming and even felt nice to her. She didn't feel like she was sweating and was able to walk around the house with ease. It fits nicely right underneath the bra area so you can really enjoy the way that it feels. Overall it's a great little trainer.<br /><br />I received this item in exchange for a fair and HONEST review."
4.0,Fits my husband who has a fairly large head. Looks and feels nice.
4.0,"Nice bead, it was a gift for my wife. She loved it."
4.0,I thought the size chart was slightly off. I measured and waist size called for xlarge.  Usually I wear large. The shorts fit and are roomy. That’s good for movement. Large would have been OK as well.<br />Shorts arrived super fast!! Thanks.
4.0,It’s a cute dress!
4.0,I like these.  They are just much smaller than I expected
4.0,Luce these glassses the only thing that I didn’t like was the mirrors are too translucid
4.0,Perfect gift for my sons teacher and class aid!
4.0,"Can't beat the price, but obviously not high quality. It was good enough for what I paid."
4.0,So far so good! Have only had it one week but for the price and if it stays in good shape I will be purchasing more!
4.0,Very cute!!! I did have to buy 2 bathing suits because I needed a large top and medium bottom. So I do wish I could have selected those sizes. But I do love the bathing suit.
4.0,Not sure why anypne needs two of these - waste of materials.
4.0,Have used these when riding on our bikes and they provide nice glare and wind protection. The frame is a little less sturdy than I like but overall they work well.
4.0,it was a good deal the color and the size was perfect as i order
4.0,This is great for the Fall time or winter with leggings.  the material is a little thick for a summer time wear.
4.0,"I love the message on this rock, but the one I received had a defect on the front. They included a card explaining that any defects are part of the authenticity of the rock, but I don't understand why they didn't just write on the other side."
4.0,This dress is beautiful but was kinda bit big from what I ordered. Make sure you get a size smaller the material is very good that it stretches. Good quality material.
4.0,"Great lol. Decent quality. Buttons for hood are a little too loose, tho. Which was the reason for 4 stars instead 5 stars."
4.0,The dress was great for price.  Did run a bit small. Material was nice.
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my teenage niece, she liked it but then purple is her favorite color."
4.0,Beautiful shirt. It was just a bit smaller than expected
4.0,"Love the material, fits great. Only problem is the waist doesn't stay up."
4.0,More Pepto pink than pale ballet pink
4.0,"I like these a lot. They're comfortable.  Only complaint is the product said it has pockets, but it's maybe a half inch deep and like an inch long. Thats not a pocket."
4.0,This is very cute the only thing I didn't really like was it seems like the black was a little faded so it was more of a charcoal. But it's well-made and comfortable
4.0,perfect coverup. thin & quick drying material. really cute. definitely a little short. I am usually a small and I ordered a medium and it fit perfect
4.0,My niece will love this.
4.0,So cute & got lots of compliments. It's a great buy because it's so unique & pretty. It's fit is adjustable for all to wear. Only flaw is the edging isn't smooth & the interior tan color shows too much.
4.0,"Very pretty earrings!  So pretty and shiny!  I love the silver color.!  The silver is beautiful, and they feel great in my ears.  These really sparkle in the light!  Simple, classic and stunning.  Just exactly what I wanted.  And made in the USA makes them even prettier somehow.  Nice pair, would make a great gift!  Just love the look!  Not much else I can say about them other than they are quality made in the USA, pretty and just a great pair of earrings!<br /><br />I was given a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I was not paid in any way and all opinions are my own."
4.0,Style n color
4.0,"Slightly loose, but cute. Material is thin."
4.0,"After a few minutes of wear, the front starts to weigh down, and I had to continuously pull it back up. I am a size 36B. Great material, and great design though."
4.0,"I already have this top in another color and ordered the size I normally ""buy."" For some reason, when I came back to reorder this top in a different color, I used the manufacturer's size listing and ordered one size down thinking it would fit because those measurements surely were within my size. Nope! This ""one size down"" top is dramatically smaller than the other top I had ordered and it does not fit my comfortably. Order the size that you would normally wear/buy-do not go buy the product page manufacturer's size listing."
4.0,My daughter loved them but they don't last long.
4.0,"Bought this to wear to a Chris Stapleton concert. Good quality, cute tank. I’m only 5’2” so it was pretty long on me. Wish there was an option for petite sizes."
4.0,Runs small. Great price and fit.
4.0,Love the dress. The sleeves are short.
4.0,Pretty much exactly as they appear. Arrived a little bent but not much and they bent right back.
4.0,"Reasonably comfortable, seem to be well built. These are listed as size 10-11. I'm a 10.5, closer to 10.0 than 11.0 and my heels come right to the end. No way these would fit a size 11 wearer. They advertise that they're good for wide feet, which I have. They're pretty snug. I had a similar pair in another brand. Same issue, but they stretched a bit after a few wearings. I'm keeping these hoping they too stretch a bit. As for my rating on arch support, I don't think slippers are intended to provide good arch support. They are well padded inside."
4.0,this is an amazing costume but they didn’t give me the bow for my hair. i tried to message the seller but there was no way to. just be careful with this. with paying the price you would think they would include all the pieces.
4.0,"Very comfortable, flattering and loads of compliments.  Material is like a slightly thin, silky swimsuit. Flows nicely.  I am 5'6&#34; and it hit the top of my feet.  Good coverage or cleavage...the wrap stays nicely over the chest or under braline.  One star deducted because belt loops were not sewn flat and belt width was a tad thin.  Belt is not sewn in place.  I am a normal 10 to 12 with 36DDD and ordered a large."
4.0,These swim shoes worked great for my daughter and myself when we had a trip to the water park. Will purchase again. They held up well in and out of the water.
4.0,Fit my kid pretty good and super cute. Smelled like freshly cleaned laundry too!
4.0,"When I first got the dress, I was skeptical about how it would feel on as the fabric felt cheap and almost plastic. After a good wash though, the fabric felt much better. It's still thin but it's a summer dress so I can't complain. It fits around my waist loosely which is exactly what I wanted! It's turned into a great work dress."
4.0,"When first time I tried, it didn't fit and was about to return the product then I realized there is an extra piece on the button side of the watch that I need to remove also before this wristband would fit. Took me a while to figure it out but overall its a good fit for the Garmin Approach X40 once you figured out how to remove the extra piece thus the 4-star instead of 5"
4.0,"I love the design on the shirt. Fit a little smaller than I had hoped, but all in all a decent t-shirt!"
4.0,"Legs are really long, expected a fluffy soft material but it's more of a thin firm material."
4.0,"The color and fit were good. A little too big for me, but, I am between sizes and went to the XL to be safe.  Good price for what you get.  Fabric is a little thin and may not hold up for very many washes.  But, it looks nice on. I will, more than likely, order more in the future.  Oh, and, took a LONG time to deliver.  So, be prepared."
4.0,I love these pants. The fit is great--except too small in the waist. Ordering the next larger size. UPDATE: Larger size fits great in waste and hip. A looser pants-like fit in the legs--not leggings. I like them.them and
4.0,"I bought a 9. Even though I don't wear socks with these, they scrunch my toes together. Caused blister on little toe (I never get blisters), bleeding when toenail rubbed on neighboring toe (this has never happened to me in 40 years of running). Souls seem hard. Good-looking, and might still be good for work. Exercise? No, because they are too small."
4.0,"I really like the band. It’s nicer in person. Fits my very small wrist well. My only issue is the loop slides and band sticks out, but it’s not a big deal.<br />I get a ton of compliments on this band."
4.0,These really work well!  My only complaint is that they are ridiculously long. I dont need them on my back!.
4.0,"I am not big on expensive jewelry so I got these. I like the hand made look of them. Though the jewels look cheap, I don't mind. It's just for fun."
4.0,Great stylish watch for the price. Looks classy in any attire!
4.0,Wear it everyday - love it
4.0,"These earrings are really pretty, but disappointed at how small they are. They are also very thin with not much weight to them. I would have preferred a heavier earring. The pictures made them look bigger than what they actually were. They did include the measurements so it's partly my fault for not taking more notice. They are very pretty though."
4.0,Great value a I got a bigger size just to make sure. It was a little big for my daughter but it's better big than small.<br />Nice color too.
4.0,"I liked the fit, but the perfume fabric softener was strong"
4.0,Very cute shirt. Is more silky than cottony. Runs kind of small. I wear an XL and it was kind of tight.
4.0,"These are comfortable and pretty good for the price. I don't like how the shoe material looks a bit cheap though, but overall the shoe is well made. I ordered the grey ones."
4.0,Bought it for my daughter..but the quality looks to be excellent.
4.0,"Maybe it's bc I've always used regular barbells, but the flat heart (although very cute) was kinda irritating. Felt weird on my tongue and when I ate, food would go under it and it wasn't comfy. I'd probably only wear this if I was going out + wanted to look cute, knew I wasn't gonna be eating and wouldn't have it in for long. 4 stars bc my experience wasn't the best but it's well made, very cute, and other ppl might not have the issues I did."
4.0,"Wasn't what I expected - But I liked it better!<br />Was smaller than I was thinking it would be, that was ok because it didn't look cheap.<br />Very Happy with it!"
4.0,It arrived quicker than expected.  My teen is a fan.  Only complaint is that it is a cropped sweater.
4.0,"This a cute dress, its a good stretchy material, I wish I could wear it but unfortunately it runs a bit small."
4.0,Nice product. Wider than croakie little comfortable because of it. Hope it lasts longer than croakie before it comes apart.
4.0,Good quality<br />I am using computer more than 8 hours per day befor wear the glass having every day headache and blurred vision when my eyes tired but now more I feel comfortable with it no more headache and protect my eyes.
4.0,Veri confi and soft
4.0,"I bought these for my nieces to be the flower girls in my wedding. I found these dress and thought they were absolutely adorable.<br />They shipped pretty fast and didn't come in damaged. I would go a size up though. I originally had ordered a 2 and 6 for the girls, they what they wear now, the 2 was too tight and the 4 was too short on the bottom. So I had to return (which they made very easy) them and order one size up for both of them. They fit almost perfect now. Had to get the size 4 hemmed for the younger one which I had expected. Only downside is the sash and the flower are not a part of the dress. You have to put that on yourself. I would of like if it was attached as shown so I didn't have to get it sewed on myself. Overall pleased though, and I can't wait to see them in it on the big day!"
4.0,"My daughter is short, so this needed alteration. (she did not want the &#34;train&#34; effect)  It was fairly easy to shorten.  She received many compliments."
4.0,"Optometrist kept having to adjust metal frames and sometimes the adjustments were uncomfortable.  This gave me the adjustment and fine tuning by where I placed them on the legs, and how to make glasses tighter without having to go to optometrist to adjust"
4.0,"These are definitely capris (I was confused after reading other reviewers comments on them being pants). The heather green is a great green/grey and are neutral yet different at the same time. The waist is high without being a true &#34;high waist&#34;. The calves were maybe a bit snug, so they may not be good for women to have very large calves. Great fabric. For me, definitely worth the $."
4.0,"Comfy little sweatshirt to wear on colder days before winter hits. I like that it is a bit lighter than most of my sweatshirts so it doesn't get too hot. The pockets are a nice idea, but a bit too shallow to fit my phone in  them without it falling out if I move. Sleeve length is great, and overall length is good too. I only took a star off for the pocket size, but otherwise I wear this frequently. I have the ""khaki"" color which is really a wine pink color and looks very nice. Just like the picture. Washed it several times now and no color bleeding or shrinking. The inside is not fleece, so it sits nice and flat without pilling or getting fluff all over the rest of the laundry."
4.0,Very pleased with product and timely delivery. Good experience
4.0,Looks and wears good.
4.0,Choker Coker yes choker<br />Lovely!
4.0,"I like this, it is adorable. It came in a Disney package that was sealed. But, the tail had some debris in it--kinda gross. Once I cleaned it up the ears and tail were so cute!"
4.0,"Really cute suit. The top fit well (I'm a B/C cup & got the XL), but bottoms were tiny! I kept it because it was worth the price just for the top."
4.0,HUGE scarf! Pretty but more yellow in it than I thought.
4.0,So soft and fit as expected
4.0,worked with my necklace to make it the right length
4.0,"I had to cut the slip to make it look right.<br /> Are usually wear a small, but after looking at the size chart I ordered a large first and the top was huge. So I ordered a medium and it fit completely differently. They are not consistently made.  The large had a true waist line and the medium had an empire waist line.<br />I had to cut the slip to make it look right.<br />They is no lining behind the waist but a white undershirt looks great.<br />Skirt and slip are very sheer.<br />Dress will need to be ironed before wearing the first time. It's not machine washable.<br />Loved the dress for my pictures!"
4.0,It was a gift for my father in law. The conventional masks really don't work for him he wears hearing aids and glasses. He said is good
4.0,They fit perfect and are so soft inside! The material is great and will keep you warm for the winter!
4.0,"Nice gloves, warm and pretty, but a little snug."
4.0,I guess we’ll grow into them
4.0,It stated that it was long sleeve; but was cut off at the elbows.
4.0,"a gift for grandson; it's hard to judge what size he will be in for his birthday,  Size large 14-16 is a little tight so went with the x-large 18-20 which seems a little big.  Oh well, he'll grow into it."
4.0,"Cute and comfortably soft pajamas. The little ears on the shoulders are a really sweet touch. The jammies are definitely on the larger side.<br /><br />My girl is around 43&#34; tall and 41 pounds, and generally wears a size 6. Many size 6 pajamas are too short in the legs or torso and expose her calves or belly when she sleeps, which bugs her. So I ordered a size up to be safe. The size 8 pants were a good 4 - 5&#34; too long, and the shirt hit around her mid-thighs. We ended up ordering the size 6, and it fits her perfectly - even a bit on the long side.<br /><br />She absolutely loves the pajamas, they are very soft. She will be wearing them for quite some time."
4.0,The pants are well made with straight seams and no loose threads.  My daughter says the are comfortable and she likes the stars.  The stars are raised and slightly rough like they are iron on patches but this does not seem to bother her.  The waist band is elastic and comfortable.  The pants are boxier than leggings but not quite as baggy as sweatpants and do not look sloppy.
4.0,"Its  is a little larger than I expected, but nice."
4.0,Good quality but it ended up being too long. Thought this would fall around knee length but it went to mid-calf.  It fit like a glove everywhere else on my body (I'm 5'5 and 140 lbs).  Material is stretchy.
4.0,Look cute on
4.0,Love it but a little tight.  I wear a 7 1/4 hat.  Had a horrid headache after an hour.  Very nice looking though.
4.0,it is an ok skirt. a little short for me.
4.0,"This is a good, single-color set that fits my 6yo perfectly."
4.0,"Very warm but felt a pit stiff—I mean I could definitely drive in them though & im sure they’d feel more flexible once broken in. Also, they are a bit ugly in person....In my opinion leopard print black one are the most attractive of the ugg adirondacks"
4.0,"Overall nice bibs, some of the blue flowers looked faded but it does what it should."
4.0,"I'll admit. I was a bit skeptical after placing the order. Not because of any particular reason really, just skeptical. The package arrived a couple days ahead of schedule which surprised me a bit. The box the ring comes in is a little less than can be desired but that's more so my fault because of my preconceived expectations. The box serves is purpose just fine. The ring itself is exactly as I ordered it. The birthstones and names are all correct. I would certainly recommend this seller to anyone and will probably purchase others in the future."
4.0,"I couldn't give it 5 stars because I have not had it long enough but I love this. It is so cute. I am 5'8"" 217 and a 38DD. I typically wear a 14 OR AN L/XL. I got an XL and it is actually kind of big. I definitely could have gotten a L. It is not that bad though so I am keeping it! it's nice either way"
4.0,"Simple elegance,"
4.0,"Ordered an XL I'm 5'4&#34; 195 and it fits great. I got it in black and it's very flattering, however, the pockets (while awesome, cause...pockets) are not even on the dress, one is up higher than the other, they are off by like 6 inches. While it's not noticeable to others while I am wearing it,  it's kinda annoying to me. However, I really can't complain too much as I got this dress on special for $9.99, so I will deal."
4.0,"I bought this outfit for an adult pajama party. The material is really thick and it will keep you warm during the winter however, they fit a little large. I should have ordered a size smaller. It was cute and was definitely all eyes were on me."
4.0,Good material but not worth $20.00 a pair.
4.0,"I got this product pretty quickly and found it to be very high quality. However I was expecting some sort of a band that I would keep this thing firmly on the forehead. The fact is that you have to tie this headband to the correct size of your head. The material of the cloth is quick nice and silky and there is a metallic pendant on it that is cool.<br /><br />I have given this product an honest review for a discounted price. Usually the discount is not much and I am not a sellout but am doing it for fun and to help others. Thus I give 5 stars for excellent flawless products that meets all expectations, 4 stars for products that are really good but may need improvements and 3 stars for desperate last minute buys that cannot be avoided and would serve the purpose more or less. Thank you for reading my review and have a great day!"
4.0,"Except for the sharp metal part being exposed its good. They need a plastic guard to cover that, like a hair clipper guard. I used leather. That said, it’s nice to have when you need it."
4.0,Like that they are soft and comfortable.  Helps that they have adjustable ear loops and flexible nose piece.  Very lightweight.
4.0,The hat is very warm and comfortable.
4.0,"At first I thought I wasn't going to like these socks. They have that old acrylic feel to them which I think is kind of scratchy and stiff. I think the design is kind of ugly and I am not a fan of the busy colored styling. I am used to wearing compression hose and socks since having spinal fusion surgery and developing severe DVT in my leg after surgery. I wear a &#34;professional&#34; thigh high hose on my right leg and a knee high compression sock on my right lower leg. I typically wear Sockwell brand knee high compression socks on my right lower leg which I bought on Amazon. I LOVE the Sockwell brand and eventually bought 7 pairs. They are the most comfortable socks (the Sockwell brand) that I have ever worn. Once they are on, I totally forget they are compression socks and they feel heavenly all day long. These Ace socks in my opinion run quite large. I wear a women's size 9 and the pair of Ace socks I received to review were sm/md 5.5-7.5 shoe size. They fit fine, even in the foot length. The socks are huge in comparison to my Sockwell socks and these Ace socks did not feel like they would have the same compression fit and feel. Once on, however, I liked them and they have felt good all day long. They don't feel scratchy at all and they are so snug that it is very difficult for me to pinch the sock off my leg, just like my Sockwell socks. The Ace socks are a bit loose and baggy on my foot though. I still think the Ace socks are ugly and I don't like the large &#34;ACE tm&#34; on the top of the foot by the toes. I think they look tacky. I will stick with my Sockwell compression socks."
4.0,"The glasses are great, they fit my face well. The quality is great for the price point. The only thing I'm not to crazy about is that the lenses do not get dark enough when in the sun. Not to say that the sunglass are not dark, there just not as dark as I would want them to be but they do protect my eyes when I'm outside in the sun and are very comfortable to ear."
4.0,"The hoops are a smaller gauge than most nostril piercings, extremely thin and open ended. It is hard to squeeze the hoops closed enough, and they turn and fall out a lot. You have to mess with them constantly. The studs are cute but very cheaply made. The stones are mostly glued on to the posts kind of haphazardly, crooked and off center, and they fall out of the piercing hole constantly. Posts are short and the stopper ball on the end isn’t big enough to keep them from coming out. Lots of designs for the price but most of them just don’t work well."
4.0,"Helped me organize better when traveling. I was able to pack a lot of clothes into one of the cubes. I loved everything about it, but I gave it four stars because the strings attached to the zippers kept coming apart when I would try to zip the cube closed. The zippers still worked fine afterwards, but it was nice to have the extra string to help zip them up."
4.0,Pretty solid item at a very reasonable price!
4.0,Very cute and fits well but you can tell it's not made from the best quality materials just fyi
4.0,Arrived on time. Made of ok quality material. Would highly suggest.
4.0,"The reviews for this dress were ALL OVER THE PLACE. So I’ll try to be precise and straight to the point.<br />Ht: 5’10 ( without heels)<br />Wt: 235lbs<br />Bust: 43in<br />Waist: 36in<br />Hips: 49in<br />Arms: 17in<br /> 3x fit PERFECTLY. Still had about 1/2 inch fabric for wiggle room in the arms & waist area. ( was able to put dress on over head without unzipping. Not cheaply made AT ALL, has side pockets, NO belt hoops, fabric isn’t transparent but still breathable. (Went to a outside wedding in 87% weather with NO shade) mild stretch. WELL WORTH THE PRICE. 🙌🏽."
4.0,"Based on the size chart, I ordered a large and it fit great. I wear a medium in regular clothes. Always rely on the chart"
4.0,"Gloves are comfortable and the leather is nice. Gloves are a little long for a medium, I’m not sure if I wil exchange for a smaller size. These runs a little long. Insulation is good and my hands stay warm."
4.0,"Work perfect, arrived on time good price !"
4.0,Would have given 5 stars but is less protective than I had expected. Other than that it is fine.
4.0,Good quality. I bought this for my son and he loves it.
4.0,"Lenses fit fine. I like the tint and mirrored finish. After a few weeks, I already have a few small scratches in the coating so I don't know how tough they are. My old lenses remained unscratched for a long time."
4.0,"The color and shape were nice and equal, but with a few flaws which were acceptable.  Bought as a gift.  Feel that the seller should provide an earring back for safety."
4.0,I love the quality of this product although the pattern is a little darker than the picture it advertises.
4.0,The fit is perfect i love the fact that it is high waisted I feel the support in my abdominal area.
4.0,Very cute but be careful with the sizes. I'm 5'7 and 170 lbs . Ordered a XL. A little snug.
4.0,Nice Hat<br />Reasonably-priced
4.0,M gusta la pulsera
4.0,"Quality is 'meh', but fine for the price.  Top opening is a little snug nut nothing too bad!"
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous better than I had envisioned. Listen to all the other reviews and order a size up if you are unsure about your waist. I got a large, I'm 5'4 and 142 lbs. The skirt is long and may drag a bit but its part of it elegance. For the price it's an awesome score. Super happy with it bought it for my Halloween costume (I was the moon) and I will wear it in real life too."
4.0,"It fit my daughter great with a little room to grow.  It fits about a size 14/16 girl.  It was sewn poorly, but for the price you really can't beat it."
4.0,"Nice sticker, easy application (apply on outside of window) but a bit smaller than I expected.  Go Wolverines!"
4.0,Great watch. Easy for my husband to use
4.0,You get your money's worth
4.0,"These are just like the bracelets we saw in Mexico.  I bought this to put in an Easter care package for our son in the service. Surprisingly enough, he wears it.  I thought he would just throw it in the car, but he likes it.  That's good enough for me!"
4.0,"I like it but it runs large, should have ordered a size smaller."
4.0,The lines are smeared on the earrings yet i get a lot of complements.
4.0,"These are really cute but my 1 year old has long hair and his hair seems to get stuck on these and pulls. They are really soft but durable feeling, clean off well after using and hook nicely at the neck. Love the colors!"
4.0,"I like the color, and the quick-release pin is worth the $9, but be warned, they run pretty small. I have a 7.5"" or so wrist and I had to move the sliding keeper in between the clasp I installed and the stay-put-keeper cause the tongue was too short to make it. This solution works for me, and the clasp does add a little but it would not work on a larger wrist. If you have a 6.75"" wrist it might be a better fit."
4.0,Great support for ankles. Very comfortable.
4.0,"I'm very happy with this jacket.  It's warm and does a great job retaining heat and keeping the wind out.  I do have two small complaints, though:<br />1.  The zipper is reversed for my men's jacket.  The manufacturer may not know this but in the USA, the zipper is on the right side for men and the left side for women.  However, the picture shown is correct.<br />2.  This is a nice over-flap that covers the main zipper, but the only snaps are at the very bottom and at the neck.  It would be helpful to place a few along the flap so it doesn't open with the wind (which it does)."
4.0,"I give it 4 stars!! It fit loose, but it was just right, unfortunately--<br />I'm a larger size up top (38dd) and it went over just barely!!/:"
4.0,"I was looking for llama socks and chose these because they had fun colors and with a 6 pack I can keep a few and share a few with my llama loving friends, too. My only concern is that they may shrink as they don't have extended sizes. They just fit my size 10 foot so I may need to air dry them."
4.0,Giving 4 stars cuz the color is slightly different than the picture. In reality color is more vivid which I don't desire for this style. Love the fabric and neck cut. I'm 5'10 135lb and purchased small
4.0,Love these out of space babies.  Everyone I work with loves them as well :) thanks for such a wonderful product.
4.0,This was actually a gift to a family member but was told she liked it. She said the large was too tight in the arms.
4.0,"Happy with this unique watch band.  Sizing takes a bit of patience, but only has to be done once.  I have not seen anything else close to the looks of this for a Galaxy watch and really think it's cute.  It is quite comfortable and I have not had any issues with the clasp as some have mentioned.  I use this off and on, but had on my watch more than a week.  Took my watch off to shower and charge, but no problems and very cute band."
4.0,It's not bad for what it is. Not high quality but it is sparkly and fun for a night out.
4.0,"I used this in Guam as my rash guard. I t did a great job. I ordered this color to be easily seen in the water. The color turns to a bright yellow when you get past 25-30 feet.This kept me from rashing from my BCD, and kept me from getting sunburned while on top of the water. It snaggs fairly easily, but for the price, I would not hesitate to purchase another one."
4.0,"Love the color and fit, I was worried about it being small but the L (US-M) fit like a large.<br />Cuts off nice in the back I normally don't like long cardigans"
4.0,Small piece. Worked for what I needed but caution if for a person... its super small
4.0,"Tried them on, but haven't worn and washed them.  Like the fabric, though it is a light fabric. Fit is good."
4.0,"I wasn't expecting it to be as great as it was. Nice casual dress. I had to return it because it was a little small for me, but would recommend it."
4.0,"We ordered 2 of these, one in pink and one in teal. My son has had no issues with the teal one, but I have had issues with the pink pair. Well, one issue just numerous times. When I put on the googles, it will not suction to my face. After looking over the googles, I noticed that the black rubber around the plastic lens had come loose for lack of better words. I was able to fix them, but I had to take the pink plastic piece and rubber lining off, take the lens out and then put it back together myself. I am not sure if it is just a defected pair, but we did not feel it was worth the hassle of returning because it works fine for awhile after I put it all together. We are hoping this is just a minor thing and it does not continue.<br /><br />As for the quality of the googles, they are AWESOME! I love how clear everything is and the wide view you get under water because the googles are so open. We got them on a deal and thankful I snagged 2 pairs!"
4.0,Great on-time delivery and love the product!
4.0,This item is smaller then I thought and the chain is longer then it needs to be. However after getting this item I realized it worked for my own situation.it has a little weight to it and that’s the best park. Live long and prosper
4.0,Perfect way to remember that Always ABOLC
4.0,"Returned. I really liked this dress. It was so cute with the bow. However, I normally wear a medium but ordered a large and that was still a little too snug for my tastes."
4.0,Just wanted a easy to read watch and stylish without a lot of gimicks.
4.0,"UPDATE - got contacted by the seller and they sent me the replacement. I wore the one pair from replacement pack all day and no complains so far. Hope for the best as they look really cute. Maybe the pack that I received was defective, but my order was taken care of<br /><br />Such a big disappointment - me and my mom were wearing those for few hours just to discover it ripped. I had holes on my big toes and first I though that its too small for my foot, however one size supposed to fit all. my mom has a tiny baby feet and she had exactly the same thing - both liners ripped on the seam right on the big toes. I am not sure was this defective, based on other peoples reviews I was expecting better quality. Looks cute but doesn't last a day! waste of money at this point"
4.0,"I bought this knowing it would be very light, I have enough heavy duty ones. I wanted something I could fold up in my pocketbook so if the restaurant, theatre, store became too chilly I would have something to ward off the chill. It's perfect for that or a warm night with a little chill in the air."
4.0,The bracelet is really attractive and works well with my jewelry the only negative thing I have to say is that it's very difficult to open even with the instructions and the  little guitar pick tool they provide.
4.0,"This dress is really I wear a 10/12 and a M/L and got this in a M. It fits really well and is not overly clingy! It is so soft and great as a casual dress. I didn't realize how low the tie portion went but you can loosen/tighten it to whatever you want. It is a perfect summer dress for hanging out, running errands, or even at the beach!"
4.0,This shoes runs about one to two sizes smaller I ordered a size 8. Which fit like a size 6/7.
4.0,"Strap is longer than other brands(ok,you wrote it,i miss it) that packing-nothing special, smells awfull !!!🤢 i will see how long it last because looks pretty sturdy. I love colours... maybe if i wash it and smell goes off i change my review.. so far dissapointed<br />UPDATE: smell is slowly going away, even without washing it, i figured out nice way to put it on even with too long strap, i really like how it fit my gschock! Maybe in the future get another camo colour :)"
4.0,The shoes is very heavy so if you are not used to wearing a wedge heel you may stumble a little as you get used to the weight.
4.0,very cozy and warm. Love the fabric
4.0,I got this for my daughter in a size bigger but it is just right so she will only wear this a cpl months. The sweater in the inside can be removed my daughter likes it like that
4.0,It did not match picture color. U
4.0,"Sturdy bags, they can hold alot. Like the built in pouch. We tend to lose if not attached. Only drawback is the small loop that attaches to handle, could be bigger to get back on caribeaner quicker. I like the bags, would buy again."
4.0,Really comfortable to wear for hours. Maybe size up 1 size so the tie in the front looks realistic. If it’s too tight. You can see that the cross looks fake.
4.0,These are nice shirts. They fit pretty snug though so if you want a looser fit you need to size up.
4.0,"You will have to shorten and tie off the elastic as they arrive very long and melt the ends. Not a big deal especially for the price, but not as simple as just putting on the bag."
4.0,The bathing suit is very flattering.  The open slits are not as large as the model picture shows.<br />I would prefer the top pieces to all be sewn together at the back but it's it a deal breaker.  I'm not very large in the chest and would like a bit more coverage.  Might try to go up a size to compare. But still very pleased
4.0,Works good but doesn't stay clasped all of the time.
4.0,Super cute and stylish! Cheaply made and won't last long. They are more in the $10 price point for quality
4.0,"I bought these for a trip, just wanted a cheap pair in case I lost them in the ocean. These lived up to my expectations, but only lasted about 2 months or so before the lens just fell out. I'd recommend given the price, just depends what you're looking for."
4.0,Gets the job done But will drop down a lot of times once it get used to your face And you will have to keep on pulling it up
4.0,"Great jacket, but the size chart online did not match the product that was delivered.  Returned this one and bought in a smaller size which was perfect."
4.0,"Good product, material is good it’s just the the arms and length of shirt were too long."
4.0,"The cardigan fits to size. It's the perfect length for jeggings, tapered pants, or a slim skirt. The blue color is less navy and more vivid than expected, which was a happy surprise.  I don'the regret the purchase, however, I knew that the synthetic yarn the sweater is made of would make it a two season garment. I'm keeping it new-looking by refreshing it in the fresh air, washing as little as possible, and never putting it in the dryer."
4.0,They're cute and get the job done.  They also arrived quickly.
4.0,"Great cut. Fabric is very thin, may need to hand wash. I'm usually a M this is a L and almost so tight."
4.0,I like this blender easy to use
4.0,"I bought this in a medium navy. It’s dark, lightweight and not see through. What I liked: the back is unique. Long enough in front But…<br />Front seemed shorter in length and I’m not busty so if you’re bigger than a B cup I would size up. I might even order a size up because the fit around the chest to the armpit was tighter. Overall though I still like the shirt."
4.0,Got it for my niece. She absolutely loves it. I thought it was kind of small compared to the photo. As long as she is happy though.
4.0,Beautiful pendant but the necklace is tarnishing. I receive compliments all the time
4.0,For $15 it's a cute bathing suit. I thought it was a one piece but it's two.
4.0,"Cute, stylish, good for everyday wear"
4.0,"Exceptionally warm and wind resistant, especially when worn under a wind/rain shell.  Hood is large enough to accommodate a heavy cap but slides right under the wind shell hood.  icing on the cake is it a tremendous compressibility into its own pocket. I wore it in Alaska and cold wet windy weather and it performed very well."
4.0,Love the dress. The only complaint is that the material pills and fades.( I hang to dry)  The dress itseft is very cute.
4.0,"La tela podría ser mejor, esta tela se estruja. Pero en general queda muy lindo."
4.0,Did not have as much arch support as I expected. Are well made.
4.0,"Really happy with the swimsuit, I got it today tried it on meets my expectations! If you are on the edge of sizes I would select the larger one especially if you have a large chest. I only gave 4stars because I  haven't put it in water yet lol"
4.0,"I suppose it goes without saying, but you get a lot of airflow through the mesh. On those cool mornings and evening it'll be a chilly ride. I do like the looks and the fit of the jacket so I guess Ill keep it in the closet until next summer. My only niff-naw is the Velcro on the gusseted sleeves. Would prefer zippers."
4.0,I absolutely love these rubber watch bands. I wish I knew how to clear the clear one. It picks up a yellow color after a couple of weeks.
4.0,Just did not look good on.
4.0,Cute cardigan. Lightweight and fits slightly smaller than expected.
4.0,"I bought these Xloop sunglasses not because I run triathalons, golf or play baseball/softball. I bought them based on their looks and my experience (a positive experience) with another style of Xloop sunglasses.<br /><br />First of all, I bought the Silver-Blue model and both the blue and silver are a matte or satin finish which makes for glare reduction. I noticed that the glasses are cantered forward a little which allows a little light in from above. However, I soon learned why - I put on a ball cap I wear while working outdoors and found that the cantering allows me to wear my ballcap with the bill very low. It's a nice feature if you play baseball/softball or just wear a ball cap a lot like I do.<br /><br />The lenses are of medium darkness and are slightly mirrored in a rainbow pattern. Like the other pair of Xloop sunglasses I have, these seem reasonably solid and rigid. The hinges of the arms seem sturdy so far with no play and seem tight - no looseness in them. The ends of the arms are covered with rubber or silicone and rest comfortably on the ear - to me at least. I have a small head and these seem just a little big so they're probably going to be right on for the average-size head.<br /><br />They're not Oakleys and they don't carry Oakley prices tags either. I like the look and the price. These sunglasses are a solid four stars."
4.0,But its loud to wear.  It makes consistent noise so wearing it to church is not a good thing LOL
4.0,"It took several weeks to be delivered, (I almost forgot about it completely) but once it arrived, it was in a new package and I received exactly what the picture showed. It has a clip like most necklaces do, so it is challenging to get in on my wrist by myself. Only worn it once so far, but it hasn't broken, yet. You get what you pay for, and I think paying $2 for this bracelet was a deal!"
4.0,I ordered one size bigger because of the reviews I read.<br />They are slightly big but I can wear them. I think I didn't need to order bigger size ....
4.0,"He’s only worn them twice for short intervals, but these fit well and seem to be comfortable and good quality. They are a bit difficult to loosen and get on but otherwise we are very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I bought for mom. She owns some of the ""real ones"" and she loved these! My only concern is cheap looking wire hooks. That bit needs a little help otherwise a good deal!"
4.0,"Adorable but I’ve worn it out quickly. I’m already noticing micro-tears after 8 wears. But, a good deal and loads of compliments."
4.0,Worked well for cousin it costume
4.0,"This shacket is very much on trend. The fabric is medium weight and unlined. I wish it had even a thin lining, as it is itchy if you don't have long sleeves underneath. It's not flannel but something that looks more like rough wool. The plaid is nice. The medium is roomy enough to wear over a heavy sweater."
4.0,Loved this shirt. It fit perfectly.
4.0,Love these glasses. This is second time I bought them. Only drawback is the arms do get very loose and you need to keep tightening.
4.0,"Shirts are extra long, good quality too."
4.0,Very long on me.. I'm 5'0 and it dragged like a wedding dress but a very nice dress
4.0,Came just as said and how it looks. I would purchase again.
4.0,Works for I need it for and when I don't need for a mask any more I will use it for a  Bandana
4.0,Sure am thankful  for these masks. I appreciate them. Thanks again!!
4.0,Light weight not as heavy as expected but looks nice.
4.0,I very much like this dress. Quite comfortable on a hot day.<br /><br />The only issue I have is gapping under the arms which puts ones undergarment on display which is fairly immodest.
4.0,"I’ve tried 3 or4 different masks to try and find something that’s comfortable. It’s a little warm since it wraps around the neck, but it’s better than anything else that I’ve found. I don’t use the ear holes because it pulls the mask up a little too high for me. It stays on my face just fine without the ear holes. I liked it enough I bought 2 more."
4.0,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas, it's still holding up strong and hasn't shown any fail signs yet. It's small then what I was expecting from the pictures."
4.0,"Note: there are 2 different styles available on this listing. I chose to order the longsleeve V-neck with front chest pocket tunic in a solid white..<br /><br />Item runs adequate to U.S. sizing and is made with a rayon mix.. this also has spandex to offer a bit of stretch. This has plenty of length through the sleeves and torso.. and falls lengthwise about top-mid thigh.. material is soft and stitching seems to be on point with no loose threads or, sloppy seams. White is not “see thru” but, it is shadowed!! (allows you to see the outlining/silhouette of under layer.. which is often expected with white T-shirt) So, I do suggest wearing with flesh colored bra- to keep this to a minimum.<br /><br />The cut is a little boxier thru the shoulders but, does sort and figure itself out as it hangs down nicely on the rest of the torso.. if, you don’t want any shrinkage- I would recommend washing on cold and line drying only. The V cut is classic and not overly revealing at all- it frames the perfect when worn at the collarbone!<br /><br />For reference: I’m 5’2”, 154lb, 38C, 40+ yr. old with trouble spot thru the middle (thx to my x4 kids and gravity..) I hope this provides solid info to compare- as, I chose an XL to give and all around through the chest.<br /><br />If looking for a standard tunic for casual wear- this does the job fine. It’s a solid option for the price point.. I hope this info. can help your decision- feel free to let me know!"
4.0,These masks were nice and light. They fit a little tight. I bought them for my 15 year old. Would be a better fit for someone with a smaller head
4.0,Almost too Dark but they are pretty good for the price!
4.0,"This leotard is really cute on. The blue has a bit of shimmer to it as well. I ordered my very average sized 3.5 year old the size 4-5 and it’s a bit small for my liking, and she just started wearing 4T clothes. She keeps tugging it down."
4.0,Cute but the sleeves are rather short. Basically a 3/4 hoodie
4.0,Looked nice and eligant but also simple
4.0,nice idea for a man who has mostly sport tie clips.
4.0,"This suit is very flattering!  The cut of the bottoms is nice and high and the ruching helps hide the tummy area.  The coverage is great in the front and back, as well as on the hips.  The top is a little tricky to get tied tight enough and does not have great support, but I typically prefer comfort over support anyway so I'm satisfied.  This is a fun suit with enough coverage to make me feel comfortable out with my kids at the pool!  The fabric feels durable and the little clear pouch the suit came in will be handy to stow essentials at the beach without them getting wet/sandy!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,I also bought the Buckle Rage Buck Hunter Deer Hunting Buckle and have the same minor complaint - the buckle itself is not that large.  Make it a little bigger and it is an easy 5.  The buckle is well made and works as it should.
4.0,I usually wear a small but THIIISSS fit like an extra small 😬 no stretch at all. But this dress was definitely fly !
4.0,the goddess kit is pretty i love it
4.0,"I want to like this swimsuit so badly.  It's really cute, but it might not work for my body.  Getting the top adjusted properly is a bit of a challenge and it doesn't do much to hide my mom belly.  I might end up sending it back.<br /><br />I am a 32-year-old mother of five: 5'4&#34;, 120-125lbs, 34&#34; bust, 31&#34; waist, 39&#34; hips, long torso."
4.0,I like buckle
4.0,"I think I only ended up liking one on me, so I sent them all back."
4.0,"I probably shouldn’t admit the power media has over me, but after binging episodes of The New Girl, I decided that like the main character Jess, I too would like to wear cute pjs.  My go-to for bed is an unsightly, mismatched combo of oversized, faded t-shirts and whatever pj pants are clean.  This can result in horizontal stripes with a zebra print, Halloween dogs with somber Ivy League logos, etc. My “seasonal” pajamas are, in fact, worn year-round. (Shout out to mom for the purple pants with white schnauzers wearing red bows!). My husband never judges (at least not out loud), but I thought maybe it would be nice for him to go to bed with someone who didn’t look like they shopped exclusively in the trash bags of clothing abandoned next to those charity dumpsters in the supermarket parking lot.  Anyway, there are many scenes in The New Girl featuring Jess in her cute, quirky pjs. Inspired, I searched Amazon for something similar.  I loved the star design on these pjs and the fact that they were short-sleeved. Even though I go to bed cold, I usually wake up on fire because of our accursed Brand Name Memory Foam Mattress.  I am 5’2” and 125 lbs so I ordered the small. The pants are fine, baggy but not ginormous, with a waistband that is snug but not too tight, and I’m not tripping over the hems.  I have no beef with the pants.  The top, however, is excessively long and wide.  Somehow the sleeves are good, but I feel like I’m wearing a bowling shirt or something.  It. Is. Not. Cute.  It is not whimsical.  It makes me feel old and large.  Now, I understand that to be truly comfy, pjs can’t be super fitted.  But do they have to be big enough to accommodate Shrek?  And does the top have to be so . . . square? Like, even a little bit of a nip in at the waist could potentially help to make them feel more girly.  They really seem to be cut from the same pattern as men’s pajamas.  Is it too much to want to be cute *and* comfy for bed?  Bottom line: these are comfy, warm but not too warm, and the pattern is cute, but it would be cool if you could at least mix and match sizes.  I think an XS top might be a little better, but I know XS pants would be too snug.  If anyone knows of similar pjs that are a bit more feminine without sacrificing comfort, hit me up.  PS These did not appear to shrink after washing if you’re wondering."
4.0,"Better quality than expected. Velcro collar to secure wings around the neck, two finger loops to secure to hands. Used by an adult for a preschool play prop."
4.0,"Much bulkier than expected. The touch screen finger works fine, but it's extremely awkward to use since they are so insulated."
4.0,Great for any baseball fans nicely made looked so cute
4.0,Some were a little larger than I anticipate but seemed to be of good workmanship
4.0,I liked the dress. Very cute but I thought the main color was black. When I took it out the bag it was dark blue with floral print. Even though it was blue I decided to keep it and ordered another one with a black and floral design.
4.0,The shirt fits well and is well made.  The only problem I have is that the top button is very tight.  I had to move the button over for comfort.
4.0,"This visor works for my purposes.  It keeps the sun from shining down over the top of my sunglasses.  I would have liked it to be just a little bit bigger, but it works as is."
4.0,Great for what I paid.  The part that attaches to the watch is plastic and very difficult to attach and even more so to take off.  However for what I paid it looks great!  I love the red and get lots of compliments.
4.0,My husband really likes this belt
4.0,"Fits well, will warm my head during the winter."
4.0,I love these tights. They’re super soft and my phone fits perfectly inside the little side pocket (I have an XR plus). My only complaint...I wish I got a smaller size. It’s not as tight as I want it to be and does a weird fold at the crouch sometimes. I usually wear small so this was pretty confusing. I’m 5’5 and 120 lbs.
4.0,"It's a bit small on the wrist, it can be adjusted though."
4.0,Very thin material...exactly what we wanted. True to size. If you’re...overweight... buy a size or two larger
4.0,Thumb up buy!
4.0,"Very nice, comfortable, pretty top; great casual top for work. I ordered an xxl and it fits fine, not too confining. It doesn't fit like the pic, but everyone's body is shaped differently.<br />5'8&#34;/285/Apple"
4.0,I’ve been searching for a good walking sandal. One with some style and mostly comfort. I walk dogs and need something durable and cool. I had bought a pair of keen sandal/shoes and got huge blisters on heals. They were also to hot and twice the price. I returned them. The duinn sandals kept popping up in my search and I liked the reviews so I thought I would give them a try.
4.0,"Very cute, looks good for casual summer wear. Price is on par with the quality of the anklet."
4.0,Quality is good . But size shrinks after wash.<br /> Need to buy size up.
4.0,"I love the color and fit, I do belt it at the waist....the only thing is the slip is a bit short for me. I dress pretty modest so I turn the slip around so it's not so low cut but it still feels short. Otherwise I love the dress and great quality, very cute and summery."
4.0,"A couple of things to be aware of....<br /><br />Size: So I read ""fits up to size 60"" as sixty inch (chest, waist, whatever?) but in fact it is Euro size 60 so just a Large. The waist belt is too short to fit around my moderately generous middle. The good news is that the apron is generous size and the straps crossed in the back tend to hold the apron into your waist so the waist belt is not really needed. It's comfortable enough that I forget it is on.<br /><br />Pockets: It's hard to tell from the photos but there are only four pockets. Three on the chest and one off-center on the lower portion. It would be nice if there were more pockets - you can never have enough! The good news is my Note9 with case fits into the wide top pocket like it is made for it, so it's a good size."
4.0,I love the color. The rhinestones are a little hard to see on this color.
4.0,My son loves these pajamas. They fit him well and are very comfortable. The only disappointing thing is that the colors seem to fade a little with each wash but besides that they are great!
4.0,"Warm. I wore them as a base layer for skiing a few times and was warm and dry. I ordered a medium I’m 5’6”and 135, I wish I would have ordered a large they are a little tight but I can still wear them. I went by other reviews for sizing. Hope this helps"
4.0,Lovely dress - comfortable lightweight fabric. It was too tight across the bust but would have been too big everywhere else if I went up a side. If you're large breasted it's probably not for you.
4.0,"This kimono fits fine, and it really is a one-size-fits-all number. It's reasonably well made, but I subtracted a star because the colors don't quite match the image here. The tan is much darker, and the flowers are reddish-orange, not reddish-pink, which would have been better for my complexion. It doesn't look bad, but it's not as flattering color-wise as I had hoped.<br /><br />I did get a few compliments on the kimono, however, when I wore it last weekend. I paired it with faded jeans, a white cotton lawn sleeveless blouse and cowboy boots for a western boho look."
4.0,Love the colour. The size seems to run a little big. The fabric is very comfortable
4.0,"Silky, pretty dress. Perfect length and near perfect fit!<br />It was a bit loose around the chest, but I put a small belt with it and it felt much better!<br />I received a lot of compliments and felt comfortable the whole time!<br />It is not see-through!! The color is as shown.<br /><br />5'4 tall&#34;, 125lbs, 34C, 26&#34; waist, size 5 pants"
4.0,Pros:<br />Becomes a sphere<br />super shiny<br />it looks cool<br /><br />Cons:<br />Quite big so you can't really wear it<br />No string so if you want to make in into a necklace you gotta buy it separate<br />Kinda cheap but you get what you paid for<br /><br />Overall it's a neat knickknack but for jewelery I'd just buy something else 🤷‍♂️
4.0,"I bought these to facilitate my concurrent  addictions of reading political news while watching it on tv. The frameless style saves energy by eliminating cervical motion and requires ocular movement only. Seriously, these are lightweight, tight enough to fit my face, but the nose piece is, at times, mildly uncomfortable and is my only complaint."
4.0,These fit great.  Little girl loved them.  Lights are still working.
4.0,"They are clearly not expensive, high quality earrings, but they are cute. The free gift was fun too. :) They are worth the low price."
4.0,Works fine under boots
4.0,"I have gifted this dress to my friends daughter on her choice , it arrived after a month but worth the wait for a very nice color as in picture, fits as intended and got good compliments for the gift, will definitely recommend to all."
4.0,"I item is as described, perfect for travel."
4.0,Holds my large umbrella quite well and is adjustable enough for one larger or a smaller more normal sized one. It's nice not actually having to hold my umbrella when not actively using it. I like it.
4.0,"Now that I’m retired I wanted a compact slim wallet just for the essentials. Well i got what asked for, it’s slim all right. I guess I got what I purchased. It’s  just a bit too tight in the bills section. I find myself putting the paper money in my pocket rather than fighting to squeeze it in and out of the slim pocket"
4.0,"Beautiful, flattering,  cool and comfortable. But too short to wear as a dress. I'm only 5'4"". Had to add leggings."
4.0,I was impressed with the quality but it was a little big for my small face
4.0,Not off the shoulder but feels like luxurious fancy pajamas
4.0,"Super comfortable, but a little wide."
4.0,Good quality but a bit large
4.0,"Little larger than I thought. Really super stiff, but otherwise nice."
4.0,I thought the colors were exactly as I expected.  Love the fabric - it is heavy t-shirt type.  The style is gorgeous.  The description said &#34;midi&#34; so I expected it to at least cover my knees.  Based on the reviews I went with an L rather than an XL.  The L is a bit tight so an XL would've been better for me.  I generally wear a size 14 so I should've ordered an XL.  I am 5 10 have 36 inch long legs and my weight is in my tummy.  My looooong legs might be why the dress is above my knees.  I also wanted this as a wedding &#34;mother of the groom&#34; dress.  It was too casual for what I wanted.
4.0,I didnt check size of mask. It fits big on me but that might be my fault for not reading. Well made silky exterior and comes with filter. Fresh mask. Alittle big for me lol. Covers my whole face but design makes up for it. Great mask just had to make small adjustment
4.0,"I love this dress and will be keeping it. I thought the V neck was a bit too low cut for me.  I am wearing a slip underneath. Otherwise, I love this dress. It is wash and wear and looks like you spent much more on it. It is very comfortable, too. I am 5'3"" and carry most of my weight in my hips. I wear a 10/12 pants. In a medium, this dress was perfect and did not need to be hemmed."
4.0,I don't like the long chain but that's just my personal taste. I do like how it looks hanging on my necklace organizer. If I only use it for decoration I am happy with the purchace
4.0,I sized down from my normal size based on the measurements and these fit perfectly! They feel so soft and have the same pattern as the picture. My only complaint is that the set is a little sheer so it’s see through. Fortunately since they’re pjs it won’t be a huge deal!
4.0,It served its purpose. But they material felt Strachey. They design looks good and I received compliments. It covered the look I was going for for the event.
4.0,"Very pleased with the purchase. Exactly as advertised.Only thing, the tie brook shortly after using..."
4.0,I usually wear an XL in most workout things but these fit a bit on the smaller side. Would probably fit well if your on the slider side but if you have a bigger body type i would recommend going up one size. great product they feel great after the first wash but definitely wish i got one size up.
4.0,"They are beautiful but very tiny, so my only negative is that they tend to disappear inside my ear overnight, but I can easily push them back out. They are comfortable enough to sleep in and obviously if high enough quality to not irritate my ears. Go for it!"
4.0,"Very cute dress, but delivery was late!"
4.0,"My 15 yo grandson is a huge basketball fan so he was very excited to get this t-shirt. He praised the material and how it looked in person, but he likes his t-shirts on the loose side and even though we ordered a L, it seemed rather tight. We'll see what happens after it get washed."
4.0,"I bought this watch after falling in love with it on a cruise ship and finding a much better deal on Amazon. I must admit I was unprepared for the task of taking care of an automatic watch. After some researching I found out that its bad to manually wind them often as it wears out the crown mechanism so I bought a bellocia automatic watch winder. I have found that my watch runs fast, especially when it is highly wound which is why I only run the watch winder every other day even with the incremental start/stop cycles it includes (10 minutes on, 90 minutes off). Regardless, its a beautiful watch that I love to wear."
4.0,Fit runs a little small but still a pretty ring.
4.0,Product was not as big as I thought it was but nevertheless it was beautiful. I wore this on my wedding day and the simplicity of went well with my dress! Overall I loved it.
4.0,I like the design of these shoes. The instep is like walking on a cloud. My mother who has pain in her legs tried this on and loved the fit.
4.0,"Fits well, looks great, nice feeling material. Pretty design. Love the color and the style."
4.0,Beatyfull
4.0,"These work great, but if you are a warm person, they are to warm"
4.0,Great price great item but size is kind of small...
4.0,These leggings are comfy and cute.  Happy with quality.  The sizing is just strange.  My daughter is a tall thin 7 year old and wears a 6 of 7 slim.  I ordered the L/XL after reading other reviews and they fit well.  Overall I'm happy with this purchase.
4.0,"We ordered a size one and they’re much larger than we expected. He had 11/12s that he had outgrown but, these are more like a size three. They’re what you expect in a croc and he’ll grow into them. I’m glad we have them at such a great price."
4.0,These caps are okay. They're larger and warmed than I expected. I thought they would be cooler for summer. Still a good deal.
4.0,"The fit is good and they provide the right compression needed for standing for long periods of time.  I bought these due to pain in my feet from standing for long periods of time at work, and they have helped reduced the pain that I experience.  They shipped quickly and I have no complaints about this product."
4.0,"The fabric is so beautiful. The print is very nice, I'm usually a medium, but on the reviews I saw that a lot of people recommended to size up, that was not the case for me. Please go ahead and read the measurements before purchasing."
4.0,Good quality watch and looks very nice. Only thing wrong with it is they aren't adjustable if you need to adjust them.
4.0,I like this dress. Fits me great and I have a wide bottom and small top.
4.0,I like it .. thank you very much
4.0,"Band is very flexible, not what I was expecting but I love it! Much more flexible than the original bit band."
4.0,This was a gift for my son. He want a black stainless steel band. I am sure it will work well according to the reviews. My son is thrilled with it.
4.0,The quality is pretty nice for the price.
4.0,Look nice.  Fits bigger heads. Used for driving in car during sunny days and casual wear. Use other sunglasses for sports.
4.0,nice bright light .  works fine !  a good buy
4.0,I am usually a medium but ordered an XL per other reviews and i didn''t want the top to be tight. XL has plenty of room and I like it. It fits more like a tunic at this size.  Nice top and have received compliments. The design on the shirt is not embroidery.
4.0,"Came stained with some sort of grease or oil. was sad as I ordered it for a vacation and was not able to order another and receive it prior to leaving. It was a great coverup, very light and made me feel sexy, just wish it wasn't stained."
4.0,"These give decent traction for a toddler with the all leather bottom.  I would like it if they had some rubberized grippers on the bottom but they still do pretty well on our hardwood.  There is also no padding on the inside, they are more or less like wearing a leather sock."
4.0,"The wallet is not made extremely well, but i do love both products a lot. Very soft leather feel."
4.0,The dress is cute and feels nice. It's just too small. I really like it though. I just need to drop a few pounds before I can wear it.
4.0,"Calidad excelente del relicario, lo único malo la cadena es muy sencilla y no de tan buena calidad"
4.0,"Gloves fit well, are different colors and seem well made."
4.0,"Very cute, I love them!"
4.0,"This top is very forgiving, fits good and love the lace detail. I could have tried sizing down to a medium but was worried it would be too small."
4.0,I gave it to a friend. I sized up TWICE and still fit like a glove. I do not get it. Im not even bothering with returning or attempting to get another size .
4.0,This is gorgeous.  I wear a L or XL just depending on the shirt.  This XL is quite big so I'm exchanging for a L.
4.0,I like the dress but I took a start off because it's not flowy like the picture it's actually a tighter fit. But I use it looks good no problems:)
4.0,Somehow I got it in my head that this was a tighter/stretchier. I though it would help compress my flabby waistline a little like a girdle or spanx. Nope. It’s fine for what it is. Just know that it’s not going to help you keep your waist sucked in.
4.0,May be good for light clothing but I purposely ordered this to attach a heavyweight cloak for winter. The clasp grip to the clothing didn’t hold up to the weight or pull. However I like the middle clip that hold it tight together and easily unclipped
4.0,The fact that the dress is cotton is important for hot days and it is a great design on the fabric.
4.0,"Jacket arrived quickly.  Fits well, love the colors. Reason for only 4 stars is that the zipper on one pocket didn’t work but that wasn’t important enough for me to send it back."
4.0,This is a reasonable nice coat requiring tailor fee.
4.0,"I love tue American flag design! Id prefer a modern easier latch but it is okay and works fine. It makes me smile when i look at my watch and see our country’s flag displayed everyday, everywhere I go."
4.0,"My girlfriend has tons of earrings that were flowing out of her jewelry boxes, so I thought she'd enjoy it..and she loves it!  I may even get her another one!"
4.0,"I loved these. I have since gauged up to a 2ga (6mm), but I loved these. Well made. My only complaint is that the rubber o-rings that arrived with the product were too small for me to get back onto the studs once they had been removed in order to put the earrings in. Luckily I had some extra from my stretching kit. Also, way excessive with packaging. I received an envelope that was like a foot long by six inches wide for just these earrings."
4.0,This item is for females.
4.0,"I bought the blue tie dye in an xl as I usually wear a large & reviewers said to size up! It is saggy & loose around my ribs & waist where it's supposed to be tight. I have larger breasts at 32f & when dresses don't fit tight under my bust it makes me look chubbier than I really am. I really wish I would have gotten a large instead. I'm 5'4&#34; & the dress isn't short on me. It's actually almost too long as I have tripped on it already. It's really really cute & light weight so good for summer when you wanna dress light but cover up your upper arms which is why so got it, myself. The sleeves are like 2-3 inches shorter than they appear on the model though. Instead of reaching my elbow they rest above it which is a bummer because I had arm Lipo & I got the dress to wear out while my bruising is still healing. Sadly it doesn't cover the area. I never send anything back that I buy on the internet that fits wrong but if I did, I would def get a large or even try a medium. For scale purposes I am usually a size large, pant size 10 or 12 & 170lbs."
4.0,"It's okay.  Not the greatest quality; but, adequate for the occasional traveler.  I would think someone who travelled a lot would be wise to invest in a slightly higher quality finish; but, for our purposes it's fine."
4.0,"I usually wear mediums and this is more of a snug, tighter fit than what the model shows. Still a super cute shirt, just doesn’t flow like some people might want it to!"
4.0,"Bought these for my son...16 years old, 6 feet, 160 lbs. They are loose and run a bit big. But he wanted to show off his chest so I think they do the trick. Haha."
4.0,The sole is thin but I look #fierce during infusions
4.0,My size is Large but I wished I ordered X-Large
4.0,"Beware of ordering these shoes in the wrong size.  The shoes are mens sizes so you have to make sure you order womens equivalent. These shoes are a bit heavy and are not made for any comfort or support.  They're cute shoes that aren't made to walk a 5K in, let's just say that.  By the end of the day I'm sick of wearing them and ready for something more comfortable.  I get alot of compliments on them.  I had to order these shoes 3 times to get the right size and they still feel a bit big, but I think the next size down would be too small.  If you love dogs, these are great shoes, but if you have issues with your feet hurting in even &#34;comfortable&#34; shoes, these are not for you....."
4.0,"These pearls are pretty, only problem I have is hard to fasten the bracelet by myself."
4.0,I ordered a M but got a L. I didn’t feel like the hassle of exchanging so I decided to wash it to see if it shrinks. It doesn’t shrink at all. It is baggy on me but I love the style and I actually don’t mind it oversized. Really cute pattern/tie dye style.
4.0,"These are so comfy and warm. Very well made slippers, no missed stitches, or threads hanging out. Soles are solidly fixed on the slippers. Plus I can wear them outside to get the mail. Win,win in my book."
4.0,"Larger than I anticipated, but it can be belted."
4.0,"Quite nice and I appreciate that despite being a small size it accomodates my C-cups. Bottom has nice coverage. But not sure if the bra give enough support. While the pads and the shoulder straps are sturdy, the back strap is not, and rides up my back. Might return."
4.0,The bra part kept needing adjusted.
4.0,In could wish for a longer chain...
4.0,The hat fits fine. Love the colors and the Pom Pom. The hat reminds me of when I was a little kid. Lol
4.0,"So I will say this dress is made of very thick good quality material and feels like an exspensive prom dress or bridesmaid dress.<br />It is excellent quality and very beautiful in person.<br /><br />It has a sturdy built in bra and is perfect formal wear.<br /><br />The size chart is mostly accurate and that's what I went off of to order but unfortunately it's just not meant for my body type.<br /><br />To be fair I have extremely broad shoulders for a woman, with a thick ribcage, wide back, and large bust.<br />It fits absolutely perfect in the waste and actually pretty well I'm the bust but doesn't zip at the very top where I'm much broader. If I had went up any larger though it would have been too big in the waste and not looked shapely.<br /><br />I would say this is still perfect for your average female but if you're built like me then err on the side of caution.<br /><br />It is VERY long which I love but I'm 5'10 so keep that in mind if you're shorter it will likely be dragging the floor so just plan for that. It's not at all uncommon  with these types of gowns and I think it definitely adds to the beauty if it!<br /><br />The silhouette is beautiful and figure flattering and I think this would be perfect for prom, weddings, or photoshoots!<br /><br />Overall I think my issues are own problem and no fault of the dress so I would still reccomend it based on its quality. I wear a 42 inch band size so I would say anyone up to 38 would have no problem. May e even up to 40!"
4.0,I was missing one of the balls but other than that everything is perfect.
4.0,"Bought this in a small for my daughter (16). She is 5'7"", 108 lbs. Fits perfectly, looks great. She loves it!"
4.0,It's very pretty and does not look cheap at all.
4.0,its okay. not exactly like the pictures but fair enough. not very stretchy and the glitter is not as noticeable as it is on the models top. ill wear it. :)
4.0,The pendant was smaller than anticipated and necklace chain was too short. Giving it to my granddaughter instead because she is petite and would be the appropriate size for her.
4.0,I wasn’t sure about the middle lace being open so I bought a full slip / petty coat to go under it and you couldn’t tell it’s was even open. I got so many complements on how classy it looked. Love it!
4.0,The dress is really comfortable and it's a little bit I got a small and I'm 4'10 130 so it's a little long but that's normal! It is a little see through in certain spots but I wore a tank underneath just because I feel more comfortable that way! I would definitely recommend the dress especially if going on vacation!
4.0,Works well. Looks good. Easy install.
4.0,Bought for our daughter and she absolutely loves it.
4.0,Looks sharp.  Fits well once the adjustment is complete.
4.0,"Easy to take off, nice space for Atm, good price."
4.0,Great quality t- shirt. Soft material. Runs a bit large.
4.0,Love the color a lot. The frame is a tad to small. But still sleek
4.0,"Cute and very stylish. A little big for my daughter's wrist, but can manage."
4.0,"Ordered a size large, fit good but could have gone for a medium the pants are very long meant to be worn with heels"
4.0,Beautiful and cute
4.0,"One arrived broken, but apart from that very cute set of small earings. Not real silver so may cause irritation if left in ear overnight"
4.0,THE PERFECT TIGHTNESS AND NOT TO WARM
4.0,These earrings can be worn when dressing up or down.  They glimmer when the lights hit the hearts.  I bought them to match a heart pendant I purchases.  They are almost a perfect match.
4.0,"They definitely have a very supportive grip and flexibility when walking, but they tend to fall off my son’s feet often. They fit perfectly when they are dry but slip off when playing in the water."
4.0,This skirt fits pretty cute but it gives too much. It is way too stretchy.
4.0,"Awesome product. This is a menacing looking blade. Very well made and feels solid while holding the contoured polycarbonate handle. Knife is heavy at the blade end so it is easy to swing like a machete. I did want the knife with green guard and window breaker but they sent knife with black guard and window breaker. Not reason enough to send back. Nylon sheath is well made.  delivered very quickly. Overall this is a great knife and an even better price. Just don't expect the knife to have green guard, window breaker, or green bolts in handle. If they had sent me the right knife I would have rated 5 stars!!!!"
4.0,"Nice belt, the adjustment area is a bit closer to the end of the belt, which makes it more appealing to me, as  it allows you to not have a large amount of belt end sticking out and flapping around, as it seems some forget that these belts do not have built in loops to hold the end of the belt close in to body, as most pants only have a belt loop near the belt buckle, and the next one is 6 to 8 inches away, which can leave a lot of belt flapping around."
4.0,Good pricing for a small wallet . Perfect for a few items
4.0,Lightweight material perfect for Florida summer
4.0,earrings and they were a little smaller than I thought.
4.0,I didn't like the fact it had fuz all over the in side I had to wash it to get it all out of the inside lineing packaging was great
4.0,Ears worked well. I thought the tail should be a bit slimmer and maybe a bit longer.
4.0,A bit large for its size but the quality and texture is good..
4.0,"The panties are very nice, look super cute on. Fabric is of goog quality, just... the waist line is somewhat small to your hip and it makes a punch line which might look a bit funny for your hip. Ill try to expand it latter to make it look better. Btw, im a constant fit size 0, and always have good fit whenever I buy clothes online."
4.0,The cut is flattering and the material is of a nice thickness but still has some stretch.  Only took off one star because when it arrived it had a hole in the seam.  Luckily it appears it will be an easy fix as soon as I figure out how to sew.
4.0,"I was a bit surprised at the small size when I got it, but it turned out to be the correct size for what you are doing. Getting into those smaller areas on the crown or inside it works well. The bristles are not too stiff yet not as loose as a shoe brush. I will say that there was a small amount of shedding of the black bristles while doing the first hat. I just did three more and there was no additional shedding. We shall, of course, see how it holds up over time but right now I would recommend it."
4.0,My 8yr old granddaughter like them very shiny good price
4.0,Nice color and pattern. Lightweight fabric that I like. Fit is a bit long and loose for a petite. I think I will still enjoy wearing it.
4.0,I loke
4.0,"This is an adorable robe. The print is so cute, its soft and warm. The only thing I'd say is that its hard to get the sizing right. My toddler is a 2T-3T and sometimes with these Chinese brands they go by 100,110,120 etc. At first I had no idea what size she is on that scale, it took some trial and error, but just to be on the safe side I ordered the largest I could find, the 140.<br />When I got the robe the tag said 5-6years. Its big on her which is totally fine, I'd rather have a larger size that she can use later than a smaller unusable one.<br />Remember that this is fleece so you can't use it straight outta the shower. I usually dry my toddler with a towel first and then put this on her and she gets all warm and toasty! But make sure they are totally dry before you put this on because it does leave behind lint."
4.0,Little sister big sister matching.true to size
4.0,The shawl is cute.  But has a weird safety pin.
4.0,"The product came as advertised, lots of pieces of jewelry. For the price it's a good find. The jewelry is obviously cheaply made and some pieces fell apart after a few days of wear, but for the price it's absolutely worth it."
4.0,"Love these! I wear them for yoga, pilates, and light weight lifting during a class I take. They are comfy and breathable, and the grip makes it so much easier. The only thing is they start to dig in between your fingers after a little bit so I have to start adjusting them just over halfway through class."
4.0,"I ordered my usual size (XL) and it fits perfect but it's made out of that weird stretchy almost swimsuit-like material that a lot of leggings and things are made out of, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it's so cute I'm not going to complain. It clings to my body and emphasizes my stomach so I've been wearing it under a cardigan to kind of hide that, but if I were to wear it alone I'd definitely use some shapewear or wear high waist jeans to smooth out my stomach"
4.0,I wear 36 jeans and these XL briefs fit well. Comfortable.
4.0,Cute but the placement of the name tag on draws the eye right to the crotch. My daughter thinks this is the cutest swimsuit in the world.
4.0,"color was like i wanted and anyone else i think would ,if they liked that shade of blue . IT is what i have been looking for"
4.0,"Love the stretchy ness of the fabric and it’s very comfortable, but the fit is a bit tight in the arms. Definitely go up 1 size. I got the 2XL and it fits like an xl."
4.0,I may have bought the wrong size but they are way to difficult to get on my chunky calf and the top band digs in a little. May not be the case for everyone. Size chart should have calf measurements not just shoe size.
4.0,"Nice hat and provides good coverage.  It is a bit too floppy, however.  Also, I liked the back cover until I went into the water and it got all wet.  If you are just using for yard work or walking around, it would be good."
4.0,I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter..... it was a nice swimsuit fit her well
4.0,I really wanted to live this dress but it ran too big. It was baggy in the waist and the chest.<br /><br />I'm 5'7&#34; 155lbs 41-30-38 34FF
4.0,Had ordered the white socks & then reordered the black socks. Hard to get out the dirt stains on white socks.
4.0,"I have bigger calves and a small foot so I felt like the compression on my calf was perfect but there's too much material down at the toes. If I give my toes slack and place them in my shoe perfectly, it doesn't bother me. If I can't get it right then it either bunches up by my pinky toe and causes a blister or presses my toes together and makes my pinky toenail rub against my 4th toe."
4.0,it helps organize the suitcase and I'll probably buy one more set. only problem is that in one of the big cubes the net is no longer attached to the rest of the fabric
4.0,"Bottoms were a little snug, and not very stretchy at all. But overall, great but, can't beat the price!"
4.0,"I like it, just not a slouchy which is what I wanted , more like a beanie and I have a small head, and not as light weight as I thought it would be, but, still a good value."
4.0,"The fabric is like that of a Halloween costume or a stripper outfit...disappointing. The cut is nice, though."
4.0,"Rose gold matches Apple Watch perfect. Easy to attach band. Only complaint is I have tiny wrists, so I have to wrap the whole thing around my wrist. There’s really no possibility to adjust."
4.0,2nd time buying these footbeds.  Can't get the boots to die so I'm having to buy these about once a year.  Would probably prefer replacing after 6 months if they didn't cost so much.
4.0,I like this chain. It looks like the picture. It might have been nice to be able to adjust the length a bit.
4.0,Love it!! Cute and great price.
4.0,"These are really lovely earrings went the colors are perfect. Love how neutral they are. Pretty easy to clasp, however there only thing I would change is adding time clear backs to them so they don't come unclipped. These would make a great favor at a party."
4.0,"Super soft and comfortable, fits perfect! I bought an XL as I usually wear and glad I did! Only problem is it is thin and you can see right through it. I had to wear a cami underneath and tuck the top in my strapless bra LOL"
4.0,"After reading several of the reviews I took a chance and bought these earrings.  They were perfect for what I needed, a simple pair of gold studs.  The earrings themselves are fantastic, the backings however leave a little bit to be desired.  The don’t feel very secure when you put them on, but if you have another pair of earrings with a more  supportive backing you can easily solve that issues.  Other than the backing issue it’s a no brainer to buy these at such a reasonable price."
4.0,Made out of glass so be careful and do not drop them
4.0,"Low cut. Nice length, just below knee. Need to iron. Wrinkles."
4.0,"Update:  So I found out this mask is a knockoff of a mask that originally cost $1000 made in Australia.  You can find videos made by the original creator called Jack of the Dust on Youtube.  Infact, the spiky leather coat guy in the advertisements is of the Jack of the Dust mask.  That mask is thicker and made out of much higher quality materials.  That mask is also no longer for sale.<br /><br />That being said, for a knockoff, its pretty decent for the price.  As you will see in my original review, I have seen different versions of this mask.  They are all knockoffs from different makers.<br /><br />Original Review: What an interesting release for a mask!  First saw this advertised on yahoo.com by a website that looked kind of shady.  I really liked the mask, but didn't want to get scammed.  Did an amazon search and found it pretty easily... but noticed it was being sold at a large variety of price ranges, while having almost identical marketing.  The pictures you see most often are with the guy in the leather jacket with spikes.  Looking at different listings, some would have a video at the end that looked like it was filmed by the people selling it, rather than the spiky leather coat guy.<br /><br />I've seen like 3 variations.  2 others where the skull looks floppy and baggy on the persons head, one with built in eyeballs and the other with large eye cutouts.  The one I received was definitely the one being worn by the spiky leather coat guy.  The skull itself looks the best of the variations, as it is tight fitting to your head rather than being floppy and baggy.  I had to squeeze my head in and out of it, but I like that as I think it makes it look much better.  It comes with a foam pad in the chin that you might have to cut with a knife to get it to fit your face, but is nice because it helps with better jaw movement.<br /><br />On the downsides, the eye holes are kind of small, and kind of touch my eyeballs. Im going to have to cut them slightly, or I just dont think Ill make it a full night with it on.  After looking at the other variations, I feel this is the best looking skull, but possibly not the best clown face.  This clown face is floppy and looks like it has no shape of its own.  Other variations look to possibly have a more detailed clown face with a nice looking scar over the right eye rather than red paint like this one has.  Would we have to get 2 variations to create the ultimate face rip mask? Maybe, I haven't done it myself, not to mention the face is held on by magnets, and who knows how the other faces are held on.<br /><br />Overall, I am going to say this is a pretty cool mask!  Not knowing what the other variations look like, the clown face is certainly serviceable, and the skull itself is kind of terrifying.  I am afraid of showing it to kids as it would probably give them nightmares!"
4.0,"we ordered them a size bigger because of sizing chart.  did not need to do that, but they didnt look that large once on.  Really liked that they came in talls too.  nice vests"
4.0,Thought it was going to be small but was surprised it fit well. Ordered size large.
4.0,Love it but it but it gets dirty very easily
4.0,"Boot runs small, got a size in so It’s a nice snug fit"
4.0,"Cute outfit for a afternoon outing.  However, the shirt (sleeves) fits really small to be a LARGE.  My normal size for shirts like this would be a Med.  I purchased the Large for the ""Butt"" room in the shorts : )  Thank goodness I didn't purchase a Med because the shirt would fit close to a x-small.  In order for it not to look so small on me - I have cut the sleeves and made it into a tank."
4.0,Got the job done in NY in January.
4.0,"This was a pretty piece of jewelry, but it turned out to be smaller than I'd expected. As I already HAD a larger (and more attractive) similar piece, I elected to return the item."
4.0,"Sturdy, could use a small zipper compartment on outside."
4.0,Nice kurthi
4.0,"Super cool and sturdy but heavier than expected.  It's the weight of almost a roll of quarters.  I repurposed the clasp on necklace to turn it into a clip for the lanyard I wear at work with my work ID.  I can feel the weight on my neck which I don't like.<br /><br />The chain is brittle and broke easily.<br /><br />Oh, be sure to take the plastic off the button the sets the watch.  The battery isn't dead.  Once the button is pushed in the second hard starts to move.  I bought a battery before I realized this."
4.0,They’re absolutely gorgeous but very heavy. And the metal hook isn’t very good quality.
4.0,Very nice and work great
4.0,Dress was great as far as quality of fabric and the way it wwas put together.  However it was way too small.
4.0,"This is a good dress. It fit nice and snug and I recieved many compliments throughout the night. My measurements are about 36-26-36 and I'm about 5'3 on the muscular/curvy side. It fell about mid calf and was not see-through at all! It has about two layers of fabric and there is no need for spanx because it does a good job of smoothing everything over. My only issue (not a big issue for me, though) was that the layer of fabric underneath had seams that didn't seem to stay aligned with the top layer's seam. I don't know if that makes much sense but you can't really see it too much anyway because it's on the sides. All in all, I would recommend this"
4.0,"It's a cute lounge fall/winter outfit, but I wish I got it in X-Large. The top is a little too short for my comfort level and the pants aren't baggy on me... Then again, my body type isn't identical to the listing model's body. I'll keep it because I anticipate on losing a couple of pounds in the future, so I might like the fit after I follow through with that.<br />All in all, the fabric is typical sweat shirt fabric and perfect for fall/winter weather."
4.0,Good shoe for those with neuropathy because of the cushioning...I wish it had a little more though.  The shoe is a little heavy.
4.0,It was very ORANGE!
4.0,I like the lightness and comfort of the material.
4.0,"The top of these socks are more square than others I have tried, which I like because the corners don't show when I wear them with loafers.  They are small, and I wouldn't recommend them for anyone over a size 8-  even an 8 is pushing it.  The heel stays on pretty well.  I machine washed them, and they came out fine.  I like the colors!"
4.0,Could have been designed thinner and still help the capacity. Otherwise great.
4.0,"Beautiful, I purchased this as a gift for my husband  &amp; he loves it.  The directions for winding the watch is a bit confusing."
4.0,"The product quality was great however, I had to return it as it was too big for me."
4.0,"really a different concept as far as watches go., very comfortable"
4.0,"Runs small. The XL didnt fit my mother but my 17 year old niece loved the shirt. I did try on the shirt and usually wear a medium in all clothes but this for fine, sleeves were a little long though. The color is pretty and we all loves the detail."
4.0,"Nice skirt. Wish they came in more colors in my size. I had to return the medium for the large, even though I'm a size 8. It was too tight around the waste band."
4.0,Not very waterproof I instantly got wet with a large splash soaked right through
4.0,"The material is slightly thicker than T-shirt material, making it warmer and still soft.  The arms fit tight, just enough to keep the drafts out.  I love the length, it stays below my knees when I'm tossing and turning."
4.0,I ordered a size up and they fit pretty well. Definitely not Capri length on short people. I’m 5’2 and they are only a 1/2 in from the floor on me.
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): These earrings are pretty but a bit cheap looking.  I like the design with the large green stone in the middle and faux diamonds surrounding.  However, the larger size makes the earrings a bit gaudy.  The clasps would also look better if they were silver or gold in color, rather than black.<br /><br />The earrings come nicely packaged."
4.0,Love this wallet! Met all our expectations. It's still holding strong years later. I do not recommend it if you like to carry a lot of cash or cards. Make sure you do your research. It tells you the max cards and cash that can fit.<br />I just have one complaint. We ordered orange and silver and got orange and black. We kept the black. It’s actually really nice and not worth the hassle to return. My complaint is more just about the principle of it. Funny side note. TSA stops us every time we travel with this wallet. So be prepared.
4.0,"The Guess Mens 'GU 6599P' Polarized Aviator Sunglasses, Black / Gray are beautiful and has a good design too, maybe i dont like the package when they arrived, it is a bag( it is possible that the product brokes with a crash)"
4.0,"For some reason these men's support hose are listed as the same size and compression and the Lish ladies compression socks.  So I tried them because I  wanted a neutral gray.  The men's hosiery that I purchased run much tighter in the calf but the same size in the foot area.  I have worn them, but they are not very comfortable.  I would recommend sticking with the ladies Lish hosiery.  Perhaps they will add more colors in the future.  They are great support but growing a bit warm as summer approaches."
4.0,I've had these for about a year now and I love them. The only problem is the back pocket ripped a little. Other than that they've been perfect
4.0,Fit as expected. My measurements are 33w and 32 L and the large fits me fine.
4.0,nice necklace :)
4.0,"Bigger than one would expect for a keychain, but light, so not an issue. Bought it for my 4 yo daughter because she fell in love wth it, and she is literally watching me write this so I can share that &#34;It's really cute&#34;. It was a success with her. Stiches aren't perfect, but looks durable enough."
4.0,"For the price, I am pleased."
4.0,"easy to maintain, love the pattern, zippers easy to use, shoulder strap does not slip off the shoulder, good front pockets"
4.0,"This worked perfectly for my needs (weighted pull ups as well as loaded carries), everything is durable and high quality except for the buckle, which can easily be broken should weights fall on it (or someone steps on it). This happened to me and for whatever reason I'm unable to find a replacement latching mechanism in the same size anywhere online or in Fitness stores, leaving me using this with a carabiner or just using a chain and dealing with the discomfort.<br /><br />I'd love to find a replacement for the latch part, as it is the side used to actually tighten the strap and therefore isn't actually sewn in and should be easily replaced...if I could find the right size piece.<br /><br />Otherwise I highly recommend this with the caveat that you should be mindful of not dropping the belt on the floor to prevent anything from falling on it/being stepped on."
4.0,Great lightweight Art Deco style earrings - good quality. Have gotten lots of compliments when I wear them - only drawback is the backs for the earrings are tough to get on and off - would recommend using different ones than the rubber backs they send.
4.0,"They worked, but were a little too tight. Wore them for long airplane days. After 10 hours they start to roll and become a little uncomfortable, but still better than without."
4.0,Soft and nice. Very light weight but it is kinda big but still workout. Thanks
4.0,"runs a little small for my taste, go one size bigger. They don't make them like they use to. Waste line is good,but the length is short"
4.0,Its small. Looks diffrent but its still cute.
4.0,"Cheaply made, but works for a costume you might wear only a few times."
4.0,"If you zoom the photo you can see the backs are white only reason not 5 stars, hair up you will want a different pair.  They lock well, make sure the back  is all the way engaged by doing a test pull.  You must squeeze the 2 side latches together to remove."
4.0,This dress fits good! And there is a side zipper as well.
4.0,This jacket is heavier than I expected and warm too!  I'm petite so the arm length was a little too long.  The packaging that Amazon delivered it in was horrible though.  It was in a ziplock type of plastic bag that anybody could have opened and worn.
4.0,I love the style and color of this beautiful top but I wish it was a little bit longer on the torso.
4.0,Very Pretty jacket
4.0,"Worth the money. Smaller than I thought they would be and didn't look much like angel wings when I looked at them, but they are exactly what they look like in the picture, but the diamond has a tint of blue which is beautiful."
4.0,Sides under the armpits are a bit &#34;poofy&#34;/bulky (doesn't really sit flat) but since I use these for PJs it doesn't matter much to me.
4.0,"I am very pleased with this dress! Since I read the reviews I knew to expect the fabric to be a little thin (honestly, since I was wearing all day outside at in hot weather I was happy it was thinner). I usually wear an 18 US and ordered the 4x. The waist and bust fit great but the neckline was a little too large for me so I altered it a bit on my sewing machine. Other than that I love it! Worth the price for sure."
4.0,"Doesn't match the stock picture exactly. The dial is a flake metallic and slightly off-white, and the chrono hands are more orange. The strap stitching matches perfectly, but it is definitely orange. All in all it looks great in person, but is not as subtle as it looks in the stock photos."
4.0,A bit too small around fits a med size man without being stretched out.  The neck should come down further to stop drafts.  Good idea but seems like they cut some corners on execution.  Did not hold up well in the wash lots of pilling on the fabric.
4.0,"Runs 2 sizes small. Comfortable, soft, and great for informal events."
4.0,This is a very pretty bracelet.  The crystals are stunning and the extender allows more movement and fit for not so tiny wrists.  It will be a gift so hoping the person will love it.  Very nice quality for the price.
4.0,Somewhat smaller than a true large. I usually wear a size small/medium but after reading reviews I bumped it up to a large knowing that with a lot of wash and wear and tear these types of tank tops shrink. The large fits me perfectly before washing. I'm about a 35 inch bust C/D. I recommend no dryer if you don't want this to shrink.  If not for the size discrepancy I would give this five stars.
4.0,"Style, size ok"
4.0,"What a giggle! It's nice at this time to be able to make people smile, and the actual mouth movement helps communication. Not as comfy as I'd like, but good enough for occasional use. Warning: it scared the heck out of my horses!"
4.0,"Overall it's cute. But don't be afraid to size up. I got an XL and when I got it, the sleeves were too tight, and it was a tad short on me. So I just wore it tied up at the front with shorts (aka as a shirt haha)"
4.0,Beautiful!! But they would not size it for a man as advertised. I kept it for myself and ordered another for a friend.
4.0,They are two tight for my wife
4.0,Very helpful with packing.  Made it so much easier and kept everything clean when one bag with shampoo bottles in a ziplock bag failed.<br /><br />On zipper tag came off one the second day of use.
4.0,Works great. Love being able to shove a nice shirt into my backpack for later!<br /><br />Had to drop a star because my shirts come out of this smelling awful! Neoprene nastiness that is not ideal for heading to dinner with friends.<br /><br />Will keep this for emergency shirt. But can’t use it often with the dmell.
4.0,Bought it because of the price as a gift for a size 8 friend. But this 8 fits perfectly my size 4-6. Have kept it for myself. Wear it in the swimming pool for about a month now. So far so good. Recommend it.
4.0,"I actually like these a lot. But let me tell you, they are not compressive at all. In spite of them being so thin and light, they are not see thru at all. So squat test passed. And NO CAMELTOE! Thank you. But I don’t give it 5 stars because I don’t as expecting a little more compression"
4.0,"If you use their size chart it's fine.  BF usually wears a L, but ordered a XL and it fit fine"
4.0,Great top but does run large. I would size down.
4.0,"Absolutely love the material, it's so soft and super cute top.  The only draw back is I'm 5'8"" and I just wish it was a little longer."
4.0,As described no surprises
4.0,Fits great shows just enough stomach.
4.0,A bit larger then I wanted but it is a very nice wallet.
4.0,I thought it would be a little bit bigger...<br />don't recall dimensions being specified in description.<br />Best word to describe:  dainty.<br />It is a sweet necklace & hits me right at the collar bone.<br />Nice piece for the price.
4.0,"I ordered this for a 80's costume I was putting together.  I'm 5' 7"" and 178 lbs, so I ordered the largest possible size of XL.  When they showed up and I removed them from the package I was sure they weren't big enough to fit a child let alone me.  But they stretch very well and the fit was actually really good.  Of course they were VERY tight and VERY short, but that just added to the look!  The fabric is really soft too."
4.0,The dress is very nice. The material feels good and not cheap. The lace is good quality. Sturdy zipper. It fits great.
4.0,Fit was good but tight across shoulders when reaching ahead or up.
4.0,I'm very happy with my purchase. I am 5 feet and it's over my knee which I was pleased with.
4.0,Easy to put in and no little captured ball to lose love them
4.0,"I really liked this dress from the photos and had high expectations when I ordered it.  While I'm not completely let down, there was a definitely disappointment when I put the dress on.  I don't have an hourglass figure or anything close, but there are dresses that I like on a bit better than this one.  The neckline wasn't what I was expecting.  The structure/shape of the dress is different from the photo, which looks like it would accentuate one's smaller waist.  It's a nice casual dress for work and I will certainly wear it there.  The material is nice and I had no issues with the zipper.  Nothing wowed me about this dress though.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. When reviewing, I consider the full price and evaluate the product's usefulness and/or quality. When I find that something breaks or malfunctions after further testing, I do update my reviews accordingly."
4.0,Very easy to wear. Dress up or down. Love it!#
4.0,first pair were defective. safe sparks read my initial review and sent out a new pair apologizing for defective product. Gloves were much better. Customers service with this company is great. they really put customer first and care about there product.
4.0,"Great, I can feel the difference. Wish I could have estimated the size a little better."
4.0,Few of the tassels were already off when I open the package and some fell off.  Overall cute!!
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, incredible quality for the price."
4.0,A little dark but you get what you pay for
4.0,"If you need a bright red fluffy collar for some reason, you won’t be disappointed with this. I would be careful washing it, but it looks just like the listing pics. The small fit a 5’3”, 115lb woman just fine."
4.0,Ring a little to big but I love it
4.0,"It's a little smaller than expected, but the seller warned of this so I ordered above babies size, and I'm glad I did because this outfit is super cute!"
4.0,Seems very heavy duty and fits my watch perfectly. The only thing is that it’s thicker than I would have liked. Other than that it seems like a great replacement.
4.0,Zipper fragile but loved it
4.0,Comfortable however they tend to stretch out a bit after wearing but afyerv washing them they do return to they're normal size ☺
4.0,"They are cool, just make sure you know that the front sticks out and is not flat against your ear"
4.0,"Even if they dont get worn, these little piggies were too cute to pass up for that piggie lover in your life!"
4.0,You can't tell from the pictures of it on Prime but it is very very sheer material.
4.0,My daughter loves it. She is 10 amd not a girly girl- BUT she is into cosplay- especially animae. For whatever reason this hat spoke to her:) it works great and is really soft. It’s not super heavyweight the wars are king and they work well. No issues. Super soft!
4.0,"It's fits ok, I went half size larger based on the previous reviews, and it was a mistake.  The fit is exactly as marked, a little bigger than my normal size and a little wider too.  Overall, it's a good flip flop for the pool."
4.0,"It  was nice , just bigger than I thought it would be."
4.0,Nice looking band. The holes are spaced further apart than what I'm used to. The may be because the buckle is so large. I do like it
4.0,This watch-winder is easy to use with clear switch markings for the turns per day and direction.<br />When first used it was was near silent but after a few months it is now audible in the living room if there is no background noise. Therefore I would advise it may be too loud for some if used on a nightstand/bedroom.
4.0,one of my favorite scarves and I have a lot :-)
4.0,"They run a size small, so if you're a size 38, order a size 40. Feels comfortable, lots of pockets."
4.0,"I got a mixture of different underwear, some fit better than others even though they were supposed to be all the same. I have a feeling that they have been sitting around awhile considering I received a pair of hannah montana panties."
4.0,"Great shirt at a great price. Came fast, no issues. A+++ seller."
4.0,"Ok for what I paid for them. Very thin and light weight, but they serve the purpose as around the house liesure and yoga pants."
4.0,"These are really cute compression socks, and they fit very well.  The compression seems a bit less than with some of my socks, but they are adequate.  The quality is good.  These are a medium weight sock - lighter than many sports socks, but heavier than dress socks."
4.0,Good socks do shrink.
4.0,Very cute boots but the finishing is not great.<br />I bought 2 sizes up. My son usually wears a 9 but I bought 11 and it fits pretty well.<br />Everyone loved it at his preschool
4.0,"Cute set, great clasp for longer nail ladies like myself. ;) 4 stars because I’ve worn the solid chain twice and it has 2 kinks in it that won’t set back to normal.  It’s not that noticeable, but stands out to me."
4.0,"These are a little heavier weight than I expected, but do not look like lounge pants and will be good for summer.  The color listed as khaki should really say  mustard.  They look pretty much like the picture."
4.0,"Very nice, just as expected.  Vivid colors."
4.0,I greeted  my husband in this when he came home one night. He was pleasantly surprised.
4.0,Unlike a lot of xx-large shirts this one is a full cut with lots of room.  Lots of times I order 2xl because the xl tends to be cut small and short but this one has lots of room and is soft/comfortable.
4.0,"My grandfather had a well-used pocket watch that we wanted to display. We found this perfect glass dome with a walnut-color base that we now use for this purpose. The brass finial on top looks great. Only complaint is that the hook inside is pretty thick and clumsy - looking more like a cup hook that something to display fine watches. However, the watch looks great, it is protected from dust and we're happy to have it out where people can see it."
4.0,Great quality and great looking shirt. It fits like a euro size . Large was very small
4.0,"Didn't fit in all the places it needed to fit. Not a very stylish dress when you get it on,  nice material."
4.0,Great product will still buy another one
4.0,I like these they could have been a little bigger.
4.0,"The wallet is more like a clutch with compartments and spaces for credit cards, id, etc. The zipper compartment in the center of the wallet was described to fit an iPhone 6Plus. After trying for a while I was finally able to get my phone past the zipper but I was afraid I would tear the wallet or break the zipper, especially trying to get the phone back out. It is very nice and the leather feels great but I think I know what my sister is getting for her birthday next month (she has the smaller iphone6)."
4.0,"Good fit, not too wide. comfortable material. Was looking for this shirt for a long time and finally found it here!"
4.0,"Super cute and comfy, but runs a bit small"
4.0,Just what we needed for the sink we installed in the flip we just completed. The extra hole was easily fixed by installing this brushed nickel soap dispenser. It looks really nice and does what it is meant to do. No issues with it so far and it was installed over a month ago.
4.0,Wish it were waterproof
4.0,"I've only had these for a couple of weeks, but so far I am very pleased with them.  The magnification is just right, and they sit comfortably on my nose.  My only complaint is that they are a bit snug."
4.0,My grandson loves his bright pink shirt!
4.0,It's really a great battle belt. The reason it doesn't work for me is in two ways. One is has two belt loops in the back with Velcro so you can use belt loops on your pants with the belt. The Velcro made it very annoying to deal with. The other reason which is the main reason is with all my gear it wasn't hold my pants up.  The pants I used are not loose and the weight was pulling them down. Of course that's not a problem you want with a battle belt.
4.0,"Great fit, good cushioning for comfort level"
4.0,In love with this soft true to size elegant peace. Can dress it up or down
4.0,The mask is good but if you have a longer nose to chin measurement (more than 6.5”) or a fuller face these may not stay under your chin. Attached is a photo that compares a KN95 (left) mask to the KF94 (right). This KN95 is cut fuller which accommodates a typical larger male face.  It’s very hard to know how masks will fit until you try one. on
4.0,"I get lots of compliments on these. They are a bit heavy and fall off. So, be cautious."
4.0,"I really like this dress. It’s lightweight, and comfortable, perfect for Florida summer. The only things I’m not too crazy about are the buttons. They were kinda loose, and one button actually fell out, I had to sew it back on.<br />Btw, I’m 5’8”, about 157lbs, and 36C. I bought a large, and it’s kinda loose fit on me."
4.0,I like this choker. Its very basic kind of like a strip of velvet but its still nice. I like that it has an adjustable chain. I did not get 3 pc I got the one that is plain black velvet.
4.0,It's really pretty. The strap looks a little off and there's a Strong smell on the inside. But nothing that's a deal breaker. I really like it.
4.0,"The material is super thin, so I was alitlle surprised...thought they'd be thicker."
4.0,"These are high-waisted but not saggy, which is what I was looking for. They do not have that granny panty look because the material is flat and stretchy. I wish they had a cotton liner--pantie liners don't stick to the underwear. But for the price, they are adequate"
4.0,Needs to come with directions
4.0,It had a lot of sparkle to it and color
4.0,Good comfortable product.  I like the skin feel better than terry cloth.
4.0,Wife is enjoying them
4.0,Comfortable and practical. I sleep much better with a comfortable eye mask :)
4.0,"If you have big breasts, size up. I’m a 34D/32DD/28 waist and I had a bit of spillage on the sides, so the medium was just a bit snug. I will buy a large next time. Otherwise, this fits great. The material is good quality and feels good against the skin."
4.0,Affordable polarized sunglasses without frame. Exactly what I needed for my triathlons. Glasses with a frame across the top obscure visibility when down on the aero bars. This glasses work great and cut the glare. They making coming in and out of bright sun to shade much safer than non-polarized glasses. The arms are comfortable and grippy without squeezing the sides of my head. My only complaint is the nose piece came unsnapped too easily. I may add some dab of glue to assure it doesn't come dislodged so easily.
4.0,"I purchased these goggles for my 4 year old and 7 year old sons for swimming lessons this year. Both have rather large noggins - but they fit beautifully. The material was fantastic for two kids who have sensory issues when it comes to their hair. They can both put the goggles on unassisted as well as remove them.<br />After about 6 months of lessons, my 4 year old's goggles stretched out and water starts filling the lenses when he is swimming. I removed a star because there is no way to tighten them, so they must be replaced.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase them again - just don't expect them to last forever!<br /><br />I can imagine if I had girls these would be amazing - they would accommodate a pony tail! :)"
4.0,"Great bag for the value. I have just used a couple of days. The leather is really soft and the inside has a quality lining fabric. The photos do not show the outside pocket on the back, it is perfect for your phone, keys."
4.0,"This is beautiful, I wire it to my church banquet and it stood out. Would buy it again."
4.0,EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER VERY NICE PRODUCT
4.0,"Compared this with all other similar items before purchase based on photos provided and thought this is the best available, well this indeed looks pretty good in quality. No smeared spots on the buckle, stitches are not of Ralph Laurent quality but price is 1/4 only, the material of the braided belt itself is also good with good color dye. After using it for 50 days the belt does extend for about one inch, so definitely order one size smaller as some other reviewers mentioned (and I really appreciate their input). Overall, this is a recommended item."
4.0,Great glove. Love that it lights up.
4.0,"These pants are not really dressy, but work well for a casual dress down pants if you don't want to wear jeans.  They are very soft and comfortable, but the side zipper on the legs makes them look more casual than dressy.  However, this little zipper changes the entire look of the pants from leggings when zipped up, to yoga pants when unzipped."
4.0,Not crazy about the material but it fits great! And I get so many compliments!
4.0,"I might reorder a smaller size, it would be more comfortable. It is very soft and good looking."
4.0,"Some what large, but once I washed them, it was a perfect fit."
4.0,"Good hat,I like that it's reversible"
4.0,"Cute, but arrived with no Backings attached, not okay."
4.0,"These are fun. I'm glad I expected them to be more like underwear than a costume, because they really aren't like a costume. But they're well made and roomy and, well, fun!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress. My daughter is a bit taller n bigger then most 2 year olds. I ordered a size 5t. Fit her a bit more snug n a bit shorter then I was expecting, but still very adorable on her."
4.0,Sunglasses are fine.  Work as they should.
4.0,"size is adjustable, and quality is good<br />Price is reasonable, and it is comfortable to wear.<br />Pretty nice deal. Gave as a gift to my friend.<br />Bought this product mainly because of color and size."
4.0,"These work good to smooth out tummy for pants, shorts, and skirts. They do not cover enough for a tight dress because you can see the elastic waistline and pantyline through a dress. I just wish the thickness of the elastic ran more throughout the panties."
4.0,"I ordered this Mayabo Dress for my wife.  I ordered a size up thinking it would be made small as some foreign items can be.  The XL, was slightly big but not really noticeably.  She could pull the dress easily over her head without unzipping it.  Overall the dress is made well.  The neckline and sleeves add a delicate touch. The floral pattern on the skirt is quite lovely.<br /><br />The fabric for the skirt is silky and very pretty. However the upper dress is made with a diiferent fabric which has more of a polyester feel to it.  The color is more blue than black as the photo shows.<br /><br />Overall, it's an okay dress, but not really dressy enough to wear to something more dressy than business casual."
4.0,"This has been a great addition for me,  I have issues with clothing, I can't go braless any more so this is my only option.  This fit well and clasped in the center and had no issues there.  What this is, is a sticky cup that sticks to your skin on both breasts. no worries there is a non sticky portion for the very sensitive area.  then the bra clasp together in the center pulling them in and squeezing your girls together.  I really like the way this works and would really be great for certain clothes.  I had no issues with the bra not sticking to my skin and had no issues taking it off either but of course it is a sticker so there is some mild tugging to get it off but not painful.  I am giving 4 stars because I need a lift,  and this just didnt provide it.  Nothing that affects the bra or the construction of it in any sort of way just need some lift and support as my girls like to hang low if you know what I mean.<br />At first I was confused if i could reuse these because after using them they arent as sticky as the first time,  I then read on the page you can wash them with soap and water and the sticky portion rejuvenates.  Well hot dog, so I tried it and  it is true, your sticky comes back.  These come in a see thru case, not the best  of case just a generic case but the bra seems to be well design and gives the apperance that nothing is on.<br />my only complaint is listed above and thats just a personal issue than it is with the mechanics of this bra.<br />I received this item for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using the product myself."
4.0,I wear a 10.5 /11 so ordering the 11 was a good move.  They fit nice and are comfortable.
4.0,"love this, but my bust is too large to fit. i would say if you have a normal bust size, it fits true to size if not it runs small."
4.0,Smaller than mentioned size.  Get one size bigger.
4.0,Purchased this for my wife. Was debating over this product or a competitors. This bag in comparison has feet but is smaller and the inside pockets are lower quality material. Good bag overall but my wife says it's not the best &#34;everyday&#34; bag.
4.0,I’m usually a medium but this time I decided to size up. Glad I did. The large are the perfect medium.
4.0,6-1/2 (My normal size) was a bit roomy but since I will only wear them with heavier socks they do ok. Very comfortable and I got lots of compliments on the looks.
4.0,"Cozy on the inside, durable on the outside especially with its rubber sole ...which also adds some arch support.  Great indoor/outdoor slippers....allows you to walk on your damp lawn in the morning to get your paper without your slippers getting soaked through...or even take you dog for a quick trip around the block.  However I should have heeded the reviews and recommendations  of others and ordered the next size up.  It runs a little small and a little narrow.  I can wear a Womens size 5.5 or 6.  So I figured I should be good with a size 6.  But my feet are slightly wide and I have a bunion on my left foot.  So the 6 is a little too snug and the sides of the slipper rub and irritate the bunion on my left foot. I also think the slippers are a little short too.  Both of my heels seem to ever slightly overlap the outer edge of the back of both slippers....which makes me feel like I should have gotten the next size up for a more comfortable fit.  Unfortuntely, I wore them before realizing this.  So now I am trying to remedy the situation by attempting to stretch out the slippers with shoe stretchers.  So heed my warning and buy a size up if there is any doubt."
4.0,"arrive on time, it is very lovely, like it a lot, the ring is a bit tight though,, I measured it, and is like a 6, so be aware,"
4.0,This top is made from a nice non wrinkly material and the color is a rich deep purple. I also lice the cross  in the neckline.
4.0,Great sun glasses for the price
4.0,"Good quality, fast delivery, no complaints. (i reserve 5 stars for over and above quality and/or service)"
4.0,Outfit was cute and came as pictured.  Runs on the small side - body suit and sleeves were a little short. I ordered a 2T and it fits more like my daughter’s 18 mo clothes (mostly Carter’s). Minnie ears were very durable and held up to my daughter trying to put them on herself.
4.0,"Cute... came with a stone lose, buy glue just in case... Returning them... maintenance free please"
4.0,Very confortable. I am currently pregnant and was a cute top even with a belly
4.0,"Received mine broken upon delivery. The replacement wasn't as nice as the first one. Although the cool carvings are great, the wood is very flimsy and will break. If you're going to give this to a kid, expect it to be broken within two weeks. If you are using it for ritual work, you should be fine if you don't flourish too hard."
4.0,Hat is cute and seems like good quality but it didn’t come with the chin strap which I was really disappointed about.  Would have come in handy to have on windy days at the beach.
4.0,"The color is a little duller than the picture, but it is still such a cute top. My 8 year old loves this shirt!"
4.0,Cute shirt! Was impressed with this. Haven't washed it yet though.
4.0,"The color is olive green, more in the dark shade of greens but really good quality. I’m 140lbs 5’1 with wide and size 8 fit me just right (got mi regular size 6 but was too tight on the hips). Needed to place a pin due to the deep cleavage but work it out well."
4.0,"Overall fit was fine EXCEPT for the outer edge of straps and underarm section...cut in too much and after a couple hours become very uncomfortable. As far doing the job in the chest and admomind area, they worked great. I feel the discomfort I experienced was as much a function of my built as the item itself. I DO recommend them, as they might be fine for someone else. I also recommend that you get the same size as the size T-shirt you wear."
4.0,Beautiful dress! Disappointed to have to return. The sash was much too small for my waist even though the dress fit well.
4.0,Very soft set! It fits too loose for me. Ordered xl but should have ordered large. 5’5” 195 lbs. but will order again in another color though.
4.0,"Great value for locket but the chain is a little cheap, it broke as soon as it got yanked. Good gift"
4.0,its great has lasted me a while now. I currently have one in my bridge piercing. But they aren't on the very long side sadly.
4.0,It is a nice hat. Hipsters will love it .
4.0,"A good looking necklace, I love the purple color !  not real fond of  the braided cord . The colors are beautiful ,but to short & kinda scratchy . That's for me ,I'm highly sensitive to a lot of things.<br /> Thx M.Ferguson."
4.0,"These headbands are great.  They're soft, very absorbent and fit great however, they have an obnoxious odor though and I've ashed them several times."
4.0,This dress my daughter purchased it recently.  It fits well and it garment flows with the wind.
4.0,"Very nice watch. Has kept excellent time. It is bigger than what i usually like,but since it is a skeleton watch,im fine with it. Quality is very good. Sold watch. I have a Kenneth Cole watch and this is comparable."
4.0,I loved this dress. It fits perfectly on the body. Measurements are true to size. The only issue is that if you get it exactly your size than there isn't must ruffles around the shoulder area. So my suggestion is to go one size up if you want the ruffles effect.
4.0,"Very pretty on, stretchy and comfortable to wear. I got so many compliments! Longer than expected."
4.0,"I like the socks. However, I wish they made an extra small size. I wear size 5.5 -6 women's and the s/m are big, especially in the toe area. They are not unusable. I'm going to get a couple more pairs but will have to go with a different brand that carries xs."
4.0,"Milacolato jewelry is usually inexpensive, but the quality is good and it's affordable. When I saw this ring up for request at Vine, I asked for it. This review is for: Milacolato 925 Sterling Silver Ring 18K Gold Plated High Polish Triple Interlocked Rolling Rings Stackable Band Rings for Women.<br /><br />This ring only fits my pinkie finger. It's made of interlocked rings, so you can spin it around and play with it if you're bored waiting somewhere or if you're anxious. It's made of sterling silver, so there should be no adverse reactions or leaving green marks on your skin over time.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a decent ring for the price. We're not talking high end jewelry here, just something that looks nice and provides an outlet for fidgiters."
4.0,"Bought from onlinemarket66. It took about a month to arrive, but came directly from China, so the delay was expected. The one I received was in good shape. It's not a perfect exterior paint job, but nothing like being scratched up or used-looking like other reviewers mentioned. The chain is too short in my opinion, but that can be replaced. The charm/watch is heavier than I expected. The front has a spring hinge so it closes itself.  It was a gift for one of our teens and she really liked it."
4.0,Too big for me but I use it to tie around my waist as an accent to my outfit.
4.0,"I usually like the waffle material that this shirt is made of, but found this material to be thin.  It was really large on me and I usually wear either a large or Xlarge shirt but this shirt was definitely big.  I liked the color (which was gray) and I liked the cross-cut style of the shirt.  I did not really like the waistband in the shirt and also felt like the sleeves were really long as well. Kind of seemed cheaply made to me"
4.0,"I really like this naval ring.  It came in a timely manner and had no defects.  However, it doesn't really open as the description says.  I have no problem with this (what do you do with tiny handcuffs, anyway?), but the seller shouldn't advertise it as such.  Still, it's very cute and serves it's purpose."
4.0,love the color and fabric though it has no compression what so ever . So if you have a pouch that’s not for you.
4.0,This is for a person who doesn't carry a lot of keys (valet) but wants a cool and sturdy key chain. Great product.
4.0,"I ordered an extra small,  the waist fit is as expected but the length is too long"
4.0,Smart but quality of the fabric is very cheap.
4.0,"nice material, good cut"
4.0,"I really like these earrings however the wires are thick and they hurt my ears, so I just replaced the wires and now they are perfect. Perfect light green color, and they are about 1/2 inch in width and length."
4.0,Fits comfortably! I have a fairly average sized head for a woman and it wasn't too big or small. Stays on my head well and looks nice!
4.0,Really warm pajamas. You may want to sleep on top of your covers with these.
4.0,"It's a cool looking bracelet for sure.  But it is way too, tight.  I have other bracelets brand new that are 6.5 and they are not tight like this; cutting off circulation."
4.0,"This bikini is very sexy! I was excited to try it on. However, i ordered a small and I received medium. The top was very big at first but then after adjusting the straps to the shortest, it fit.<br /><br />The panty however fits just right n some would probably say a bit tight.<br /><br />I would definitely go a size up from the usual...  Where the top can be adjusted the bottom cannot.<br /><br />Very sexy!"
4.0,"Inexpensive, non slip sole"
4.0,"The tail is  like Disney quality. It truly makes you feel like a mermaid. I am 6ft tall, so finding something that actually resembles a tail is pretty impressive. The top however, fit my 13 lb cat like a glove. There was no way, even with a jar of ghee and a little Pam, I was getting myself into the purple crop top that comes with it."
4.0,"Bought these for my son who has a wider foot and has special orthotics in his shoes as well. These were great, but even too wide for my son. The heel cup wasn’t deep enough with the orthotics in the shoes and they kept slipping off his heels. We ended up sending these back.<br /><br />On the good side, these were super cute, they looked very well constructed and my guy said they were comfy and didn’t pinch his toes."
4.0,I bought these for my son. They are sturdy and made well. Great price!!@
4.0,Nice but a little too long
4.0,I received this blouse a few days ago. The fabric is very soft. I usually wear a large. It fits well around the chest and waist however I feel it's a little to short.  I would like to see it a little bit longer. I still feel this is a very nice product. I washed it on a gentle cycle and it washed well. Overall I would recommend this product.  Shipping of this product was very slow. I thought it might have gotten lost.<br /><br />This product was provided to me at a discounted price for the purposes of review
4.0,Halloween!! They were awesome!
4.0,"Great wristlet wallet large enough to hold most of my cards. It has two long pockets to hold bills which is great for traveling and carrying multiple currencies. The strap can hook to a clasp or to the zipper. Smells when you first unwrap it, I've had mine about a week and the smell is starting to dissipate."
4.0,Worth the purchase. Glad I bought 2 packs.
4.0,"The dress was very nicely done. There was however sweat stains in the armpits of the dress. I ordered the dress to big on purpose so that it would be sure to fit, and that was a good choice, I can have it taken in easy enough. I will have the dress cleaned when it is at the tailors. Besides those stains that are not noticeable from the outside of the dress, it was very nicely done. The slow arrival was not unexpected due to current issues slowing mail down everywhere. I am not unhappy about the purchase at all."
4.0,Very cute 💋
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised at how well this bra fit and worked.  I wear a 38D a exercise bra would normally mash you flat or offer no support.  I am able to run in this bra.
4.0,"I have not had the chance to use this outdoors yet, but from what I can tell after putting it on and cinching up the draw cord around the face area, it is very warm and comfortable. The outside fabric appears to have some water repellant properties."
4.0,This product is a bit on the spendy side but it works great for protecting my hats.
4.0,"Bead count is wrong,  but it works fine for meditation and fashion purposes. Sturdy."
4.0,"Awesome ring for the price. I ordered 2 more for my daughters, they were so nice.  Great price and they came on time."
4.0,"I ""hope"" the painted-on AT logo survives a wash....or 6"
4.0,Someone with real gauges complimented me on these. There is a rubber piece around the ends that comes off that I don’t think is supposed to happen. I only wore these once in a while but they held up in looks. I’d order more.
4.0,"Exactly what I ordered. My son didn't like the mesh or leaf designs, so I just cut them off the cuffs and he didn't wear the mesh overlay."
4.0,The fit was just at the level of my waist it may shrink after first wash
4.0,Wonder for the holidays
4.0,I would suggest sizing up the fit is a little small and snug but other than that it looks just as expected. I would definitely recommend to others for a cute fall state that piece.
4.0,"Was so excited to get this in, but it was a bit to small for me, as I usually wear a L/XL. Give it o one of my sons, so it wasn’t a loss, except for my disappointment. Ordered the other style hats that are two colored, and they fit better."
4.0,"This beanie fits great (slouchy fit) and was exactly what I was looking for.  It is the perfect length, neither too long nor too short.  I also like the pattern of the material as well.  It is pretty light although it would probably be a little warm to wear other than in fall, winter, or early spring.  The only concern I have is the quality of the material as it doesn't feel as durable as I would like thus the 4-star rating.  Overall, as long as you handle it with care it seems like a winner.  I am planning on ordering another color to have for the next fall/winter season."
4.0,Super cute but does run a bit on the smaller size. I would go a size up.
4.0,Es un piquito pequeño pero para el precio esta bien
4.0,Use these dyes all the time and they function very well. Nice addition to my watch press
4.0,This is absolutely perfect. The chain broke within a week but we just got a stainless steel replacement on Amazon too. The tag and wrist band is great quality though and we will order again if/when needed.
4.0,"Love design and very comfortable. However, runs a bit small."
4.0,PENDANT CHARM IS CUTE; THE CHAIN IS FLIMSY. It is worth the $16.50 lightning deal price.
4.0,Love it--beautifully made and very comfortable.
4.0,"I wanted a durable, zip top bag to carry &#34;dog stuff&#34; on a car trip cross country.  This bag had plenty of room for canned food, dishes, brush, and toys.  I wouldn't call it &#34;luggage,&#34; but it served the purpose.  This came as a two-pack,and I still haven't used the other bag.  Would be handy as a resusable grocerty bag, too."
4.0,Great size. Fits my 10 month old and I think it would easily stretch to fit older children as the stock photo shows. Seems to be comfortable as well. So far they don't seem to slip down or back too bad.
4.0,"I purchased these to wear as part of a costume. They looked cute, but they were very tight on my calves. If you have muscular calves, you may want to pick different socks."
4.0,My son loves his watch easy to put on and take off. Gave 4 stars cause he says the band is itchy.
4.0,Cute lined hat for those cold mornings.
4.0,"If you can fall in to the right size, this is a great costume piece. Sadly, at 5' 10"" with a 33"" waist I'm too short and a tad small for the XL and too tall for the L, but the L fits my chest and torso about perfectly (could get it altered, but I'd need the right fabric)."
4.0,Very nice looking and comfortable. Fit well really like the added pockets
4.0,Overall happy with the finished product. My  complaint(s) is I wished the necklace was better quality and a more secure clasp was added. Other than that. I adore it!☺
4.0,The clip-on mechanism is solid and works well.  The yellow lens are somewhat light but work. And the size of the lens perfectly fits my glasses
4.0,"Nice, a little big, but my son will grow into it."
4.0,It is an inexpensive belt that looks stylish h
4.0,Fast shipping. Exactly what I wanted.
4.0,"My wife's review - Great dress for special occasions (like Independence Day).  I normally wear a small (5'5&#34;/135 lbs) but I ordered a medium because I like loose fitting clothing and kept it  The empire waist fits a little loose on me, but not enough to go through the hassle of an exchange.  Also had no cleavage showing.  It's not an expensive dress so even though the seams are a little off, I wore it July 4th and still got compliments.  The blue on top is darker (more navy) than pictured.  Overall, good for the price."
4.0,"These pins are cute but much larger than I expected and heavy! I'm a high school science teacher so am always on the look out for pins, stickers, and other accessories for my classroom. The molecule on one of the pins (C8H8O3) is vanillin (which seems like a random choice), but fun to have on my bulletin board all the same."
4.0,"It fit as I expected, but I took it in a bit and added a belt. I'm very happy with it."
4.0,Overall they’re very comfortable. They’re very shiny and stretchy but the tummy control is very thick and much less likely to stretch. I found them to be a bit big on me and I can usually wear size small so if in between definitely size down.
4.0,"Great strap for my sunglasses. At first it was a bit tough to put then on my sunglasses, i have a pair of Costas Hamlin, but at the end they fit fine and very secure. Good product. Very stylish"
4.0,"I really do love the shirt! I normally wear a medium, however, would have preferred a large. The medium was too form fitted, whereas I would have preferred a little looser look in the arms & waist. Overall, nice shirt. looks great to dress up or down"
4.0,"My wife love it a lot.<br />One thing disappointing is the zipper, it commonly stuck in the middle, not going all smoothly. bummer."
4.0,"I am in a love hate relationship with this dress. It fits well. It is comfortable. I can move in it and the material is just comfortable. But, those sleeves are weird. I don't hate them, if I did I wouldn't have bought it to begin with but they take some getting use to. Also, this comfortable dress....which I got in black.... is see through in the skirt. Now I have to add layers making the dress not as comfortable. But it is still comfortable enough that I kept it."
4.0,Believe they are correct type but very difficult for me to get on. Will try ordering with less compression.
4.0,Great product...I love how it can fold up smaller to fit in my glove box or into another bag for storage. I took it camping with me and it held a lot of things...my clothes and toiletries. I would recommend buying this for people that are active and need something to carry their things.
4.0,I love them boots but only the material of the boots tears easy
4.0,"Saving for a granddaughter!!! Very tiny. However, it’s very pretty."
4.0,"Funny rounded toe shape and one spot of blister friction but once worn in, really good support. Comfortable for walking miles."
4.0,Just a little bit loose for me.. but I loved it. Im Small but I had to buy XS.. great color and quality.
4.0,The fabric is super nice and soft. My daughter loved it. Fabulous.
4.0,A very cute apron. Pockets are nice to have too!
4.0,"The material is a bit too thin for my taste, and the shirt's a bit shapeless, but I love the color and the studs on the shoulders. Super cute."
4.0,Color.. The fit
4.0,Cute for child sized glasses. Very small.
4.0,Cute but tiny.  For people that love delicate necklace this would be awesome for you.  I tend to like chunkier necklaces.  But still a lovely Easter inspired jewelry.
4.0,"The dress is good quality...but it was larger than I expected. I ordered a large-I'm 5'7&#34; and around 170 pounds.  I typically wear a size 10 in dresses-. I'm a C cup and have somewhat of an hourglass shape with a bigger booty.  I'd recommend sizing down. Also, I thought this one had an attached belt and it does not.  But great dress for the price."
4.0,"A bit big, made for taller people, super cute though!"
4.0,It is a nice dress. Fits well. The Material is too thin.
4.0,"Comfortable and like the style, but because of the material it got confused as a pajama top."
4.0,Pretty. Gold part does not look as gold as the picture.
4.0,Very well made and delicate
4.0,It really works but not durable can't use for any sports or anything active works best stationary television or reading nothing that involves ton of motion can't survive a lot of Falls but does work
4.0,It needs to fit on wider visors. Also it would be nice to be wider to block on the sides
4.0,These bands fit just perfectly just like the original. I just wish they had more than 2 colors to choose from and that instead of bundling they gave you a choice.  I already had a purple one but I had to buy the purple to get the black.
4.0,It's very bulky but well made and hold a lot.
4.0,"Just the glitz and glamour for quiet or loud places. The long delivery time frame is not unrealistic, it came on next to last day. Each one wrapped snuggly in clear plastic -  hard to give a hands-on look for any flaws before wrapping them. Minor missing connect rings easily fixed with tweezers and things. iI split the variety for different taste gifts. They are great costume fun jewelry. You need an extra set of hands to get a few on and off safely. Lots of compliments for &#34;ear fashions&#34; someone called them."
4.0,I thought they would be to small but with the strength the fit perfect.
4.0,"I love the outfit, it's cute I would by it again just with a size up for the top every time I put my hands up it goes up way to high."
4.0,Rucksack carries everything needed. Good surprise is that it can carry more than I thought.
4.0,"Compared to other products, it's affordable and it does the job.  This is something that's not going to be comfortable at first, so set that as your expectation."
4.0,"This sweater is soft! I purchased the grey, and it’s not see-through like I expected. The quality is better than expected but not exceptional. Definitely going to wash it on the gentle cycle. It’s kinda short around the bottom but with it styled off the shoulder, it’s not an issue. For the price, it’s a great sweater!"
4.0,"Just a little thin, but very flattering."
4.0,Very nice hat looks authentic enough and soft to touch. Would buy it again.<br />Better than what I have seen in the Caribbeans...
4.0,These are handy but I wish they had grippers on them
4.0,"It's a nice pendant, but you wouldn't fool anyone if you put it in a Tiffany box. My miniature niece absolutely loved it."
4.0,One strap arrived with a a slightly too short quick release mechanism which would disconnect and then my watch would fall off. Thankfully they include a couple spares and those were correctly sized so it wasn't a permanent issue.
4.0,"I keep a lot of papers and two check record keeping booklets in this and I find it a little thin. If you keep only the bare essentials in it, should be fine.  Update, I have used it for a while now and it has stretched a bit. I am now happier with it."
4.0,"Bought this to wear for my friend's wedding. It's a little large for my wrist, but I think a small would be too tight. Arrived early. Very pleased."
4.0,cool shirt - material is a little stiff
4.0,"These look and feel great. Optics are excellent, my only criticism is that I wish they didn't say ""boom"" on the sides so prominently."
4.0,Love the color. Wanted something to wear with jeans and this fits the bill.
4.0,Good sun protection and I appreciate the chin straps as large brim hats tend to fly off with even a slight breeze. I added those plastic sliding grips to the straps as I find them to be more secure than riding a bow. I use one on the inside of the hat to tighten as it large on me and one on the inside chin strap to hold the hat on it if is breezy.  By using 2 I can easily switch which side of the hat is on the outside.
4.0,"Bought this for cosplay purposes. It can be a bit of a struggle to get on but I got the hang of it after a few tries. It doesn't make me as flat as I would like, but I am rather small (5ft, 100lbs) and wear a 32D so I wasn't expecting it to completely solve the problem. One thing I would say is that it is very warm. It goes past my hips a little bit so the shirt is long but again, I am small. The texture is a bit odd (It's a very fine mesh) but not too terrible. It is more rough but on the front section there is a second layer underneath that is a lot softer.<br />Follow the size chart closely! I'm usually one to get a size lower but this time I followed the chart and chose to get a Small which was a very wise choice because I don't know if an XS would've even fit over my shoulders.<br />All in all, it's decent and shouldn't be too noticeable under shirts."
4.0,"good watch for the price, does its job,"
4.0,"Pro:  Fit well<br />  Quality cut and sewn<br />  Cotton<br />Con: Plastic Zipper<br />This is the first time I ever bought any thing by GV without a metal zipper. So they get a 4 star, love them other than that."
4.0,"They look a lot different in the ear than the pictures show… they still look good and feel solid but I’m sure you could find something just as cool if not cooler, for cheaper"
4.0,There are a good variety of bracelets and in different colors. They shipped pretty quickly. They are not the best quality so some have broken but I always another one to switch it out with.
4.0,Liked it but ran big ordered the small I wear size 28 jeans had to use the last loop they should make an extra small other than that great
4.0,These are very nice for the price. Perfect for homemade jewelry.
4.0,"material is cool, but collar is a bit wide."
4.0,"Very cute<br />Slightly tight, but loosen a bit after wearing for some time<br />I thought it was weird that the pegs that attach the band to the watch were free floating - but not an issue once attached to the watch"
4.0,"Wearing to my daughter's wedding.  I bought it a little large to fit my bottom half knowing that it would be a big on top.  But since the price was so great, I had it altered."
4.0,Got a pair for my father (former pilot) and my son. They love it.Hard to find aircraft that my Dad used to pilot.
4.0,"So far they've lasted multiple washes and hold their ground. They're also comfortable and don't slip off. Moreover, these held up better than some alternatives on Amazon in that they absorb more sweat(my feet sweat a lot, trust me), are more snug, and durable.<br /><br />However, I do wish they were a bit larger as I have size 12 feet and its size is pushing my toes through the front after a bit of wear."
4.0,"Beautiful ring, I love it. I get a lot of compliments, and it is a very artistic ring."
4.0,My kid got this as a birthday outfit and loves it. It would not fit anyone above a US size Small.
4.0,"Very nice material, only compliant is that the waste band is a little awkward if you have bigger boobs. That being said I'm still really happy with it."
4.0,"These aren't really heavy duty, but &#34;heavier&#34; duty then those cheap plastic ones. If your looking for a small low profile belt badge reel that is nicer than plastic, these are for you"
4.0,"These definitely run small, but feel really good on. The colors are vibrant and have not faded in the wash. I will buy more prints."
4.0,"Decent looking ring, nice design and weight.  The detail is a little off on this one, I have purchased many rings from Jinique and they usually possess a much keener eye to detail.  Not a bad piece really, just a little rough as far design execution, then again, for the price you can't complain.  I'd buy another one if I lost this one to replace it, still a good ring just nit picking."
4.0,So far so good. Not broken yet with 4.5yo and 2.5yo boys. Fits the 4.5yo well.
4.0,Fit is loose but has a bit of shape.  This can go casual or dressed up.
4.0,"Allthough these run a half size small they still fit my baby girl with no problems she just won't be able to wear them a little longer than I thought because of the sizing, so if your child is a 5, get her the 6 that way she has a little more growing room. Othere than that there have been no rubs on skin or tight fitting aches. She doesn't seem to complain or show that they bother her and I also got her to red side button boots which are ADORABLE and comfy. These shoes have the softest leather."
4.0,The quality of the bag is ok
4.0,"I love the look of this and it's nice quality! I wore it to a wedding this weekend over my favorite lbd and got many compliments! Only issues are that the shoulders are a bit off and land in a weird spot and it's not exactly a perfect fit for women with a large chest. But I love it, so I will make it work."
4.0,"But the neck V it is too long, but I can fix it. Thanks,"
4.0,"Fits well, but not overly comfortable to sleep in. The material is just a little uncomfortable."
4.0,Dress was exactly as described. It is very well made. My only disappointment was in the delivery time it was not delivered as promised and it was for New Year's Eve so that was very disappointing. The dress itself was amazing
4.0,I purchased the shirt a little bigger because I wanted the shirt to last my 12 yr old for at least a year. But it fits good and my son absolutely loves it.
4.0,Material seems a little different than pictured.  Though comfortable it doesnt appear as free flowing as the wpman pictured. The size im. Wearing is small. This is work appropriate not itchy
4.0,"I think these are a good size and have been comfortable so far. The backs are very small though and difficult to get on straight. I think I'm going to swap out for different backs. Otherwise, the earrings themselves are good.<br /><br />Edit: I kept the small backs on the posts and they're working well. The small backs are better if you want to sleep in these earrings."
4.0,"A little short, but if I wear it with tights it looks nice! Wore it to a work event and looked great."
4.0,These fit a little small compared to sizing chart. I went a size up and they look good.
4.0,Great earrings...very pretty...a little larger than I expected but I have received numerous compliments when so wear them.
4.0,It's very thin. I wish it had some sort of lining or removable pads.
4.0,Super soft and warm and comfortable! Makes it hard to wear slippers while wearing the socks but that’s OK the socks were warm enough not to need slippers. I really do like the socks
4.0,Like everything about this shirt expect the fact that it collects every spec and fleck of dust.
4.0,Very nice but too small for a dress
4.0,"After removed extra threads inside, it Is not bad now"
4.0,Not 5 stars as it wrinkles very easily
4.0,"No complaints really, I wish the material was slightly different, more cotton feel, but I understand it had to be that way for moisture purposes. I’d buy again"
4.0,"I love the color & fit. Not much coverage above your eyes, but still, not bad for price."
4.0,Over all I liked them! They're super cute and feel good! They for great and they are sturdy. They don't feel cheap but they don't feel as durable as really expensive sunglasses could be. The tint is a little light on the mirrored ones. I almost wish it was tinted darker but it stil reflects the sun good and overall does the job nicely! I would buy these again in black!
4.0,I ordered this dress in a size larger than my normal size because I read the reviews. The reviewers all suggested going up a size. However I found that the next size was too big for me.  I sent it back &amp; ordered my regular size &amp; the fit is almost perfect. The only problem is that it is still a bit large at the armholes.  Several people mentioned this but I’m keeping this size because I will be able to take it in myself to correct the fit.
4.0,Very cute and great price for this product.
4.0,The square stone/gem is a little off center but I have gotten compliments on it for sure!
4.0,"I enjoy this product very much, however because for the size if the chain making it difficult to put on I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,Tank was exactly as pictured
4.0,My only complaint about this strap is the hardware connectors could be smaller.
4.0,This bag worked well for NFL game.  I just wish the zipper was on the top instead of the side.
4.0,"my zipper was on left side, im use to it being on the right as a man."
4.0,Looks and fits just as pictured and my head I would say is a bit bigger than average :)
4.0,"One of the little white pearls fell off after about a week from one of them,  but they are really cute and work well.  Good for the price:)"
4.0,Use as a workout bag. Roomy and has lots of compartments/pockets. Only issue is with the yoga mat straps....needed to use something to pull them up while not in use to hold a yoga mat.
4.0,I’m between sizes so I could have a little more fullness in the top. I like its comfortabilty & easy care.
4.0,"Arrived quickly, good quality, but believe what hey say about ordering a size or two larger."
4.0,These are slightly larger than expected but it worked out for me other than the posts are a bit too long for my taste
4.0,itchy but great for price
4.0,It's the perfect size and I also like the carmel like color. It has two pockets for cell and keys a side zipper for incidentals a large center divider zipper pouch and lots of room on each side of the center divider. It also feels good to the touch. This is my first experience with this brand.
4.0,"This jacket is surprisingly nice for its price! Quality made and very comfortable. Planning on getting the black one too.<br />Unfortunately, I had to return and exchange for another size. I normally wear a large in jackets and this was way too big on me. The sleeves are especially baggy. I would recommend purchasing this in a size down."
4.0,"Definitely ample sized and lightweight, this is a cute (buttery yellow) boxy fit parka that is actually lined! There is no real 'fit' to it so it should do well over bulkier tops like sweaters. This one appeared to be used - the string in the hood was missing and there were some subtle spots on it, including a pen mark on the hood. I just used an extra shoelace for the hood and spot cleaned the ink off. Haven't had it out in the rain to test yet. It's pretty wrinkled and will definitely get moreso with packing, but I'm not worried about how I'll look in it in a dounpour! At this price, its worth it."
4.0,I gave this as a Christmas present. My friend’s grandson loves it. He sent me a picture of him wearing it.
4.0,"nice fit, little low cut for me"
4.0,Nice little gift for three best friends
4.0,Beautiful nightie. I hope the lace holds up. If your arms are fat the sleeves may be tight.
4.0,I love them when I can find them.
4.0,Perfect would buy again
4.0,"I'm a petite girl, but I've got a disproportionatly large bum and this was the tights downfall. They ripped up the backside the first time I tried them on. It's probably my fault for not checking the sizing. Most Asian sized things usually fit me since I'm so small, but I usually get skirts and dresses and tops. I've learned my lesson! The tights are super cute though and I wore them regardless with shorts on top. Got lots of compliments."
4.0,It's a cute keychain but probably a bit overpriced. But it does look exactly like the pic. I do recommend this.
4.0,"Very beautiful ring. The authentic rose gold, look is perfect!"
4.0,It's beautiful. But unfortunately it's a bit large for my hands😂.
4.0,Inexpensive but the color wear off very quickly
4.0,A little thin but overall nice jacket
4.0,You have to figure out how to adjust the length of the belt w/o instrutions.
4.0,"Looks on the purple side in the picture, but is truly a blue. Quality was good for the price."
4.0,"Very cute color, fit perfectly..true to size.  Cute style but too short for my build.  I was hoping for something at the knee.  I'm 5'6&#34; and it fell mid thigh."
4.0,I love this dress. It fit just as I thought it would. I bought it for church and it stops right below my knees so it was perfect.
4.0,"Cool, just comes a bit to big"
4.0,Very comfortable. Looks cute after two months started to get those round balls on the top part.
4.0,comfy good for the price..
4.0,Super cute 1st Easter outfit. Onesie was a little big.  Be careful Some of the little sequins can come off.
4.0,I wasn’t sure about ordering clothes online but everything I bought in this order fit exactly like I expected I was very happy
4.0,"this thing is useful.. that's it.  it won't change your life.  i used to throw a bunch of chargers, cords, etc etc in my bookbag when i went on trips, now i GRID-IT, which saves me about 3 seconds of digging around in my bag.  i guess my stuff is a little more protected now, so that's good.  i sound pretty unenthusiastic, but this thing is useful.  i'd recommend it if you think it'd be useful to you.  it pretty much does exactly what it looks like it does, i don't know that reviews will help you here.<br /><br />oh but check this out, there's a zipper on the back, so you can maybe store some receipts or flat objects.  maybe you didn't know that by looking at the picture.  it's not a great zipper pocket, but it'll do in a pinch."
4.0,They would have been great but ran too small. Had to send back.
4.0,"These looked like they would fit well, but after one wash they shunk up a bit and now fit closer to running tights than sweatpants.  I acknowledge my thighs are a bit bigger than the average hipster (because I do squats), so that may be it -- but they were certainly not as baggy as they appear in the photos here (unless that model has toothpicks for legs)"
4.0,Looks good. Super warm.  But check out my photo? This company can’t even spell their label right!!!
4.0,Had one to arrive broken other than that they are cute.
4.0,"Lights flash in all the color and it works great however, one of the plastic stud pieces came unloose before I even used it."
4.0,It was for a Hanukkah party very nice pjs
4.0,"I love this owl-neck long sleeve tee. It can't really be called a sweatshirt because it is a thin material. I love the kangaroo pocket and the cowl neck is flattering. Only reason it didn't get all 5 stars from me is because of sizing. I did read the other reviews, so despite the fact that I wear a S/M I ordered an XL. It did fit, but those of you with a large bust can forget it. The material has no stretch and I could see it ripping easily."
4.0,I would give it to someone for a gift  it's a good bracelet quality value for the cost.
4.0,The zippers on front are just for decoration so don't unzip.  I was afraid that the zippers were going to either break or not close. It's more Royal than Navy.
4.0,looks great good price love it
4.0,"Comfortable, good bargains"
4.0,It was just too small for me.
4.0,Decent shoe
4.0,Just as advertised. Looks great !!!!
4.0,Material is good but size is not correct. Go for 1 size bigger for waist
4.0,Cute but could be fuller. Still was a better alternative to making one although it needs to be aired out because of its packaging. Labeling this item as prime 2 day shipping is misleading as it took 4 days.
4.0,Beautiful dress... very light ... kinda see through .. but can wear a slip
4.0,"Really good construction and would be very comfortable if they came in a wide width. I really hope they do expand their width selection, then it would be a 5 star rating."
4.0,"A little small for the size specified, but my granddaughter loved it."
4.0,Do not buy in lighter colour if you sweat.. It will show as dark wet patches under arm.<br />Very cute. Very short.
4.0,The shirt fit everywhere in length and body but the arm were so skinny that there no way I can wear it I tried it was so uncomfortable on my arms I am going to have to give it to goodwill and hope that someone out there has skinny arms and I didn't want to send it back and have to pay shipping and lose money they have to make these clothes to do Chinese women they are more petit than Americans I only weigh 115 lbs and 5foot4 increase can't imagine why them arms are so skinny oh well lesson learned
4.0,I like the product but the sizes run much smaller than expected.
4.0,Fits perfectly.  Nice martial for spring and summer
4.0,"Took awhile to get since it comes from China.  It says it's cotton material, it's more like polyester material. It's very comfortable though and the sleeves are very nicely done. I usually wear a medium and ordered a medium so I think it fits as expected."
4.0,"I ordered three pairs of these. They are just beautiful! Two were just fine, and one would not close appropriately. Still, no one but you will know that these are cheap earrings. They look amazing, and sparkle appropriately. You can't tell that they are fake at all! Even my mom loved them.<br /><br />I would buy them again!<br /><br />Full Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,This beanie is so cute and I love the lights.  Only doing 4 stars because I wish it had a true pouch or sewn holder for the power pack.  It tends to move all around the base of the hat and is sometimes hard to find to turn on and off because of it.
4.0,It looks great!<br />The only thing is that the pin is very bendable and crooked and doesn't poke through the other part of the earring well enough to hold it on your ear when doing everyday things. The other part with the hole also doesn't seem tight enough to hold the pin either.
4.0,It's a very beautiful skirt . I purchase a medium it's a little small but I like it . I will order different color
4.0,"I thought these are fun for an extra little gift. These are &#34;disposable&#34; glasses. They are cute and fun, but they are delicate and can come apart. Easy to put back together and the kids enjoyed them"
4.0,"I’m 5’2 and 155 pounds and I ordered a small/medium, I love these leggings they’re one of my favorites! Only reason why I gave it one less star is because they came with a pulled thread"
4.0,"Gorgeous dress!! Perfect for a night at the beach. The small slip underneath is super short, but I am just gonna wear a dark tight slip under."
4.0,"Overall I love the shirt!  I do find the fabric to be a bit thick and a little scratchy but I'm hoping with a few washes that will improve. Again, overall very happy. :)"
4.0,"A lot bigger than expected, still cute & good quality though."
4.0,My son doesn't have a high instep but I feel those shoes are a bit small in that area. I have to pull the velcro harder than other shoes.
4.0,"Nice , just a little tight."
4.0,Worked as a swimsuit cover.  ok.
4.0,Arrived on time. As expected.
4.0,Cute and worked for what we needed but it's on the smaller side for my smaller-side-of-average 7 year old.
4.0,"This is a really cute necklace.  It's not fancy, but it's pretty.  It's perfect for a young teen or pre-teen."
4.0,"Though I do love this hoodie, it's a bit shorter than I expected. Being on the shorter side, I expected it to be way longer than it is. I feel like if i was of average height it might be a bit too short."
4.0,"Love this suit, it was just WAY too small and had to send it back! I'm a 34DD, 27, 34 and normally wear a small or size 3."
4.0,"It's pretty heavy and a little awkward, but still fits. Just be careful with it is what I suggest. I still kinda like it"
4.0,"The guys at work said it gives me that Clint Eastwood look, but it looks much better on my wife."
4.0,"Great dress for the vertically challenged! Fabric is soft, stretchy, and comfortable. Color payoff matches the item’s description. Slightly transparent in the bust area, but I plan on wearing a white crop top underneath."
4.0,"These are actually super cool looking, just like the picture.  However, the side blinders make it very hard to use your peripheral vision."
4.0,"The off the shoulder top was ok as far length<br /> Is good , Didn’t like material and arm were to tight  for me , going  to keep it cause maybe a chilling night it’s  would be good  still a nice top"
4.0,I like it. Rather small sized. Would probably work out for either a man or a woman.  Quality seems decent.
4.0,Very comfortable except the stitching in the waist band is scratchy and irritating. It may soften after repeated washings.
4.0,"Loved the size and the pattern of the print, however, the inside was so black that it would make it very difficult to find anything. I do not have the best eyesight so I need all the help I can get. Staring into total blackness does not help. Unfortunately I sent it back."
4.0,I am having a problem with the stand it is not folding ..
4.0,Too small…
4.0,Sleeves are a bit too long but overall a great dress
4.0,"These are nice but don't seem to be that low rise, seem kind of high waist so loses a star for that but the nice jeans."
4.0,Very comfortable. Seems a bit small in the heel.
4.0,"Very cute,  but it tends to get twisted up."
4.0,"A little lighter weight than I had hoped for.  Grandson liked and will grow into or his mom will wash in hot water the first time for a better fit. Looks good and Grandson was very happy; so, overall I'm happy too."
4.0,I bought this for my husband for Father's Day. It's nice just too expensive.
4.0,love the necklace just wish It would have come in different packaging.
4.0,"""  The items did arrive safely..I am very please with items. So please brought one for my mom and another coach.  """
4.0,"I bought this as a hair buff to wear to protect my curls while I'm sleeping, however, it doesn't stay on during the night.  There's nothing wrong with the headband and if I were using it for another purpose, I'm sure it'd be great.  I just toss and turn too much during the night for this to stay on my head to protect my hair."
4.0,Son loves it. Hope it lasts. After we got a working power pack it does the job. Hopefully its quality and lasts a long time.
4.0,Good quality but the size doesn't fit because is smaller than the normal size
4.0,"Size was a little smaller than expected, but still fit.  Exactly what I was looking for"
4.0,"Nice product, dosent come up to much. Nice material."
4.0,"This is lovely. The bust used to display it is narrow, making the butterfly appear bigger than it is. There is an odor coming from the leather cords. However, they are leather and some odor would be normal.I hope it will dissipate. It is much prettier in person! I recommend it!"
4.0,"Back pocket is an odd shape and is, for me,<br />Not usable as I would expect. But pants fit fine and are comfortable. Should be good good for travel."
4.0,"Nice dress, too long as I expected. With the lace the way it is would be hard to shorten."
4.0,"I am 5'9"", weight 130, long arms, on thin side.  Large fit perfect around the body, arms a little short-remedy, push them up.  Look at the model in the picture.  I am huge compared to her waif like stance, I knew a large would fit.  Have not washed it yet, received many complements.  It is not a heavy material and it clings to the body."
4.0,"I love the color and ordered a size larger than normal since I couldn't try them on first. They fit fine but are a bit too long. That's easy enough to fix, though. Very comfortable which is just what I wanted."
4.0,"I really, really wanted to love these. I got a size small.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Once on, they are comfortable, loose in the legs, lil snug when squatting - like a stiff pair of jeans.<br />Stretchy waistband! So nice. The front pockets are huge! I can actually put my phone in the front pocket, why isn't this more common for girls jeans?<br /><br />Cons: They are so hard to get up over my hips. They aren't stretchy enough in the waist. If you have narrower hips this probably wouldn't be an issue. This is the main reason I'm returning them. I also feel like they arent super flattering in the butt.<br /><br />The pictures of these make them seem like a lighter weight pair of pants, these are not. The fabric is pretty thick so they don't lay like on the model. But I feel like they would hold up well over time."
4.0,"The socks fit well, but could use more cushioning."
4.0,I like the fitness and comfort.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:18695377550024c3c8a07b5da4865cb0]] I did a review on the necklace portion previously, I fell in LOVE with these pieces back in 2010. I have been buying them Ever since. Look Great with anything you put on Sturdy and Great Quality. I just wish they came as a Set like they used to :-/"
4.0,"I bought this to help revive a pair of white boots for my dancer. The product was wrapped in bubble wrap, and the brush and cloth were also packaged nicely. However, the bubble wrap didn't do it's job and the plastic lid was broken when I opened it.  I used it on a pair of really worn boots, we must have at least been owner number 3. It covered the worn spots well enough that the boots will look white from stage. I will continue to use the jar I have until it dries out due to the broken lid."
4.0,"She really liked it, thought it clever!"
4.0,"This glasses were pretty nice, have a little weight to them that I like, I got the gold ones and they are pretty nice. For me could be a little bigger but than again I just have a big head."
4.0,for a better fitted look i should have bought my real size.  But love the dress
4.0,"I really, really liked this dress but I wanted something just above the knee and it was shorter; more like mid thigh. For reference, I’m 5’7” and 146 lbs. Drats!"
4.0,"These are lightweight, sparkly, and, a great accessory to liven up a night look or to add to a Halloween costume. Be careful when you first put them on, I almost broke off the arm because these are so delicate."
4.0,"Soft, good length"
4.0,"Nice fitting, comfortable and love the packaging."
4.0,"It is simple, cute, and seems like it will hold up for future costume use.  However, the fit is kinda small.  I wear a hat size 7 and the hat is just a tad too small.  It will sit on my head (and look adorable) but any light breeze would blow it away.  I may consider adding a chin strap so that I don't spend all my time chasing the hat."
4.0,"Good, small watch. Provides the utilities I need, time, date, alarm, even stopwatch. A problem I have with the strap, maybe it's just my wrists, is that when you pay attention to it, it may feel uncomfortable, but while I'm going through my day I usually don't pay much attention to my wrist except to check the time once in a while."
4.0,I bought these for my ole man to wear this christmas he loves them except the fact that they are fleece and super hot.
4.0,I like the chuckiness of the necklace and earrings are lovely!!
4.0,Smaller than expected but alas it does have a paw print so it has to be awesome.  It is very comfortable.  I have worn it since I received it and it has stayed true.  I would highly recommend.
4.0,"Very nice band! I ordered the rose color and mine is way lighter in person than what the picture online showed, that's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, it's a very nice and durable band. Would buy again!"
4.0,"Great Socks, warm thick but not too thick"
4.0,Nice material and stuff. Liked it.
4.0,Purchase several as gifts. All users said they found it comfortable and form-fitting but not too snug.
4.0,Foot fits great but the sock tube is way tight and not stretchy so the 3.5 yr old (tall and skinny 5T) won't put them on or off herself...
4.0,It’s thick and too tough for yoga or fitness. It’s more something I would sleep in.
4.0,Favorite sweatshirt. . .washes great. . .warm and cozy.  He always asks for this sweatshirt.  Great value and must for his closet.
4.0,Buena calidad de tela pero el talle es grande
4.0,Kind of tight fitting. But I loved the material. Super soft. Go Cubs!
4.0,"This is a purse and it asked me questions as if it were a pair of shoes. The purse is REALLY cute, but it's not very big and isn't pocket friendly. But, &#60;3 it anyway because it's Harry Potter!!!"
4.0,This is too long for small wrists. Would have given 5 stars if it fit. Recommend for those with larger wrists.
4.0,"So I bought this product to apply to a few hats. That I would rather keep looking good. However I have yet to put any of them in a situation where they could potentially become stained or, rained upon. So my rating is currently based on the price tag, scent, and 2 coat requirement for this product and not it's actual effectiveness."
4.0,"Received item as promised, seems to be working, neck and shoulders not aching as much."
4.0,"Looks nice, grippy fabric so it should stay secure in your pocket. Thin but appears sturdy and should hold up for awhile (always end up expecting to replace a wallet every couple of years)"
4.0,"Zippers to open bag are too short, have to fiddle to find them and bag gets out of shape (leans to one side)."
4.0,"Was a but small, but still worked well! The fabrics were thick, and held up well!"
4.0,Like the wallet except wish the area on inside was a little larger.
4.0,"Love the material.  Very stretchy, material is not too thin.  Only potential drawbacks are 1.  that the split is VERY high.  If you have hips that make your skirts draw up or a high butt you may have a problem.  2.  The dress came with a belt which I love, however, it has no belt loops.  The end of the belt lays flat for now but I'm concerned that after while the end will start hanging.<br /><br />The cons don't outweigh the pros so I'm keeping it."
4.0,"I had to order this dress twice because the first time I was sent the wrong dress. That was frustrating but I am SO glad I tried again because it's a great little white dress. Getting married in a courthouse and wanted something cheap, but cute and this is perfect. Of the 3 dresses I ordered and the 4 I received (since one was the wrong one)...this is by far the best and I am very happy with it. It's lined...but the lining is still a little see through with dark stuff underneath...flesh colored undergarments couldn't be seen underneath. I love that the lining goes all the way to the top because it means I can wear a normal bra underneath. Is it a top quality dress...no. There are some loose threads hanging but those were easily trimmed and now it looks just fine. Very happy overall with this dress after receiving the correct one. I am 5ft tall and 145 pounds (mostly in the chest and belly) and I ordered a large and it's perfect. I don't think a medium would have fit my bust so I am glad a went with the bigger size...this is perfect."
4.0,So far good product stands up to DR. M's rep. But time will tell.
4.0,Nice glasses with a few neat extras!!
4.0,"Comfy and cute, but definitely on the small side!! It’s also a polyester blend so expect to get a little static, but its still very breathable. My only complaints are that it ran so small and that you can tell the front from the back on the shorts!"
4.0,"I really like this top.  Fits true to size, lightweight, but not clingy or too thin.  Very soft.  Would definitely recommend."
4.0,They were way too big for my face also I felt like they were a little flimsy but I love the look of them.
4.0,"I've had my eye on this necklace for about one year before deciding to purchase. When I first viewed it at that time, however, it was advertised as being a 16"" necklace, which is exactly the length I prefer. It was out of stock for some time and when it reappeared it was advertised as a 22"" length. Unsure if this was a printing error, I decided that if I still wanted it this much after twelve months, I should just go ahead and order it. I was very pleased with the delivery time, but the necklace is, indeed, 22"" as described. I liked it enough that I decided to take it to a jeweler to be shortened. They did a very nice job and I'm glad it's finally mine. The clasp, although no one will probably ever see it except me, is  extremely unique and easy for me to operate. I was startled, however, the first night I wore it, to feel it drop away from my neck. It may have come undone after being caught in my hair... I'm not sure. I will need to be very aware of the possibility of this happening when I wear it in the future. I'm not sure if anyone else has ever had this experience or not, but would be interested in hearing so if they did.<br />Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase. The bee is a special symbol to me, and this one is beautiful."
4.0,One pair seems to be smaller than the other pair
4.0,"I really like the vintage look of the swimsuit. I am 5'4&#34; and about 175 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fit ok. The back part comes up a little to reveal my bottom just a bit, but the front seems a little loose. Overall, it is a pretty swimsuit."
4.0,"Cute earrings, bigger than expected though"
4.0,"I normally wear a 6 in uggs and I bought a 7 because I like my slippers to be loose, these were tight and required a bit of breaking in, they are fine now, but definitely glad I got a size bigger."
4.0,Loved it! The dress was midge tight in the arms and chest so I am getting the medium. I hope it works it out because the dress is really nice.
4.0,I love the fit and loved that it wasn't short. But I didn't love the fabric.
4.0,"A little something to remind me of Bahamas last year. The flag seemed a little simple, but it was ok for the price"
4.0,"Fit as expected, good material"
4.0,"Just a tiny bit small, I got a large and I am a 40D and its a bit snug, but stretches quite a bit, I love this bra so much because the support us what I needed and it gives me support and lift, I love it so much i bought another!!!! I wasnt paid, nor compensated nor received anything at a discount, i just wanted to share because it isbao hard to find bras for my size, this one is a keeper!!!"
4.0,I like the fit.  It pulls down to the top of the ears the way I like.
4.0,"En la foto aparece como.un vestido cortito pero a mi me quedo demaciado largo, mido 5,7 180 lbs x sugerencia de Amazon debía pedir la talla XL pero esta solo quedo bien en los hombros, de los senos hacia abajo quedo anchisimo y largo<br />Devolveré y pediré una L a ver si mejora porque si se ajusta más al cuerpo y sube el largo a medio muslo queda muy bonito."
4.0,"Three necklaces nice.  Fourth had lion's head sideways.  Sent a wolf head I did not order.  Arrived early, which I appreciated.  Everyone liked the lionhead, good design.  The fourth was to be mine.  Wish I had a good one, not mismade.!!"
4.0,These are super cute but they are not for “girls”. These are definitely more for adults than children.
4.0,I liked dress I bought it for my husband's command Christmas party. It was roaring 20s theme.
4.0,"I needed just a simple, small gray purse and this fits the bill for the most part.  Most purses have a smaller zipped pocket on the inside wall of the lining (perfect for keeping those monthly items hidden).  Sadly, this one does not have that pocket.  It has the larger zipped pocket in the middle (not stitched/attached to the purse lining so things can float from one side of the purse to the other) but I would prefer to not have to worry about certain ""things"" showing when I open that to get my lotion or chapstick out.  I can fit a small wallet, my iphone 10, a small notebook, pen, and a few more items.  Small, cute, works well except for the the missing pocket.  Keep in mind, it is a less expensive bag so do expect it to be the most amazing quality.  It's not horribly bad but it's definitely no Michael Kors."
4.0,"Seems well-built enough, but is less comfortable than the OEM silicone wristband on the Pebble Time."
4.0,bought a small i am US6 it fit perfect
4.0,"I really like these boots. The only reason I am giving a 4 star is due to the difficulty in putting them on. With socks on it was extremely difficult to put on. Slightly difficult without socks on. I normally wear a size 10. But After I read all the reviews I did order a size bigger. I am glad I did, they fit perfect."
4.0,"Great pair of leggings, perfect for warmer weather. They are thinner than I expected, but the quality is nice, so is the material. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I love this ring! Even waiting forever for it to arrive, the quality of this product for the price J paid, was satisfying. I would definitely order another item from them."
4.0,Just as the pic shows
4.0,"It does not take inches off your waist or even give it the appearance but it's still one of the better investments I've made in a while.  My big self stretches out the belt notches but with this ratchet the belt keeps it form.  I've had the belt for about two months now and the only one I've used for work since it arrived.  Half star off for the ""assembly required"" which I was not expecting and half star off for not taking the inches off my waist (foolishly expected)."
4.0,"It's all good, just the cards and cash is a bit more tough to remove than I'd prefer. Besides that, all fine. Also, it's surprisingly slim in my back pockets, enough so that I don't notice it there even when I'm sitting on it. In fact, I started to worry if I could even tell if it's not with me in the case I lose it or forget it home"
4.0,It’s wonderful but tips are too small 🥺🥺🥺
4.0,"Great climbing shoes, feel great and very comfortable, but the foot step breaks after a month or so"
4.0,"It's not thin material, which is nice, but the fabric is not super soft either."
4.0,"This is see through,  but cute."
4.0,I love the pin. The graphics and quality are spectacular. My only negative is that the pin arrived slightly damaged in that one of the prongs on the back was bent. It still works but it's not perfect and that's disappointing. Great for trolling the flat-earthers in my little town.
4.0,I’ve owned this now a little less than a year. So far I like it. It’s durable. Looks good. And has plenty of storage. I did apply leather conditioner to it almost immediately. Still needs some breaking in but overall very nice bag.
4.0,"Bought this for my hubby as a gift and he’s over the moon with it.  He has arthritis and the cuffs that cover his hands he likes the best.  He also likes all the pockets.  I bought him a Large in blue.  Beautiful color.  The Size was a tad small so we returned with excellent help and reordered the XL.  He has a Polo jacket that he wore all the time.  It was a light weight jacket and this Baubax has just a tad more lining so it’s a bit nicer in cool weather.  He wore it in the rain and it kept him dry.  He put the hood up and the eye covering kept falling down.  He didn’t like that.  So I am going to sew a button and loop on it so he can secure it and keep it up when he doesn’t want his eyes covered.  It’s an easy fix, but wish the manufacturer would have discovered this problem and fixed it...  Easy enough.  Very happy I bought him the jacket."
4.0,Bought these for my kiddo who doesn't like going to the University football games because it's too loud. He loved them. We made it comfortably through the game. They fit him well and I can see they would extend up to fit even me or my husband.
4.0,"Very good quality - all edges are bound to keep damage to a minimum.  Attention to detail in stitching.  If anything, too many interior divisions. This was perfect for a ""mini"" leather backpack I owned, that I was ordering specifically for.  However, if you own a Loungefly mini backpack, this is about 1 inches too large to fit - in all dimensions."
4.0,"Nice face mask, decent quality"
4.0,These are nice I bought them for my grandson
4.0,Really pretty unfortunately you cannot see the names..... Gave it 4 stars only because it's pretty
4.0,"This band feels like nothing is on my wrist most of the time, only problem is that my dog's hair sticks to it."
4.0,It’s thin and a lil faded but cute
4.0,"Perfect for my 11 year old. Yes, they run small. Bought the 14/16 size for my 11 year old. She's happy with these bras."
4.0,"The purse is really nice. It looks just like the picture. I received a lot of compliments, everyone love the purse."
4.0,"I ordered a Medium, it was very much smaller than expected. I will give it to someone else and order a larger size for my husband."
4.0,"Very nice.  Pretty piece.  Although a little sharp on the edges & a bit uncomfortable, it is very attractive.  This is one of those times you get what you pay for - and that is okay!"
4.0,"Heavy sweater like material so don't wear in hot weather, but great cut. Length on me was almost ankle and I was looking for knee. Good color and the pleating is very flattering. Waist was a little small for my liking and I feared it would shrink after washing. Pockets are inconspicuous and deep."
4.0,"I don’t imagine my Dad would wear this Particular Hat, for Baseball or Golf but, it is a fine and well made Hat by Jeff & Aimy so, it’s all good. It’s definitely ready for some Hip and Fancy Night Out on the Town, especially if it’s an 1980’s Night. I think they did another fine job on a Hat.  I would refer it to anyone that is into Styling, especially the ladies but, I don’t think a guy want to wear it as a Fishing Cap but, you never know; they may bite more. Haha! Enjoy!"
4.0,"Too small for an adult, should say Childrens earrings"
4.0,"These were beautiful, good quality"
4.0,"For a quick fix, it's great.  But I prefer to use a sponge and silver polish."
4.0,"I LOVE these earrings, but I was disappointed when they first arrived. As with most earrings the care in packing can make or BREAK their delicacy and sure enough one was broken upon delivery. Lucky for me, the break was clean and could be easily fixed with a hot glue gun.<br />The pink is so subtle and romantic, I can wear them with everything!!!"
4.0,"I was hoping to play basketball in these, but they are better for everyday wear."
4.0,Cute Christmas pjs for the family.
4.0,I like it. Fabric feels great. The logo is a bit too low. For small size- The 'I heart' part gets hid under my boobs and the 'handstands' is in the middle. I have a longer torso so it would be even lower on short people.
4.0,"This sweater feels comfortable. nice design. However, to those buying this sweater, I 100% guarantee that you get one size smaller than your normal fit if you’re not as hugely buff because the arm of the sweater is fit to as a bodybuilder so you will have more space there then intended."
4.0,The product arrived on time in great condition it's a perfect fit to my foot stitching is well put together and feels great on my feet the only thing that I could see for a downside is that there isn't enough padding or the painting that they used isn't thick enough but if you want to be hiking and more versatile and your movements I can see why the minimized on that other than the padding issue or the product is great.
4.0,"I had writren a review telling them that the necklace was not stainless steel, which they have now had rectified.<br /><br />So since writing that review, Spunkysoul have been in touch with me, and have refunded me the money. They were very quick to respond, and have been very good with taking care of my problem. So thank you!"
4.0,Product came one day earlier than expected which is always nice. Looks great and packaged in a cute little sack. Perfect for gifting.
4.0,"Product works great.  The ear muffs are a little tight and could stand to be just a little bigger for a more universal fit. If you have a larger head, you can expect a very tight fit."
4.0,"I love the way the bag looks, but the pictures are a bit deceiving.  It is smaller than I expected.  I will still use it, but it won't work for a catch all bag for me and the things for my niece for a day-trip (what I was originally planning on using it for).  You can fit a wallet and a 7&#34; tablet or a kindle in it, but it wouldn't have a lot of room left over. (wallet being a checkbook wallet with multiple card slots)  It would be great for a regular daily purse though, as well as having decent sized pockets for holding keys, phone, or other things in the front.  The strap is comfortable and didn't seem to slip while I was using it.  So not what I expected, but still usable."
4.0,"Although a bit small in the hips and long in the leg, I do like these workout leggings, and can attest that my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) fits just fine in the pocket, snug and secure, but not bulky. The fit of these leggings around the thighs and calves is snug if you are heavily muscled, but not uncomfortable. I have run, walked, lifted weights, danced, and stretched in these, without fear."
4.0,"Not the best quality, but very good value given the price. It fits well and looks nice. The waist is actually around 30"" and the bust is 36"". The fabric is lower quality and took a bit of steam to get half the wrinkles out. I think it's worth the purchase."
4.0,"The shirt itself is wonderful, however I payed an extra $8.00 for faster shipping and it gave me a week period of when it should arrive. Thinking I was paying that $8.00 to get it closer to the beginning days of that week, I was wrong. The shirt came on the final day projected and this was late for the occasion I needed it for. Don’t waste your money on paying for quicker shipping, but the product itself is wonderful."
4.0,The shirt is great but it definitely runs big
4.0,"I like the way that these fit however, I still do get a bit of a camel toe if I have my feet together. They are very comfortable and didn’t slide down at all during my workout."
4.0,These are good socks but they are a little thin.
4.0,Nice strap just the ends taper off too narrowly so it looks really small in width
4.0,Great pack of options for some good readers.
4.0,"Likes: styling, ease of use, and lightweight overall. Dislikes: ear loops are too tight and pull at ears. Need to fasten the behind-the-head/neck atttachment for comfort. External valves get real lose and one fell off and went missing during a workout."
4.0,The arms were snug
4.0,It supports the back and fits securely around the waist with out  moving off the target areas when you start to sweat...
4.0,Was very thin cheap made
4.0,"Purchased for tennis play. Love the attached shorts, the comfort and how it looks from the front. I gave it an overall four because the back is significantly longer than the front and doesn’t look good to me. Perhaps it’s meant for someone more curvy to take up that length? I purchased white in small. I’m 5’3”, 103 lbs."
4.0,Update: I took off a star for the following reason. I've had these in my Go Bag since I purchased them in April. My grand-daughter likes wearing &#34;Nama's&#34; Sunnies when I visit once a week. A couple of weeks ago I pull them out of my bag & there was a crack on the top rim & the left lens fell right out. Sooo bummed. But I liked the design & they are comfortable on her so I took a chance & ordered another pair. We'll see... X'ing my fingers.<br /><br />It's important to me [and her parents] that they are polarized & that she'll always wear them. They fit my 2YO grand-daughter. She wears sunglasses whenever she's outside. And she puts them on herself. These have a little room to grow but she's comfortable with them; they don't fall off. She has another pair of the same make at home & these are a pair I bring with me when I visit so I always have a handy pair. I like the quality.
4.0,I wore this dress for a cousin’s African themed 40th birthday party. I love this dress. It came quickly and for exactly as expected. I may buy in other colors.
4.0,"I'm usually a medium and that's what I ordered, it may be because I am tall but the arms are not long enough to comfortably put my thumbs through the holes, which was a little disappointing. Other than that I love it!"
4.0,Fit every curve can't wait to wear it out 🥰
4.0,My wife was pleased.
4.0,i like it... it's soft and comfortable but is a bit short to wear without leggings unless you are very young.  :)
4.0,"Bought this sneakers for my boyfriend. Fits really well, it's just a bit bigger than expected, as size 10.5 is his regular size but this sneakers has some room at the toes. It's not too bad though and he enjoys wearing them and they are very comfortable."
4.0,"I love the way this product looked on my ear and got so many compliments on it-- however it is pretty painful. The &#34;hands&#34; and &#34;legs&#34; on the climbing man are pretty sharp, however it's not terrible. The cuteness is definitely worth the pain. Unfortunately I was stupid and went to the beach with this on-- don't go swimming in the ocean with this on! I (understandably) lost it after that but I think I will get another one. Overall, very cute and you will get compliments with this on."
4.0,"This bra is the best I've found for people like me who have a large breasts but a small band measurement. I searched all over looking for a nursing bra in my size, both online and in stores. This is just about the only one I found, and I was so happy to find one that finally fit all the way to my rib cage. I can't overemphasize the value of a good bra (especially for nursing): less pain in my back, more comfortable support, no sagging breasts, etc.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I also had a hard time with the front clasps. In fact, I couldn't even get it unclasped the first time I tried. I had to ask my husband for help. But I found that after hooking and unhooking them a few times it was far easier. I like it a lot, but just a few complaints: (1) The material is a bit stiff. I was hoping it would be softer. (2) There are only two hooks in the back. Most larger bras have 3 for better support. (3) I wish the hooks in the front were easier to hook and unhook."
4.0,My sister loves it bought this as a Christmas present
4.0,Nice outfit for price. Purchased this for my grandchild.
4.0,"The dress was perfect for a tea.  It was delivered on time, size fits perfect and looks exactly like the picture!  Would probably be even prettier if it was more of a sheer sleeve."
4.0,You need to have straight teeth for these and pretty cool i bought these as a joke not to be worn all day
4.0,Thankfully i Sized up otherwise this product would've been a total waste! I do think this looks really great with my figure and its not as short in the back as i thought it was gonna be (which is a plus) I would recommend Purchasing this but just a size up! Other wise its perfect!
4.0,Dress is too big and thin. But it is still pretty
4.0,"This is a good Christmas gift from our toddler to Grandma, but it's not high quality and I don't expect her to wear it daily. It's more a &#34;it's the thought that counts&#34; kind of gift"
4.0,"It runs small, but is absolutely beautiful, I will make it work."
4.0,Beautiful.<br />The wrist band itself is tiny but luckily so is the wrist of the person I bought it for.<br /><br />Wish it was waterproof.  That's my only con.
4.0,"Worked great .... When i finished with it ... cut in half and put it around my dogs neck, very cool.<br />Buddy"
4.0,"I have these in patent leather and black PU now, and I've found it's really important to check the leg opening, as they're not made for ""normal sized calves"" like mine (I'm no athlete, but I'm certainly not chunky either). I just don't bother lacing them tight, and I like the little wedges where my skin shows through at the top. I did need to get longer laces to do this though (just a warning).<br /><br />The patent ones squeaked REALLY badly when I first got them, however I used a handy tip from a dancer and put baby oil on the tongue of the boots, on the inside edge of the zipper and the inside of where the laces, and they hardly make a sound now. Mostly the problem was around the ankle with the movement as I walked but it's not an issue after a few drops of baby oil and leaving them overnight.<br /><br />These also look great with ribbons laced through instead of regular laces - and you can then match colours for a bunch of different outfits.<br /><br />They're very comfortable to walk in. The platform sole makes it feel like wearing just 2 inch heels, and they arch in just the right place but the soles are quite solid - maybe some basic foam insoles would make them a little more comfy for a night of dancing and such? Or maybe I'm just a wuss.<br /><br />Anyway, great boots, would definitely recommend - these take me from the office, to meeting my mother, to a night out in town."
4.0,"This is a cute swim skirt. But, like what previous reviewers reported, it rides up when you walk which is a bit annoying b/c let's face it, if you are wearing a swim skirt, you are wanting to hide the areas you are trying to cover."
4.0,"The blue is such a nice color! Quality is great, perfect for the men that have a few cards though prefer to always carry cash, two pockets for cash, its pretty awesome! Medium sized, not too big not too small or thin, I reccomend it."
4.0,"Only looses a few seconds a month, but the band causes a rash on my wrist so I only wear it when I need it. could just be me.but I still enjoy looking at it.....P.S. I only tried wal-mart but could not find a replacement band."
4.0,I ordered this purse because I liked the look and the reviews. The price was very reasonable. The only thing was in the description of the bag it says it is 12.2 x 3 and 9in high. But when it arrived it is actually 14.5 x 3 x 11 high. I did really like it but ended up passing it on to someone who likes a larger purse. Would luv one this size they say it is but could not find one. Just gets a 4 star instead of 5 for false dimensions.
4.0,This is a very nice set.  I'm 5ft6in and 148....the large fit just right. A little long on me but an easy fix. Pretty good quality.
4.0,I love these shoes. Very sturdy and durable. My daughter wears them with her uniform and they are super cute.
4.0,Its good quality to be honest but slightly thinner than what it should be! But i like it<br /><br />Thanks
4.0,"The rosary is smaller than I expected, compared to my last purchased blue tiger eyes. It is exquisite anyways."
4.0,"It was, ckose fitting and not overly gasping  in the crutch."
4.0,"Super cute! The zipper doesn’t close the entire bag all the way, there’s a decent size hole where it’s just open, figure that’s worth mentioning, it’s towards the back of he purse too, so if you’re keeping valuables in there it doesn’t seem like it would be too hard to pickpocket. I don’t know if that was just the bag I received or all of them. But for what I need this for it’s cute and perfect. Strap is adjustable, and it comes with it untied from the little circle band."
4.0,"Not as good quality as I was led to believe. However that is not to say they are bad. The wood is nice and lightweight. My only real criticism is that the metal bits should be made of something stronger in the future. Something that does not feel as plyable. The clubmaster pair does not have great sun protection from the sides because the nose stands push the frames away from your face. Because of this I will buy the wayfarer style next from the Woodies brand. The polarization is great especially for those cloudless sunny days when you turn a corner driving only to face the sun directly.  I have received many comments on the glasses, not all of them great but most approved. I will give Woodies a recommendation to anyone interested. Try them, all the babes will love you. Okay, maybe just some babes and other people too."
4.0,"Great value and good quality, i did not read the details and found out the hard way that the metal ball is not detachable"
4.0,The color is very pretty and it is true to the picture. The only issue is I wish the back part was wider for me because I have a wide back. Other than this is great for anyone.
4.0,"We ordered this suit when we arrived at the beach this year to find that my teenage daughter was uncomfortable in her current suit and wanted more support. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this fit, how comfortable it was for her, and how well this worked for her. She definitely cares more about fit and function so that she can be active than style and trendiness. However, she likes the look of this and the colors work well. Overall, very pleased with this purchase, especially for the price."
4.0,I still loove these fruit they are so cute. I notice.that you only get 40 and it use to be 60. I like.that.deal better. Maybe I purchased from 2 different sellers. And these were a little higher in price.
4.0,"These are not bad, especially for the price. I didn't love the feel of them, but I'm wierdly particular about my leggings being soft. These are not very soft. I knew I was rolling the dice on the xs. I'm usually a small, (sometimes xs depending on brand.) Xs was in stock so that's what I tried. They are slightly small, but still wearable. (I usually wear a 25 sometimes a 26 in jeans.)"
4.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift, it turned out smaller than expected but it was still a good size. The charm was wonderful and he loved it and so did I. The only real complaint is I would advise replacing the chain. It did come with a spare chain, but the chain broke easily."
4.0,"Very pretty, soft leather bag for the price. The zipper is a little awkward."
4.0,For a 5’8 165lbs the sleeves are too long but the leggings are good.
4.0,"Love these boots , my toddler runs in them perfectly and has received many compliments. I pulled off the gold little plate off the bottom side of the boot to make them look better though"
4.0,BEAUTIFUL skirt jus runs real real even<br />When using size guide... its way off. Quality<br />Is Good n well made.
4.0,material little thick
4.0,Easy to use. I can put my bracelets on by myself.
4.0,"Super comfy, however I have to re-adjust the tie frequently and pull them up.  Not an issue with fit, just a design issue."
4.0,Great fit-heavy duty sweatshirt. Love it.
4.0,"I took a chance and bought these even though they didn't have my usual size (10), but thought maybe they will fit. Unfortunately, they were too small. I returned them, but if they had fit, these would have been added to my everyday shoes. They are really cute. Only thing is I was not sure how durable the material would be after a while. Definitely seemed like you would get a crease in the part that bends with your foot."
4.0,cute but uncomfortable
4.0,Beautiful dress.  Zipper sticks.  Love the material and overall fit of the dress.
4.0,"I would have gave it a 5 star but no way to connect the sash together. We use a paperclip it worked for the short time I wore it. The crown is have and sturdy, a little heavy to wear but I stuck it out."
4.0,I love the idea it's kind of cheap but hasnt broke on me yet so I can't say it's bad but honestly for $4 I would expect that!!
4.0,"I gave this nightgown only 4 stars because it is not lined liked my white La Cera one that I already had. I like it though and since I only have my husband for an audience when I wear it, I guess the lack of lining doesn't matter! It does keep me cool in the summertime. It is very pretty and comfortable. I would recommend it and the other La Cera products."
4.0,Colors are not true to photo.
4.0,I guess I have a really long torso even though I am only 5'5&#34;. It offered no support for the girls. This would be really cute on a girl with a smaller chest. Good quality and fast shipping.
4.0,"It’s a cute comfy dress… but it is VERY short, especially if you have a booty. I wore it with leggings and it fit more like a tunic."
4.0,"it came as shown, but i didn't order this product...."
4.0,"I got this for my teenager who is non binary and was needing something in between a binder and a sports bra, and I found this. It’s a nice in between. It’s not too tight, they says it’s quite comfortable for them.<br /><br />UPDATE: the zipper broke somewhat early on. It only lasted about 3-4 months.  It was great while it lasted.  But I’m going to have to take away a star."
4.0,great price for decent quality!
4.0,Not a compression garment like we were expecting
4.0,"These pants are cute and comfy. Very short on me, I'm 5'8. So I will cuff them and it'll be fine. However I ordered the red ones and the are more of a very deep dusty rose color. I was hoping they'd be more of a brick red. Disappointed in the color, but happy with the pants. They are lightweight and will be comfortable for the southern heat."
4.0,Ordered two size larger for roomy fit- to wear with thicker sweaters. Not as much down fill as I expected. Still warm and nice coverage. Large buttons work better than I expected.
4.0,My daughter absolutely loves them.
4.0,"This purse is super versatile with its multicolored of brow, tan, black, and white. I can wear it with many outfits and it’s my go to with enough space for my daily needs. It sits up right, just have to be cautious with the leather that you are gentle with it, otherwise it may dent in some spots. Otherwise, love this purse!"
4.0,"Great product! Wish the tulle was a little longer and heavier. My little girl is on the long but skinny side. We ordered a small, which fit but was a little snug. Another reviewer mentioned the flower covering up the writing. We didn't have any issues. Only issue we had was little one grabbing one of the roses from the crown, which popped out. Nothing a little hot glue couldn't fix. Go a size up! Def recommend!"
4.0,"It took a long time to get here, several weeks, so order early. It looks just like the picture and is exactly what I was expecting, so if you're looking for small gifts or stocking stuffers this is a win!"
4.0,"I love this outfit, but it is too large. But we will be able to wear it soon."
4.0,This belt looked nice  but after 3 months the prong that fits in the holes in the belt  just snapped off was very disappointed belts should last a few years
4.0,Came as advertised. Simple to change the lenses out. One complaint I have is that based on the ad I thought the lenses were more mirrored than blue.
4.0,Dress is very pretty. Fit was good (5’6’’ 150lbs). ZIP was difficult at the top. Mesh on the sides would of shown any bra for me (36D). Bought 2 other options for event so returning this one.
4.0,"Me ajusto bastante bien, pero no me quedo del largo como se le ve a la modelo, al parecer soy mas alta..."
4.0,"The stone color looks gray in the product photos, but it’s really more of a tan/brown color. I was looking forward to gray so that was a downer for me. I set the red band on top of my original Apple band for width comparison. I’m getting used to the slimmer band, but thought it looked strange at first. Band is comfortable. Soft silicon. Fits perfectly with the watch. Good overall value."
4.0,"Sizes aren't whole sizes, they come like flip flop sizes. Ex..4/5, my daughter wears a 4 ane has a fat foot and they are perfect for her which I dont prefer perfect I like a little wiggle room. Overall Im satisfied"
4.0,"Very cute! Fit my 2yo with room to grow, and feel durable!"
4.0,The size as stated is big. You will need to go up a few sizes than normal.  It fit great just wish straps were more secure.
4.0,Item was received and was as described
4.0,A nice watch especially for the price BUT the small is not just referring to the face size (which is actually medium size) but the wrist band too.  This is much shorter than my other watches - barely fits in last hole though the band can be stretched a little.
4.0,Daughter Happy
4.0,On the narrow side but good quality sandle.
4.0,"This are beautiful and delicate and I love them. However. I’m on my second one because they break easily. You get what you pay for and I’m still satisfied, but keep it in mind."
4.0,Very pretty. My only issue is that the chain is quite short. I'm going to have to go out and buy a longer chain.
4.0,Love the wrist part even though I wish they were a little smaller.  Loved the look.
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter... She love them... She has been wearing them frequently for 2 months now and the shoe seems to hold. She runs and jumps in these, I thought maybe these were not sturdy enough, but they seem to be.  Anyway, good shoe"
4.0,"Kiddo loves them! They seem like decent quality, they are comfy and she loves the print!"
4.0,"The only thing is I was expecting the pocket in the middle of the purse to divide the purse in half.  Instead, the pocket is on 1/4 of the purse and a bit smaller than I expected.  I love the construction.  It has heavy duty clasps which is where I usually have issues.  Excellent purse!!"
4.0,This tank top is amazing.I want to order another one.
4.0,"Overall, this is a nice chain.  The construction is solid, the length is great, the clasp works well, and the shine/sheen is just right.  The only complaint I have is the thickness.  With the way the chain is designed, the thickness causes it to bind and become tangled very, very easily.  Putting it on in the AM it sits great, but within an hour or two most days, I noticed it became tangled near the pendant I wear on it.  Not a huge thing, and possibly just the nature of the design/thickness, but it is a small issue to be aware of."
4.0,"They are a tiny bit lose at the waist, and a bit see through. Overall they are great for the price especially  with this design. I'm 5'3 @ 144lbs and this fit fine bought them to work out in and the do the job."
4.0,"The size of these earrings are perfect.  They are really nice, but they do not look at all lavender.  They actually look like the gem stone for the month of June called Alexandrite.  They are perfect to give as a gift as well."
4.0,Very stylish and could double as a cute top.
4.0,The top is very nice but it's a bit tight in the shoulder area4
4.0,Very cheaply made. I bought better at Walmart for less.
4.0,Nice material and great dress for the price
4.0,Very don johnson
4.0,"LILBETTER, kindly sent me another in the place of the one that was too small."
4.0,"Plastic band gets a little sweaty, but it's a $10 watch. Good enough for me!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b56a681d9f56efc7a5cdc87346dfb9dc]] I love the fit and it is more comfortable than the apple band! The only downside is the way I hook it for my comforter I catch the latch and on pips open. However there are two latches so it NEVER has fallen off! I ended up buying another pack because of the comfort.
4.0,I ordered a pair of these maybe two years ago and loved them because of how high they went up. These new ones do not go up as high :(
4.0,"Gift to granddaughter,  she loved it."
4.0,"perfect length & color but the waist is very small, it was suppose to be large and I only wear medium but it was very small"
4.0,I wish the sole was navy. The light color because of it being a sandal shows dirt to fast.
4.0,Fits well and wears well so far. Await its washing and endurance over time.
4.0,"The prettiest pair of the bunch of CZ's this size stone, the color is so nice, worth every cent, seller very good."
4.0,"They definitely look like 80s techno visors, but I feel there's a lot to be desired for the $10. They're definitely thinner than I was expecting. And they felt like they could break at any moment. Plus they smudge easily.<br />To be fair.. I was wearing them at a rave (80s themed), and they were pretty popular with those around us. So.. Maybe for $10 it wasn't a bad investment."
4.0,great coffee color - warm and fit well
4.0,Pro:<br />Light weight<br />Stylish<br />Hidden pops of hot pink<br />Double sided zipper kangaroo pouch<br />Tight snowmelt<br />Hood fits around helmet with elastic senches<br /><br />Con:<br />wish the sleeve pass holder was zippered instead of velco<br />Wish overall length was slightly shorter<br />Wish there was a media pocket so your phone does rattle around in the kangaroo pouch<br />Amazon recommended Large but it was much too big
4.0,The only unfortunate issue was the material was thin and started fraying after one wash on the gentle cycle.
4.0,"Love the look, rather than return gave to a friend"
4.0,a bit wide at bottom so if it fits on top it will be sloppy on  bottom
4.0,"The material is soft, and I love the longer length of the legs. They seem to run a little small, and are very fitted all the way to the knee where they begin to flair out. They fit snugly, but the material is very stretchy, and comfortable."
4.0,I bought these and i positivly adored them! i wore them everywhere then i dropped it (for like four feet off the ground) and the plastic got a crack in it! i wouldn't have really cared but that crack connected to the area wherre it was supposed to screw on! so when i tried screwing them together it broke and was utterly unusable :c it was probably my fault but it could have been made out of stronger plastic! :c
4.0,"Super soft and comfy, great quality and thick. I usually wear a size medium - large, but after reading some reviews I decided to go XL. Glad I did, perfect fit. I'm 5'9&#34; and would of preferred the length a bit longer, but still a great fit as is. No plumbers crack when I sit down or bend!"
4.0,"Dress is beautiful, however, it has one button to keep it close...so don't wear it on a windy day and be sure to wear something under it. It will fly open and you will be exposed."
4.0,My son wears it! It is fancy for him.
4.0,"Fabric a little thin for jacket, but overall vibrant colors cute jacket. 👍"
4.0,"This dress was so cute on me, everyone loved my dresss."
4.0,This was a present for my sister when she graduated from dental hygienist school. I got it because not only did it have a tooth and tooth brush but a pink heart and that's her favorite color so it was perfect.
4.0,"I found that these were good for low intensity exercise as opposed to very active exercise.  I use them primarily when lifting weights or even just as shoes around the house.  When I attempted to wear them during Kickboxing they did fly off my foot.<br />The fit is very good, true to size.  The elastic around the ankle and across the foot is comfortable, it does not constrict movement or create an uncomfortable pressure.  I've been wearing them for a few months and so far the construction of the shoe has held up well.  The cushion is minimal and would be good for someone looking for a minimalist fit, the main fabric is breathable and light weight.<br />the bonus wrist wallet has been more helpful than I anticipated.  I use it frequently when I go for walks or just don't want to carry a purse.  The value is very good for the price of the product.  I would recommend this others."
4.0,I love this top but I'm petitie (under 5') and the top is long. I don't mind and still wear with my leggings but just keep in mind when buying. The shoulders and arms fit well.
4.0,"I have the sport series belt and used for spirited canyon rides. Very nice product, works as advertised. My wife likes it very much as she has less tendency slide out of the pillion into my seat and it provides a more secure hold of me when we ride. She no longer has sore wrists bracing herself on the tank.<br />  The belt material is soft and pliable but I would have prefered more ridged  material like leather for the back as the poly plastic material  seems like a detriment to longevity. My experience with these plastics are as they age coupled with exposure to the elements and UV rays they tend to harden and get brittle. The velcro on the belt gets alot of use and is showing it and I find myself trying not to remove the belt as often. The buckle does made contact with my tank so make sure your tank is protected.<br />  Overall we are happy with this belt as it has made our rides a better  more enjoyable experience."
4.0,I RECOMMEND IT
4.0,They're kinda nice. You can tell they're plastic however.
4.0,"Very nice, little thin on material but stylish cardigan."
4.0,"I ordered this QegarTop Women’s striped sweater for one of our daughters and she says that she likes the Khaki block color, the design and the styling of the V neck, the side slit, and the drawstring. She says she doesn't like how much this long sleeve pullover is see- through. She says she decided to buy an undershirt for it. Other than that, our daughter says that the sweatshirt fits her pretty well, comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off, and she likes the fabric is soft, smooth and gentle on her skin.<br />She likes that this sweatshirt matches a lot of her pants, jeans, shoes and her other fashion accessories. Overall this is a good pullover considering the quality and the price. I would recommend it."
4.0,I love the suit. It fits nicely everywhere except the thighs. They are a little tight there.
4.0,Great pieces for gift giving purposes
4.0,"Beautiful and flashy meant for fun. I have an avg  neck length, so these earrings are a little too long for me, so I folded the length in half. Which also gave it a fuller look. Still sassy fun."
4.0,Got this to protect my prescription sunglasses and regular glasses and keep them together in one place.  It does a good job and I love the turquoise color.  It may be too small for oversize frames.
4.0,"I have worn Merrell's shoes for years.. love them.. Bought these on deal and have started to enjoy what these shoes do too... very flexible to shove in a suitcase or back pack as an extra pair of shoes... Lighter, not as sturdy, not as long lasting as traditional Merrell's but really have enjoyed wearing in hotels and out on the street... They wear well.. just not as long.  I have waited to provide a review but have waited about 6 months to see how these shoes wear!<br /><br />My feet tend to swell when walking etc and these work perfectly. They do not have the same level of support but I really enjoy how they feel on my feet. More and more these are my go to shoes... I could easily wear the black shoes walking the French Quarter Fest and going to nice restaurants in New Orleans."
4.0,"I wear boots 99% of the time, these are very comfortable and fit great. Great price and seem to be well made."
4.0,"This product worked better than I thought it would. There are two clothes sewn together. The inside cloth is white and is treated with some chemical to work off tarnish and other oils/buildup (you don't smell the chemical at all but their information sheet lets you know there are chemicals present). The outer blue cloth is for polishing. It worked wonderful on all of my silver jewelry, even the things that weren't real silver.<br /><br />Do not use this cloth on any jewelry with glued in stones as the chemicals on the white cloth cause the stones to come out.<br /><br />My only complaint was that it makes your fingers smudgy and a bit smelly. The dirt is visibly left behind on the white cloth but also on your fingers.<br /><br />Overall a good product, excellent for the $5 price tag."
4.0,I have a size 42 foot with long legs- these socks are great for me as they have alot of length from the heel calf. I love them! They are plain looking and are good under my work attire. Great value for money.<br />Unfortunately one pair has a ladder in them.... :(
4.0,I like the waistband stengther.  I was surprised to see that it really works.
4.0,"As many reviewers have stated, these are NOT really compression shirts. The material is also on the thinner side (not see through just not thick when you are thinking compression). They are cute simple workout shirt with the stretchy dri sweat material. Overall, I like the shirts but that's because I bought them knowing that many people said they weren't compression shirts."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful but,  the arms and bodice was too tight."
4.0,Beautiful color but could have been made of sturdier material. There are many scratches on checked in luggage after just one use on round trip flight and transfer to cruise ship. The zipper also came off track on large piece but able to fix and thankfully avoid contents lost. Loved the ease of maneuvering spinner wheels. Best use may be road trip to ensure durability.
4.0,"Dope day to day watch. I wear it to sleep, to the gym and in the shower. It's a great active watch that flexes with you (the silver Casio jabs my skin at times). Fast shipping worth the $"
4.0,"It was a very beautiful dress, but somewhat small. not long enough I should say."
4.0,Not very comfortable but the thickness is good.
4.0,"A gift for a friend to say "" I'm thinking of you"" she loves everything leapard !!!"
4.0,"The versatility of a denim jacket cannot be overestimated. When I saw this one available on Vine, I requested it and here we are. This review is of: SANGTREE Women's Button Down Denim Jacket.<br /><br />I requested the jacket in black, because it goes with everything. The fit on the XL I received is perfect everywhere except for the very bottom, I cannot button it. What a bummer. I also noted that along the bottom and at the bottom button area there are a lot of hanging threads.<br /><br />Other than that this jacket is great. The plain silver buttons add a nice decorative flair and of course they're functional as well. The jacket material is a bit stiff, but I assume that it will wear in nicely over time. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this jacket, I just wish I could button it at the bottom."
4.0,I love this shirt! So versatile. Can wear with jeans or slim pants with heels! I gave it four stars because the stripped part doesnt match the white of the shirt. It like a off white/cream color.
4.0,NICE EARRINGS BUT THEY WERE SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT.
4.0,Todo normal
4.0,Love this swim suit. I ordered my regular size and it was a great fit. Very slimming and covers my back fat.  Quality material too.
4.0,These lasted a little over 2 months.
4.0,Cute little dress. Perfect for any number of occasions.
4.0,"Love the pants otherwise I would have sent them back. Based on customer reviews and the size chart, I sized up. I like how they look, but they are so long. I am 5' 3"" tall and will have to get them hemmed probably about 2 1/2"". It would have been nice to have a shorter version of these pants to choose from."
4.0,The opal is nice
4.0,"You are Braver than you Believe, Stronger  than you Seem and Smarter than you Think!  This is such an inspirational quote to me!  I sometimes suffer from depression (maybe a bit more than sometimes) and I constantly have to remind myself that I can do better, not to give up and not  to give in.  I have been wearing this bracelet constantly from the moment I got it and every time I feel overwhelmed I read the inscription on this bracelet and my inner Warrior Princess kicks in and takes charge!  The bracelet itself is very thin and the writing is delicate.  The only issue I have at all with the bracelet is that &#34;seem&#34; is misspelled as &#34;seam&#34;.  Since the writing is so delicate and written is cursive the misspelling is hardly noticeable though.  Disclosure! I was allowed to review this product at a  discount in return for my honest opinion.  All opinions expressed in this review are my own and the rating given is a reflection based off of my personal interaction with the product.  I keep my reviews fair as I also make my purchasing decisions based off of other's reviews as well and would hate to be led wrong."
4.0,These have a high arch which makes them more supportive.
4.0,"I love these sunglasses. I've been buying these for years. There is no reason to buy sunglasses that are hundreds of dollars when you can get a real decent pair like these. The only reason I did not give this review five stars is because they'd discontinued the style of the previous ones I liked, and I had to find a comparable style, after one failed attempt at getting some others from them."
4.0,I use them over my glasses when riding my motorcycle. Keeps the brightness of the sun out but a little small let's alot of wind in on your eyes.over all am satisfied would recomend
4.0,"Overall, this is a nice top. You can wear it with jeans, or you can dress it up with dress slacks and a long necklace.<br /><br />It's very long- almost completely covering your rear end. It looks alright left loose,(think jeans and boots), but also looks nice tucked in. The decoration on the sleeves is nice, and also went through the wash with no issues. (For now.  I may wash separately later, after extended use).<br /><br />I washed it in a regular load, and then dried on a hanger. The material is chiffon, which seems very nice on the skin.  Because it's not cotton, there is zero stretch. So you need to order based off of correct measurements.  I bought a Large, which is just slightly bigger than I am around the bust (40-41"").  I would *not* recommend sizing down for a snug fit. (An XL would have looked huge, because of the length).<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this shirt, is the neckline.  It could be the fabric, but where the neck and shoulder seams meet, it stands up a bit.. It doesn't lay down on your skin like cotton would. It's not a deal breaker, though."
4.0,"Not as study as what you'll get at David's Bridal, but $12-14 versus $70 can't be beat."
4.0,Given as a gift. Daughter loved it.
4.0,"Super fast delivery for me. Does the job. Havent tested the durability yet so no idea if it breaks. Wont fit a large neck; that could be made better but, it's cheap so its way worth the current design."
4.0,"A little tight, but compression stockings have to be . Solid construction and feel like they will last longer than expected."
4.0,Smaller than expected.  Unique though.
4.0,"Description says suede, but not leather it like suede cloth.  dissapointed with that.  Also had sponge lining which heats after time so have to take them off from time to time to cool feet."
4.0,Come up to high between crotch and waist too big and baggy therr returned them
4.0,"right size, not to much to chose still ok"
4.0,They are the right size for my small ears
4.0,this is a cute shirt. i don't normally wear crop tops so I was a little iffy about it. Its looks small but its really stretchy! i will say it is see through in certain lights so wear a white bra with it.
4.0,"Received quickly, super soft and beautiful."
4.0,Comfortable dress but larger than expected
4.0,Cute but its kind if loose.
4.0,"I love it.  It's a very large ring, you might want to buy a size that will fit your middle finger or pointer finger.  I'm not a small person at 5' 10&#34; tall and this is big on my ring finger.  The stone could be lighter green is the biggest complaint that I have.  It's pretty dark so it's hard to tell that it's dark green.  The ring and scroll work are lovely.  Best as a cocktail ring!"
4.0,super fast shipping with prime. sizes are accurate as far as my order goes.
4.0,I wanted to give you a view of this dress straight from the bag. It's 6-12 months and of course it needs to be steamed pressed. I'm pleased with my purchase even though the color is a little lighter in person than photo used in ad. I have not tried it on my grand daughter yet. She'll be 8 months during the September wedding. I've purchased a backup dress just in case.
4.0,Good quality sunglasses but I did not like the way they looked on me.
4.0,Cool little cover up!!
4.0,Very comfortable. Look nice.  They do run a little small. I ordered one size larger than normal for a great fit
4.0,Ordered XL but received 2XL.  Thought they were going to be too large but to my surprise they fit like I wanted them to.
4.0,Are a decent product you just need to assemble the diaphragms ensuring that the parts are fully locked into place( 2 clicks). They are not suitable for children ( too big) as they won’t seal ( large gap).
4.0,"Got these for 80's concerts, etc.  They'll certainly do."
4.0,Great ring very detailed lots of complaints fast delivery
4.0,Too small but from reviews I know to order a few sizes up. It’s definitely a “fitted” tee but I like it and it washes well.
4.0,"Expected a darker shade, as the picture shows. The belts started to worn off within 3 days. Cheap but working."
4.0,"OK, it looked bigger in Picture"
4.0,Comfortable and lightweight.  This top fits as expected and seems well made. No loose seems or strings.  The color is a lighter picture than pictured but still nice.<br /><br />Hopefully you found this review helpful
4.0,Very good I luv em but shipping wuz kinda stinky they came all messed up but other than that a great item very realistic
4.0,"This was a little small for my daughter,  she normally wears a 14 so i got a 16, and it was tight on the chest,  she is a 36d so i think that's half the problem.  It would have been a great dress had the chest fit a tad better.  It's beautifully made,  the ties in the back are nice and lace up just great and the material is awesome."
4.0,super cute necklace! Especially for the price! Got this for a family member for Christmas. I know they will love it! It sparkles just right in the light. The chain is a bit dainty looking so wouldn't recommend giving to a young person who could easily break it.
4.0,Cute! Fits well.
4.0,Color is more brown than expected
4.0,"Appears to be a good quality shirt, but runs very small so I returned it."
4.0,"I just received this dress and while I will keep it because I like the feel and fit of it, the supposedly orange is more of light red color.  Am disappointed because the picture shows a bright orange and that’s what I wanted.  Oh well....."
4.0,"An attractive Day-of-the-Dead mask, proportioned for the male face. Unlike other masks I found, the design is also suitably masculine. There's two black ribbons attached to each side, to allow different configurations. They must be tied (no clasp).<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, the mask is either upsized from a female mask, or made for a rounder face (wider and shorter) than mine. Tied comfortably, there were two problems: the eyeholes were small enough that my eyelashes hit the edge of the eye holes unless positioned &quot;just right&quot;.  And worse, the nose is cut for a pert little nose, not a big male nose. The sides (of the nose piece) pressed down and restricted my nostrils by half, quickly turning me into a mouth-breather. Similarly, the curved tip of the mask's nose implies a short/small nose. I could doctor the nose area (of the mask, not my face), but I'd worry about damaging the material.<br />Tying the mask more loosely helped with the eyelash situation, but not the nose (since the mask rode lower when looser), and made the mask feel less secure.<br /><br />I've bought hand-made masks in New Orleans before. They tend to either be very flimsy or rather expensive. A well-made mask in this price range is a find, and if you have a shorter/rounder face, this one will probably work for you. Recommended in that case (though I'm returning mine since I like to breathe)."
4.0,"Color is not what is shown, much lighter."
4.0,"The bow came off, it was easy to repair, but she only wore them twice."
4.0,"Pretty happy with the sweater, honestly the zipper could be better though, it's VERY small and cheap, I feel like I have to be extra careful when just zipping up the sweater or it will break off. Other than that, sweater is a little smaller than I thought, but it looks just as described!<br />I knew the belt/shirt look came a part of it, not like out of the sweater, so that was my assumption it would look like that, and I like it.<br />4/5 for quality, zipper could be sturdier"
4.0,"The large bag is extremely roomy, and has a divider and multiple pockets inside for organizing. I liked that a strap was also included if you prefer to not use the shorter handles. You definitely would be able carry quite a few items. There are two smaller bags that match, a wristlet bag and one that would be the perfect size for cosmetics. The medium bag has a zipper. The leather quality seems to be decent though definitely not top of the line leather. The gold accents weren't personally my taste, but others may like them. I did find them to have quite a chemical scent, probably some sort of leather polish. I put them in a safe spot to air, and that seems to be helping. They were shipped from overseas, and well packaged to prevent any damage during transit.<br /><br />I did receive a discount in exchange for providing a honest review."
4.0,Very satifies
4.0,"The shirt is beige, not grey as stated/pictured and the floral design is not quite as pictured. But, it fits well and is a good stretchy/comfortable material."
4.0,"The pendant is very elegant, but a little smaller than I thought...but nice chain length."
4.0,Nice glove. A little big in sizing
4.0,"I've never had an XL dress fit so small!  Beautiful pattern, not quite as long as pictured.  But the fabric has no stretch, and was very tight in the arms, chest, and waist--had to have help to get it off.  Will definitely reorder if the next size up is available!"
4.0,"Affordable boyfriend blazer that adds chic flare to your wardrobe. This is a open front blazer that is pretty basic and does not have any buttons nor are the pockets actually usable. I’m not crazy about the 3/4 bunched sleeves, but it does offer an edge to your style and you also don’t have to worry about the sleeves being too long or too short. I was surprisingly that I don’t feel restricted in the underarm area as I do with most blazers. I order a size small and I am 5’2, 125lbs and the blazer fits me perfect!"
4.0,I did not like that some of the backing had came out.  Other than that it was very nice
4.0,Complete kit for swimming. Purchased as gifts so don't really know how effective they are.
4.0,The shirt did shrink somewhat in first wash and dry laundry . It fits a little more across chest and is about 3/4 inch shorter in length .<br />I usually wear a M but suggest a larger size since quality is not top notch after 1 washing .
4.0,"We loved this ring. The one downside was that the writing was a little hard to read, but otherwise it is a great ring."
4.0,"One of my favorite shirts. Comfortable and aoft, slimming."
4.0,Very nice-great deal for the price
4.0,Well I love flannel! The only thing is there's no tag inside of the back collar so I always have to hold them up to make sure I'm putting it on the right way!
4.0,"Cute , fits well ,however I wish it was a little longer."
4.0,"Great watch band. Cute color. However, a little difficult to put on quickly. The band gets stuck to your skin and you kind of have to wiggle room to get it to go on. Lastly, I’m not sure what they use for the silver colored parts, but my skin started to react to the friction and rub. Now I’ve got this weird skin thing going on. It’s rough, red, and really itchy when it comes to direct contact with the metal part of the band. I end up having to put a transparent adhesive of some kind just to cover my skin and avoid it from rubbing."
4.0,"Bag is very cute!!!! The size is good but it for sure is not large enough for a laptop. It would  fit a small Ipad. The problem I have is that I did not receive My strap as advertised… 【ADJUSTABLE AND REMOVABLE STRAP】This crossbody bag for women has a canvas handle, adjustable and detachable shoulder strap, and a secure top zipper closure. With such a large organized laptop tote bag, it can satisfy all your daily necessities."
4.0,"Great Trench coat, fits me perfect, seems to be of good quality, nicely lined, and love the buttons for detail.  The belt was way too long so will cut it down which will work better for me.  Washing instructions not in English but I remember it said it was machine washable when I ordered it.  Would order again and arrived as expected."
4.0,"Beautiful, they need help with quality Control tho."
4.0,These run VERY small.  I bought a XL for my husband. Turns out they fit my 8 year old son perfectly.
4.0,"Love this shirt. It's flattering, comfortable and a tad bit sexy!"
4.0,"Very cute! I'm 5&#34;0 and 106 pounds, and i ordered a medium. It fits perfectly and arrived quickly!"
4.0,Nice adjustable watch bands.
4.0,"I really like these earrings, the size and shape are perfect! The only complaint is that they are a bit flimsy and seem to bend pretty easily which makes me a little more cautious. Other than that they are great! :)"
4.0,The best of the 3 pair I have
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; 32DD, 150 lbs (or so) short waisted with a hourglass verging on pear shape. I ordered the grey in medium and the orange in large. While both fit I'm keeping the medium and returning the large because the waist hit me slightly higher in the medium and offered slightly better/more flattering camouflage of tummy. The orange was cute and I'll probably get it in the medium as well."
4.0,Cute! Good cheap jewelry.
4.0,"I think the shirt is cute and the quality is nice, but the sizing chart is not accurate. I ordered a medium because the sizing chart said the bust was 47.2&#34;. I measured the medium when I got it, because it was too tight, and the bust measurement was actually just 40&#34;."
4.0,So good.
4.0,Sandals are great so far. I normally wear size 9 but size 9 in these sandals were more like a size 10.
4.0,Quite a difference with these glasses on.  All colors were more brilliant. decent quality frames too. A little dark for in the house wearing all the time. But overall they did seem to work.
4.0,Doesn't fit on my normal size noggin
4.0,Love! Just a little loose wish I ordered a size down. I normally wear a medium in the full pant but noticing the Capri are a bit looser I'm constantly pulling them up I have much more room. Will be ordering more but in a size small!! And I love that they are longer Capri. I'm 140lb waist 26 hips 40
4.0,very nice and comfortable dress
4.0,"These were really great quality for the price. I ordered them for my bridesmaids but they ended up wearing different earrings. I did consider keeping these for myself because the quality was surprisingly really good, but I didn’t need 6 earrings for myself!"
4.0,Good for around the house cover-up.  I use over sleeveless dresses.
4.0,Very attracive watch. my only criticism is the band is a bit stiff.
4.0,"I had written a review before because the pair I had fell apart after a couple of weeks, but the seller contacted me and asked if I would like a refund or another pair since the pair I got was probably defective. I’ve had the new pair for about a week and so far so good!! Hopefully they hold up longer than the previous pair!"
4.0,I like that these are light and thin. Easy to use and comfortable.
4.0,"Masks aren't fun to wear, but at least this one is pretty. The blues are really nice and match most of the blues in my wardrobe. It does ""suck in"" a bit at my nostrils if I breathe in too deeply, but it's not too bad."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but I had to exchange the Medium for a Large. The yellow color is beautiful but the material definitely feels ""cheap"" and it somewhat clingy."
4.0,"They fit well, but have a tendency to move downward at the waist."
4.0,"Super cozy and fuzzy. Seems reasonably well made, and fits true to size. The only thing I don't like about it is that the reindeer are upside down, which doesn't match the pictures, and looks a little ridiculous."
4.0,I like the texture of the cloth but it’s a little jig for my daughter
4.0,"Wallet is compact and looks nice. Took off one star as I had to struggle a bit to insert some of my cards in the slot. However, all of them are in and I use this wallet everyday."
4.0,The goldtone is more rose gold tone
4.0,"Tight in the thighs, but other than that they are nice material."
4.0,It's a cheap watch that works
4.0,Soft but came with a broken snap. I also didn’t realize it snapped instead of buttoned. Since I was looking for a baggy boyfriend fit I ordered an xlarge. Glad I didn’t get my regular size medium as it would not have fit!
4.0,I bought these since the silicone wrist band on my Amazfit GTS 2 mini was sweaty and annoying when I worked out. I wore this blue band since I bought it and in less than a month the seam started coming loose. For $3 each band I would still say it's worth it. I'll admit I'm aggressive when I work out and probably put way more stress on this band than a normal person would. I would not recommend wearing it for swimming as I think the water caused the failure to happen faster. They are super comfortable and sweat on the band doesn't bother me as much as when I wore the original silicone rubber band.
4.0,"I've had this for a while and it's held up really well. Holds a LOT of makeup. Too much, it falls out when open because of the way the front dips down. But great quality, great buy."
4.0,Items looks as  it appears online. It may be a little heavy for delicate fabrics.
4.0,Fun costume necessity for a work project. Quality item and still pull them out from time to time just for fun.
4.0,"A little small and pushy for the jewels but comfortable anyway, if that makes sense. I like the kangaroo pouch ones this brand makes much better. I recommend getting at least one size bigger than you think you need."
4.0,"I was very excited about these rings when I got them I was wanted to try the silicone rings to see how they feel and if I would like them.  Well I definitely do like them they take a little getting used to since I'm used to a metal ring .  Some of the things you should consider are the ring doesn't slide around your finger like a metal Ring will. silicone is also gripping so when driving I noticed that it really stucks to my steering wheel When turning.  It might sound weird but the ring is also a little warm.  The silver ring I think must've had paint on the outside because the paint started wearing off after just a couple of days but the solid silicone rings seem to wear just fine without any problems . Overall I'm very satisfied it's a good solution when working out and working with machinery to protect your hands.  The ring is also very comfortable to wear .  I did receive this product at a reduced price in exchange for a fair and honest review<br />I understand that the 1-5 star rating is to help both buyers and sellers. Here is a breakdown of how my 1-5 ratings are determined:<br /> 5-star rating that means that I truly love that product and it has features that put it above and beyond what would normally be expected, and it is something that “wowed” me and I am truly glad I purchased it and would purchase it again. Also I recommend it to everyone and anyone!<br /><br />4-star ratings are items that do exactly as would be expected of the item, is of very good quality, but does not stand out significantly in any way unless I specifically state why it stands out. But all in all, this item is a solid item and is still highly recommended. It just didn’t have the wow factor that my 5 star ratings would have had.<br />3-star ratings are given on items because my feeling about the product is neutral. I do not consider it a negative, but it just did not wow me, or there is nothing of great significance.<br />1 or 2-star ratings are rarely given unless the item is completely worthless and not worth the money, and I am only giving that rating as a warning to others. Some items have received lower ratings because of the way they were made or put together, and it is getting that review because of the quality of the item, which is specifically described in my review. It has to be pretty bad to get these ratings from me!"
4.0,"The colors of the three different CZ's are deeper than they appear in the illustration; so I was a little surprised.  My wife doesn't like things too flashy.  The colors are red, purple and a lime green.  Mounting seems to be well made and with a nice finish.  The bracelet is a little longer than 7 inches. It measures 7 1/4 including the clasp in closed position as if you were wearing it.  Received in just a little drawstring bag."
4.0,Design very cool.  Zipper pull broke first wearing.
4.0,"Very cute outfit, will use it for family pictures"
4.0,"I have been on a quest for many years to find a decent vegan belt. My criteria is simple; it must be suitable for wearing in an office, fit well, and not fall apart within the first few months of use. While this belt is not perfect, it is the closest I have found to checking all those boxes. I have worn 'flex' belts in the past, and generally found them annoying - but after trying non-leather belts from numerous other companies and having them all fall apart after a short time, I was willing to try anything.<br />This belt is well made, reasonably good looking, and fits well. As other reviewers have mentioned, the 'stretchiness' of this belt allows it to accommodate a variety of sizes without having extra holes in the loop, In fact, it has no dedicated holes for the buckle at all - you wrap the belt around your waist to the point where it feels comfortable and hook the buckle into the weave of the belt. This may take some getting used to, as the belt is so stretchy that it is easy to make it too tight - but after wearing it once or twice most people will get the hang of it. The only downside of this belt, and the reason I am dinging it a star, is that the end of the belt is covered by a piece of material (pleather?) that forms a sort of bulb. This end can be hard to fit through some belt loops - making it unusable with some pants. I have many pairs of Docker-style pants - this belt fits well with some and does not work at all with others. If the manufacturer fixed this problem this belt would be just about perfect for me."
4.0,"Exactly what I was expecting. Fur is a little flat unless mussed, but overall looks great."
4.0,"I bought this to keep training Jiu Jitsu, which of course is a full contact sport. I like that the mask keeps away from my nose and mouth, which allows for easier breathing while doing hard work.<br /><br />It does run a bit smaller than I thought. I got the large, and it is small for my face, so whatever size you think you need, maybe order one size up."
4.0,"This is a pair of jeans with lots of wool content. The fabric is 66% wool, 29% cotton, 5% elastane in a flat thin weave. The waistband is elastic with plenty of stretch. The pants have 4 pockets, 2 medium length in the front (large enough for a hand but not a phone), a zipped pocket in the back right, and an open pocket in the back left. The front closure has double metal buttons over a zippered fly. The knees are articulated, and the calves are cut very, very tight. Washing instructions say machine wash. The jeans were made in China.<br /><br />I find the fabric of these jeans quite soft and comfortable on my skin. The pants are quite thin, though, so even though they are made of wool, they are too thin to be warm, except as base layer under something else. I find the calves exceptionally tight. They barely accommodate my wool knee socks underneath, and I don’t have large calves. I am 5’2”, 115 lbs. I usually wear size 6/8 pants. These pants in size 6 fit me well around the waist, but the tight calves will take some getting used to. Overall, these jeans are attractive but too thin to wear on their own for cold days and may not fit every body type."
4.0,"I am 5’6” and 130ish pounds. I generally wear a size medium in US sizes, so I order this qipao dress in a size large (I did measure myself and use the sizing guide before ordering.). The length is right, but the bust is quite tight, and I wasn’t able to zip the last one inch. The zipper is under my arm so this doesn’t even show, and I am still comfortable wearing it. I ordered the fuschia and the color matches the picture in the product description. This dress is absolutely beautiful, and if I order any other dresses from this seller, I will go two sizes up and hope the rest of the bodice is not too big.<br /><br />The fabric is polyester, the colors are vibrant and the print is beautiful. The zipper works well. There are high slits on both sides that make this otherwise modest dress quite sexy, as well as making it possible to walk comfortably. The fabric is unlined but I don’t feel like it is see-through. I feel really pretty and elegant in this dress.<br /><br />I received this qipao for free in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not obligated to write a favorable review. I have worn this product myself, and all words in this review are my own."
4.0,My only problem is the zipper. It gets stuck when it reaches the top
4.0,The glasses are very sturdy. The lenses are clear and the polaroid feature is solid.
4.0,these were a great color and comfy but too big... nike trainerrs have a tendency of being too small or too large. had to return them.
4.0,"These are really comfortable. The shrunk in the wash a bit, so where as a medium is usually comfortably loose these fit correctly. They are very cute and are really great quality. Just buy a size up if you were trying to buy loose underwear for whatever reason."
4.0,"Very beautiful. It is a bit on the large size, but all in all a lovely pair of earrings"
4.0,For the price this is fabulous!
4.0,"Love this color and texture band, it goes with everything."
4.0,tight and thinner fabric than expected
4.0,"I bought these for my ten year old son.  He loves them.  They fit well and he said that they are very comfortable.<br />The only thing that we were  a little disappointed about was the fact the the American flag one said ""July 4""  really big on one side.  That wasn't in the picture or description.  Regardless, he still wears it to school and for sports."
4.0,Good quality stitching. I haven't tried ironing it on yet so I can't say about the glue. Pay close attention to the measurements because this was smaller than I thought it would be.
4.0,I really love how this swimsuit provides coverage. It fits well. The only complaint that I have is that the shorts ride up constantly.
4.0,Very sparkly in the light and goes with everything!
4.0,"Good quality. Serves its purpose. Face mask is lil difficult to put in place, but doesn't fall off or anything."
4.0,"To give you a brief idea what I deal with (in case you have similar issues):  plantar fasciitis left foot, collapsing arches both, overpronation on left foot, hammer toe on both.  If you also experience one or more of these, read on to see if these are a good fit for you!<br /><br />To start with, the sole is certainly thicker than a cheap sandal but I wouldn't compare it to ""walking on clouds"". These are slightly thicker than a traditional food bed sandal.  That said, they are certainly more comfortable and are a nice break from work shoes.<br /><br />These are waterproof and can certainly be worn indoors or outdoors but take care with the bottom of the soles.  There are grooves so it's not perfectly smooth but it is not a ""rugged"" bottom and you will definitely slip if on a slick surface.  There is some grip but not much.<br /><br />These do have a slight arch support but it is by no means comparable to orthodics.  In a pinch these can help but prolonged use might not be beneficial.  However, I am NOT a doctor and only giving my opinion based upon my own experience.<br /><br />The fit of these I would say run almost a little wide.  If you are narrow-footed or even ""regular"" and don't have any underlying issues, these may not be for you.<br /><br />How do these work for my various problems?<br /><br />- plantar fasciitis:  I've noticed a decrease in pain since wearing these versus my old sandals.  The heel is certainly comfortable and I don't find myself gripping these like other sandals so that muscle is not becoming as tight.<br /><br />- collapsing arches:  as stated above, there is some arch support but it is not the level you receive from orthodic inserts.  These definitely are a step above (pun intended) flat sandals but again, prolonged use might not work out.<br /><br />--overpronation:  similar with above, the arch support helps but does not in any away correct this.<br /><br />--hammer toe:  this is where the wide part actually works.  With the band being slightly wider, you do not have the discomfort you would normally get in certain footbed sandals.  There is now ample room to accomodate the change in foot shape.<br /><br />In short, these are nice for short periods at home but I wouldn't use for longer wear unless your feet are in tip-top shape."
4.0,"I wore this shirt for work and to the movies the other day, and it was perfectly comfortable for extended wear. Though it's polyester and spandex, it feels like a slightly rough cotton. As far as sizing, it seemed accurate; I'm right between sizes and went with the smaller one. It fit and hung well when I was standing, though it was a little tight at the belly, dependinig on how I was sitting."
4.0,Really like this dress. 4 stars vs 5 because the fabric has a little sheen that makes it feel a bit cheap. But it’s super cute.
4.0,fun to change colors
4.0,"I should stop wearing fake glasses, but I LOVE them!"
4.0,"Little tight around the waist, but l like it."
4.0,First this is very inexpensive and is somewhat dependent on the battery that you use so I am considering those things in this review. First the XL is a snug American Medium as noted. The vest is fairly well made. My negatives are the placement of the heat elements is different than the image. I chose this one because it appeared that the heat elements where placed higher in the front and not at pocket level where it would heat the battery. This is not the case. The amount of heat output is low but about what I expected. The heat produced by the battery when operating is equal or greater than the heating elements. Still it does what I need when worn under a Jacket.
4.0,Good but a little too big
4.0,I bought this pendant as a gift. Pendant looks as displayed in the image. Overall looks good.
4.0,"Very bright and colorful, love the designs!"
4.0,Not bad just think it should have been cheaper
4.0,"The DASH Co. RFID Extra Capacity Bifold Passcase Men's Wallet isn't just for men.  It is a classic looking wallet that can be used by women too who prefer a simpler style.  The wallet is made of a synthetic leather canvas material and is of durable quality.  The billfold compartment of the wallet has a divider so you can separate money for bills and fun.  The card slots have an opening behind them for many cards, I was able to fit 28 cards in the wallet.  It was too chunky for a pocket at that point, but for the person who only carries a small amount of cards it would fit in a pocket nicely.  The wallet did arrive in an attractive gift box, my mother even tried to walk off with it.  I did not have a way to test out the RFID protection embedded in the material.  I did receive a discount on the DASH Co. RFID Extra Capacity Bifold Passcase Men's Wallet."
4.0,Nice jacket. The actual color seemed a bit different from the picture. Wasn’t exactly as I thought.
4.0,Not cotton but I didn’t read description too closely.  Not terrible overall but he just prefers cotton blends.
4.0,"They are Christmas gifts , so only thing I can say is they look nice and shipped quickly.  Will update post after Christmas."
4.0,Love the product.  Order black.  Then ordered wine and navy.
4.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding and i was 5 months pregnant at the time, showing quite a bit. I read that this dress was stretchy, used my bust measurement and crossed my fingers for the waist since i no longer have one! It was great! It looked so good, hugged my hips and chest and growing belly nicely.  The only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is because the seam was sewn messed up in one part. There was a hole. But i hand stitched it quick with some navy thread and its just fine. Cant even tell."
4.0,Great watch for thise with nickel allergies.  Love it till I broke it.  Big falls on concrete will break glass.
4.0,"Does fit well on my face, but I still like them"
4.0,It is okay wallet.
4.0,"Very cute, has a mini funnel, for very fine ashes only.."
4.0,Very cute but not made for girls with curves. Had to return it.
4.0,This coat was for my grandaughter.  She loved it but size ordered was a little too tight.  We will be returning the coat for a bigger size.
4.0,Nice shoes...comfortable...but would like to see a little more from the vendor on the wiring of the shoes. Wires give out on the LED's after wearing the shoes during normal walking in about 4 days. Would like to see the vendor move the IR sensor on the outside of the shoe some where near the top of the shoe where you do not need to lift you pants to get to the sensor.
4.0,"Great shooting glasses, they fit well with hearing protection.  The color works well at the indoor ranges I go to.  Overall a great buy."
4.0,Very comfy! A little snug for me but a long shirt you don’t notice. Maybe should have gotten a large but I always buy small and medium was a tad tight for work attire !
4.0,"Very attractive, well made, took it down to about 30 feet under water for more than an hour with no issues. Band might be short for some but fine for me."
4.0,I bought a bunch of these for my wife and she wears them to work.
4.0,"I order it (S) l and it came (L) but is nice, not a big problem"
4.0,"Pretty good quality for a bag costume. Comes with dress and bow headband. Length is good and fit is pretty decent. A bit tight in the arms. I ordered the largest size, but would have gotten a size up if I could have. Still fit well enough to wear on Halloween."
4.0,"This set includes two adorable rompers with really cute designs. The actual designs make the outside of these rompers a little rough, but don't worry, the u deride of the rompers are very soft and soft on the skin.<br /><br />Both rompers have snaps at the crotch area for easy changing. There are no snaps or fold over opening at the neck, the material at the neck does not stretch very easily and this makes it a little tough to pull over our little guy's head.<br /><br />Another thing that we noticed, is the width of the romper is very wide. Works great for those chubby little guys.<br /><br />The material is different for each romper. The elephant romper is made of heavier material. The banana romper is made of a softer and lighter weight material.<br /><br />Bottom line, they are nice, cute rompers that are made well except for the top opening. I am concerned with the elephant romper. With the head opening so small, not stretchy enough and not having snaps, I don’t think that one will be use<br /><br />Both rompers are very cute and will wash well due to being Poly/Cotton. They are machine washable and can be tumble dry.<br /><br />Summary:<br />(1) 60% cotton 40% polyester<br />(2) Imported<br />(3) An Amazon Brand<br />(4) Machine Wash<br />(5) 2-piece set featuring two short sleeves rompers<br />(6) Snap closure for easy changes"
4.0,Needed this mask for a masquerade prom.  The mask was comfortable and loved the look of it.  Recommend it to anyone who needs a masquerade mask.
4.0,was a perfect  graduation gift
4.0,Was for the wife. She loved it.
4.0,I'm excited to purchase more colors in this top. I had to adjust it a few times during the day so that the draping was to my liking. But other than that I love it
4.0,"NICE,BUT CANT REALLY ROLL IT UP WITTHOUT BENDING THE WIRE IN THE BRIM EACH TIME."
4.0,wife approved
4.0,It was a gift for my sister for her first child. She sent me a picture. The only thing I was disappointed with was the pendant was a bit smaller then I thought but she likes it.
4.0,Ordered these glasses in a 1.25+.  Although the exterior of the package was labeled correctly the individual glasses inside the clear plastic bag were all 1.50+.  Otherwise cute and just what I wanted.
4.0,"Fit very comfortable, SLIGHTLY sheer but only enough to create a nice sheen of flesh tone underneath, doesn't look cheap and seems sturdy enough. My only complaint is that there is weird stitching/seams or something that go down part of the legs, almost look like black dots that connect. It shouldn't be noticeable when you wear it and it's not all over the leg, just certain places, but I noticed it when putting them on. Not worth the trouble of exchanging or returning so I'm just sticking with them, but it's definitely a bit odd and not ideal. Hoping no one else notices and that they hold up well when I wear them!"
4.0,"Very pretty in the light.  Doesn't look exactly like pictures, but for the price I would order more."
4.0,"I live in Michigan, and so now we have an order that we must wear a mask when going into a retail place of business.  I have avoided as much as possible wearing a mask.  But I have no desire to break the law, and unless it starts to become a thing, I will follow the rules.<br />But I am not happy about it, and the Empress of Lansing just told us that she is extending it into at least September.  So I am glad that I bought one for both my wife and my self.  They work quite well, and they recognized as following the rules.  Again, a good product from a good company.  My thanks to you."
4.0,"I needed the extra arm length -- so I ordered the next larger size - but it seems a little large. I have received many compliments on it though. I would have preferred it to be removable though. Very warm -- very nice, and I love the color."
4.0,"I do like it, however I ordered a 2x which is what I normally wear and it's way tooo big. the fabric is awesome though and lightweight I like that. It is so comfy I will still wear it"
4.0,The material is a little thin but I put a tank top underneath and it was fine.
4.0,"Had to return them because they were a little too big! Loved the shoe though, super cute!"
4.0,I like the soft /non wrinkle fabric as a face mask and when the weather changes it will be a nice addition for<br />warming face and neck
4.0,This band fit my watch and is comfortable
4.0,These are very cute.  My mom loved them.
4.0,"Great product, good price, deliver on time."
4.0,This is a good quality butcher's coat. It's well made with quality materials and washes well with no shrinking or wrinkling if removed right out of the dryer. It's true to size and comfortable.
4.0,"Nice material, just did not like them as well as another pair I bought"
4.0,"Very cute and well made.  Perfect size for my 1.5 year old (2 inches).  However, one of the reasons I bought this lot was because of the teal color shown in the pictures.  I did not receive a teal bow in the bag, rather 2 different shades of navy.  That's a disappointment.  Otherwise, I am happy with them."
4.0,"I liked the look of these pj’s, but the top was too small."
4.0,I bought these sight unseen. My daughter was impreased with the quality.
4.0,"Image perfect, material soft, runs at least one size small."
4.0,I'm a PLL fan so I just and to get this bracelet. The charms are smaller than I expected but it's okay.
4.0,A little thin but over all nice
4.0,"Fits great, one of my favorite dresses."
4.0,These r cute.. Lil pokey took some getting used to but we'll worth it. Very cute...<br />Recieved this item discounted for my review.
4.0,"Product is cute, however, way too big."
4.0,I love the color! But I end tips gets stuck in my hair quite a bit.
4.0,"Over-size style with unfinished edges but decent quality.  Middle school girl loves it with a black tank and black, pleated skort with tall socks or leggings.  Not sure how it will hold up to washing but she's past the younger kid phase of trashing her clothing and will take care of it.<br /><br />This was on a gift wish list.  I had no clue until it was pointed out this was a reference to a movie we'd seen, very cute."
4.0,"This was a good product, I enjoy the craftman ship and the cost was very minimal. I would use them again."
4.0,Super cure dress. Really fun but can also be dressed up. Not see through.
4.0,50th bday party
4.0,"cheap... and a little cheap looking, but it works with a few things and I paid less than a dollar...so it's a win win.  everything came perfectly. Nothing missing. Nothing torn, nothing removed.  so... I'm good with this purchase."
4.0,"They work great for exercise.  They come up high however, so they ride up easily.  But who cares when you use them to work out?"
4.0,Purchased as a gift for my Dad to display grandfather's pocket watch. He loves it - simple and a nice showcase for the watch.
4.0,Pretty ring. I bought one size up and it fits.
4.0,the color is not the navy i thought. they are more purple. but still.............i will buy a purple sweater and have a perfect outfit. nice size and just what i love.
4.0,"A little delicate, but very nice accessory. Good for the price."
4.0,My 4 year old is average for height and weight and this leotard is a little snug out of the package.
4.0,"Nice dress, but I had to return. Too small."
4.0,"Great Quality, Great Look. Just runs alittle small."
4.0,Looks good but the arms are to small
4.0,"I'm size small , 5 feet tall and it fit me perfectly fine ! It is very beautiful and the quality is not too bad , it's okay for the price 👍🏼"
4.0,"This onesie is HUGE!! I’m rather petite and my mom had to alter it everywhere so it would fit, and I ordered an xs. However, it’s extremely comfortable, vibrant, and warm, and is perfect for my halloween costume. I would definitely buy another one in a different color at some point, as long as I have access to a seamstress. :)"
4.0,"Unfortunately received a faulty watch the first time around. After seeing my review Aurora contacted me and sent a replacement straight away. Very convenient and quick to fix the issue, great stuff!"
4.0,"I ordered a Large, they were a little smaller than I expected but very nice."
4.0,"I bought this ring for myself because I like to mix my gold and silver jewelry. It is very beautiful to look at and is nice and shiny. It does, however, run a little small so I wasn't able to wear it on the finger that I intended and didn't want to try to exchange it. I will have to see how it holds up over the long term but it looks very nice on my hand right now and looks good with my other rings."
4.0,The watch looks perfect... but the strap feels and look cheap... i will replace the original for another one that looks more expensive like the watch.
4.0,"This is a really cute ring. It is well made and looks good but definitely looks like costume jewelry to the trained eye. It is just a little too shiny. I wear it with my other David Yurman jewelry and it mixes in well. I recommend purchasing, just know that it is not perfect. 4 stars"
4.0,Beautiful vegan gloves but they did not keep my hands warm in Washington DC in January.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Stylish!<br />+ Vegan!<br />+ Touchscreen capable for all your fingers and other parts of your hand!<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not warm during the Washington DC winter<br />- Snugger than expected. I bought a medium and it was a tight fit for my hands.
4.0,The dress was pretty. The only thing that it fit kinda awkward on me. It was tight on the bottom and big on top. Otherwise very nice. The seller was awesome and very understanding with the situation. Great communcation... Took off a star because it didnt fit me.
4.0,"To awhile a couple weeks, shipped from over seas. Nice quality product though."
4.0,I like the material but order a next size up for a more comfort fit.
4.0,"Nice and detailed,  but very fragile."
4.0,"Love the gloves, nice and warm."
4.0,"Great belt as described. However, sizing could be problematic.  This is in regard to the belt I received, not yours. So if yours is different, good for you.  I ordered a medium, which is supposed to fit up to. 38 inch waist.  No way.  I wear a 36 inch pants. That's a standard off the shelf Levi's regular fit size 36.  All of my other pants are 36 as well.  This belt barely fit me. After threading it through the buckle, there is only about 2 inches left.  If I were a 38 that wouldn't be enough to thread it through and snug it tight.  I didn't buy the next size up and cut it, because why should I?"
4.0,"The only reason for four stars rather than 5 is the stone colors don't correspond 100% to the birthstone months. There are a 2 pale blue and and 1 pale purple stones, which don't fit any specific month.  I'd like more saturated colored stones. Other than that, the overall quality is good. The stones are substantial weight, pretty, and sparkle nicely."
4.0,Cool graphics. Like look!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:24c5c3b924e6a623a66c6553da01eb2c]] This is too is cute, the quality is sufficient it’s made really well, it’s the size I expected when I ordered it. Its darn cute! I feel like the fabric is slightly cheap but that’s expected considering this product is affordable. The colors in the heart is vibrant. I have a feeling it will tarnish in the wash over time, but most graphical designs do, so no worries there. There was no creases in the printed design after shipping, always love that~!! It’s warm, it’s comfy, I don’t feel akward wearing it, and I don’t feel uncomfortable wearing it either. A solid 4 star~ ✨"
4.0,"I kepted it, I wanted black."
4.0,"Item came as expected. Rayon material, drapes nicely."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:a9f5fa12aa125850e6f5de41fdde03fc]] These pants are cutttteee. They hid my little fupa lol. I got tons of compliments while wearing them. Im 5’4 &195lbs & I got a size xl. I wish I got a size large. These pants are long. I wore them with heels & they were still touching the floor.
4.0,"For what I paid, it's fine."
4.0,I like this band but it is very hard to latch and unlatch
4.0,"Beautiful gown, rich color. Worth it!"
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): First off, the print on this dress is simply beautiful.  The ""navy blue"" is more of a royal blue, and the flowers are vibrant and colorful.  The fabric is soft, stretchy and forgiving.  I am 5'5"" and the length is not too long, it's just right.  The cut is feminine and flattering.  My only complaint is that the top comes open a bit too much."
4.0,Works well for what I bought them for
4.0,"Incredibly comfortable material - it barely feels like I'm wearing socks, the thin wool is very breathable. The product came attached to one of those cardboard hangers and looked like it had been opened but I'm assuming this is a packaging flaw. Also, the seams around the toe are a little uncomfortable, nice as it is to have that 'big toe pocket.' Overall I'm quite satisfied with the product, I still can't believe how breathable the material is. Hopefully I can get used to the unusual seams."
4.0,"This dress was cute and it fit well, except for the shoulder straps. They were too short so it was tight on my shoulders. Would have been better if the straps were adjustable, like bra straps. Other than that, the dress fit perfect."
4.0,"It was super cute! Huge knit baggy sleeves. People said I looked like Winnie the Poo (in a cute way, not a fat honey-gorging bear kind of way). It has no real form or structure, even on the cuffs or edges, definitely a lazy/cozy sweater."
4.0,Love the band - I wanted a magnetic one because I felt like the original band to my watch was either too loose or too tight... Works well.. Gets dirty quickly and now (after months of daily use) I find it is starting to snag on some of my long sleeved shirts and sweaters..
4.0,"This fit perfect. My only issue is I got the black one but it game out with like a dark green tint to it. Also if you where it when it is windy the front will open up completely due to where the slit is. But I like it enough, I will definitely wear it again."
4.0,"love it, the fitting is as expected, it looks as pretty as is showed in the picture."
4.0,"Hard to see out of, and it got hot, and breathing out of it was a challenge."
4.0,No complaints. Fits well. Husband is happy.
4.0,The back is way shorter then the front. It isnt long enough.
4.0,"The search for perfect cropped exercise pants with pockets continues. I do like these, quite a bit. The high waist is very comfy and flattering, the length is great (I'm short so they aren't very cropped but I'm used to that). The fabric is thick and not see-through.<br /><br />The fabric, though, is kind of tough, almost rubbery feeling. The thing I really dislike about these is the dye that was used smells kinda funky and also, is still running in the wash after at least 10 times through the laundry cycle. I know we're supposed to separate lights/darks, but I washed these with a couple lighter colored tees (one bright yellow, one blue) and both of those shirts came out really stained, and a murky version of their original colors.<br /><br />Also, the seam inside the thigh on one pair is coming undone :(  I've had them less than a month so this is disappointing.<br /><br />The pros (including BIG pockets to hold my giant iPhone, ha) do outweigh the bad. So if you do buy these in black, make sure you wash them separately!"
4.0,"I liked the style and fit of these glasses.  However, the magnification wasn't right for me."
4.0,"was a little tighter than expected, but very cute and good quality"
4.0,A little thinner and stiff than expected but all in all a good value
4.0,I love this belly ring it is so pretty only problem I had was the ball WS stuck on and took me a very long time to gt it unstuck
4.0,I like the material (jersey type) and it fit losely as described. I may order another color. Definitely glad I purchased it.
4.0,Good qiality for the price. Does fit a bit larger than i expected but i can add a layer under it.
4.0,Good! I'm wearing this but it's too thin for a working socks. I have to wear another one on top of it before wearing my work shoes. It's perfect wearing snicker though. Received it on time.
4.0,"I used this while cross country skiing, windchill was 9 degrees (F) and it kept me toasty and warm (even took it off from getting too warm). Loved that I could wear my hair in a high bun, and still a comfortable loose fit around my face .Liked how I could pull the face mask down to expose my mouth during heavy exertion. Obviously with fleece, it does get wet if you sweat as its not a wicking material. I will more than likely purchase another one! Feel that this is a ""unisex"" size and would fit a majority of adults/teens."
4.0,My son loves these but they did rip from the bottom lace hole after 2 months of daily use
4.0,"As reference 5'5"" 160, ordered a large. It hangs. Size down."
4.0,Nice top - just if you have curves then order a size up.
4.0,"I'd say this is best used to take along when you want something light weight just to have a rain jacket handy.<br /><br />Size (2X) is adequate if a bit tight across the chest.  it would not fit with anything heavy like an insulated vest or such so it's best for warmer weather or people at least one size smaller.<br /><br />Jacket is supposed to fit inside its own pocket but comes with no instructions and I don't feel like playing origami games to figure it out.<br /><br />Quality has me a bit dubious as you can see what look like tiny pinholes in the fabric here and there that might pass water through.  Also, the zipper runs raggedly and hangs up after only a couple of trips so I wonder at the durability of this.<br /><br />On the plus side:  There is one zippered pocket so you won;t lose things and in it is a small lanyard and clip for your keys.  A nice touch.  (Two pockets overall.)  Sleeve length is good ( have long arms) and the fabric has a nice sheen to it, if it stands up to wear.  It is *very* light polyester.<br /><br />I live in a rainy part of the country so as soon as I need to go out in the rain I'll update on how well it handles *that*.  (Using an umbrella here labels you as a tourist.)  Not suitable by itself for cold weather as there is no lining or insulation, which is fine, it is not sold as cold weather gear.<br /><br />Usage Update:<br />November 2021 - This gets light use.  Mostly as a pack along spare.  It is holding up much better than I expected. No sign of wear or tear.  It will soak through in anything above moderate rain and is not going to work for a long day's jaunt but will give modest protection when caught by surprise."
4.0,"Very cute bag, small. I use it for a camera lens. Don't buy if you're looking for a lot of space. The strap was much shorter than I'd hoped."
4.0,"Kids loved them, but they break easily.  2 in the box didn't work at all."
4.0,Good product and great value
4.0,Product was delivered ahead of estimated time and work great.
4.0,Super cute. I've bought other dresses from this company. Always get lots of compliments.
4.0,"Light, strong and Beautiful earrings. The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is due to the backers provided are to big and difficult to put through the wire hook. I used a set of backers from another set, but I lost one due to these wire hooks being much thinner. Back to using the original backers which show."
4.0,"This was a birthday gift for a co-worker. I like the necklace. Looks nice and was what I expected, however I thought it was coming in a little gift box."
4.0,"This is a cheap watch, but it's not a piece of junk. That's what it is, and it is just that to near perfection. It tells time, has an alarm, and a stopwatch. That's what it does, and it does all of those perfectly well.<br /><br />I wanted a watch I wouldn't have to worry or care about scratching or messing up. This watch fits that bill to the T."
4.0,"I have only had the lanyard for a couple of day, but it seems to be made really well. The material is made of a stretchy fabric, and the pictures show up nicely on it."
4.0,They are very soft!
4.0,I purchased these for my daughter for prom.  She fell in love with them.  They are rather large (just what she wanted).  Maybe 4 inches long.  They are heavy but they caught the light beautifully and looked gorgeous on her.  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they were so heavy.  Other than that they were exactly what she wanted.
4.0,Dress looked nice online. I ordered a 14. Only thing i don't like is it's not below the knee.
4.0,Just as described and fits perfectly.
4.0,I took the XL when the L was out of stock. The shorts are a little loose as I expected but can still be used. My grandson was very pleased on how comfortable they are when riding his bike.
4.0,I like the colors and design but they are a little thin. I love the large size.
4.0,"The ankle area is tighter than I expected, which made them hard to get on. Learned they were much easier to get on if instead of trying to stretch the ankle with my fingers, I just stretched the sock out until the tight point, then used my toes as a wedge. Very comfortable. Can wear them all day."
4.0,I bought this same Backpack at Bealls and it's soooooo not worth $56! let alone the $22 i spent for it! the zipper is very cheap it broke in less than a week. I would recommend it cause it's cute but u gotta be careful with the zipper.
4.0,Cheaply made but they are cheap!
4.0,The dress is great  al lip type tight so I would go a size up for the perfect fit!
4.0,"Nice big, leather bag."
4.0,"I like it quite a bit, very practical and exactly what I wanted. I put it over a warm jacket and it's working great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the sleeves could be a little bit longer or at least I would prefer it that way."
4.0,"My little brother got me a pair of these for Christmas. The ends are very rounded, almost bulbous, for the 6g. I'm not sure I'm thrilled with the appearance of them at the smaller size. They almost look girly. However, after wearing them for a couple of weeks, they've grown on me.<br /><br />Definitely good quality for the price, just wasn't sold on the girly appearance at first."
4.0,It's a solid wallet but Is bigger than I expected
4.0,"Cute.... but Super long!!! Fits someone who stands 5’9, 5’10"
4.0,I got this last year I really liked it I still wear it
4.0,I am 5’7 and 145lbs. I usually wear a size medium but I heard the dress is made kinda small so I got a large. The large fits great! Any smaller and the arms would have been too tight. The elastic doesn’t stretch as far as anticipated so I’d go up a size.
4.0,Too big for my 7 year old. I've worn it and got quite a fiew compliments
4.0,I am going on a 2 week visit home and this wallet is perfect. Fits my cards and paper money very well. I am satisfied.
4.0,Under skirt a little too short to be modest. I had to lengthen!
4.0,To big for my 2 1/2 yr old.
4.0,"Good shoe for the price and comfortable to walk in too.  I haven't taken a long ride in them yet, however there are plenty of adjustment points that should relieve any pressure points."
4.0,"My Halloween costume was epic. The Brony costume was complete with this purchase. My only problem with the pants is if you wear boxers or boxer briefs, you'll have no problem showing off the size of your penis. When Free Willy is minding his own business, he is outlined by the fabric due to it's nature to cling and fall without any stiffness. I'm pretty sure that my mother in law is scarred for life while my wife was pleased with the pants. To avoid having two tails at the Halloween party for ladies to grab, I wore a pair of running shorts under the pants to help with the padding issue."
4.0,Worked as advertised with occasional jams but better than hand shuffling.  However the operating wheels rough up the edges of the playing cards causing the cards to wear easily and eventually start sticking together.  Suggest purchasing the multi deck pack if you like more slippery cards to sort in your hand.
4.0,"IT is a cute nice shirt, but it is 100% cotton and shrinks in the wash. Ordered a men’s small for my normal women’s size medium and wish I had gotten the medium instead. It is very tight after washing and drying. Wish I had read the % of cotton. That always shrinks."
4.0,"If it was a bit longer, I'd buy another. Didn't fit my wrist so, I won't."
4.0,"I really love my new ring .<br />I am so happy with it and the price .<br />love the color in the stone , i will be getting my mom one real soon."
4.0,"They were cute, comfy and well made, just not my style. Returned."
4.0,Wish I can see deper  than 5’  but overall good product
4.0,Very comfortable. Only gave it 4 stars cuz I really dislike all bras. Ha
4.0,"Product is very lightweight and comfortable. I thought the material was real bangles and wasnt sure it would fit right. Item is fun to wear, comfortable and at a great price for all that comes with the order."
4.0,It is very flattering but too small to be able to move freely in or walk.
4.0,Sizing: 5'4 / 125lbs / medium was pretty tight. I normally wear a small or medium in leggings but these were pretty small. They do stretch easily so I was able to get them on and they weren't too binding but they are very thin. They feel more like thick tights then leggings. I am going to give these to my 10 year old niece.
4.0,Fits my arm very well. Is long enough for a regular shirt sleeve. I wear one just to cover my tattoos. It's thin and cooling. Doesn't slide down unless you have worn it for a few weeks then needs to be washed.
4.0,"Super cute, great price but on the large side"
4.0,"Excellent value for the money!<br />Fingers are a little long, but maybe my husband has short fingers!"
4.0,"This strap is quite nice. It seems very durable and well made, and fits pretty well. I have a large wrist and some of the edges on the strap rub my wrist in a weird way. The strap is thick, and it makes it feel too big for me. I'm going to return it because of the rough edges and the rubbing if it doesn't start to feel better in a day or two."
4.0,"I thought for sure I was returning this because It was accidentally ordered.<br />This crystal is a large paperweight. I think its acrylic and not glass, not so good as a sun-catcher but all the great  colors<br />are within it. Light can not pass thru and reflect as real crystals do because of a solid coat of paint is covering the underside.<br />I gave it as a gift after all,instead of returning. The seller was responding to my e-mails to make it arrive faster.  and a very good deal, just not what i wanted."
4.0,Very cute but fit big.
4.0,Used for exercises.  Worked as expected
4.0,"My grandson will receive them on x-mas, I am sure he will like them."
4.0,Very nice dress fit just fine. I'm 5'8 and it was perfect.
4.0,"I really like this tank HOWEVER the vendor should consider revamping the &#34;size chart&#34;!  I had to buy an XL and I wear a Small or Medium in everything else.  The XL fit nicely, not tight and not extremely loose, either.  But if you see their size chart is indicates that an &#34;S&#34; is 0-2, a &#34;M&#34; is 4, a &#34;L&#34; is 6 and an XL is 8.  This is SOOOOOO far off of anyone else's size charts that it is ridiculous!!  Usually, when the sizes are not exact but only S, M, L, etc.,  the charts run like this:<br />XS: 0-2<br />S: 4-6<br />M: 8-10<br />XL: 12-14<br />XXL:  16-18"
4.0,I didn't expect much but it's of good quality - the are some reviewers who have said the collar is folded and bent... this is very true. I'm going to try to bend it the other way to see if it straightens out. I'm not going to give this 5 stars as I wish the collar wasn't so bent. But the tail and earpiece are great!
4.0,is good stuff not bad i like it good price i think you can do it better
4.0,Watch face is nice in size. Features are great.<br />Voice has an accent that is hard to understand sometimes<br />Band is large and not adjustable
4.0,"The first time I put on the mask, one of the knots pulled through the little hole, and the string hung loose from one side.  I tied the knot larger, and now it's fine.  Other than that, I'm happy.  Shipped and arrived quickly, and will suit my purpose."
4.0,I've ordered a lot of bathing suits online and this is by far the best quality one I've gotten for this price. I'm a busty and chunky girl and the XXL fits perfect. The only negative thing is that it came with some weird staining on the top piece. But I'm too lazy to return it so I'll just say my kids smeared something on me. Otherwise it's a great bathing suit.
4.0,"It was much smaller than I had expected. I fell for how lovely it looked in the picture and probably didn’t read the description properly.<br />When it arrived, it was a surprise with its 10 mm small Rose Quarts bead and the chain was very slim to match. Still it is a beautiful necklace, very well designed with all details proportional to one another. It is an excellent size necklace for a young girl, but way too tiny for a fully grown woman."
4.0,Long from shoulder to waist for me... I actually just took it up in the shoulder area and now it fits me great (and doesn't reveal nearly as much cleavage). Got great compliments on it!
4.0,Really cute but cheap product
4.0,These items from China r always small so I usually wear a large so I ordered a xlarge.  It fit great . The material is a medium weight . The length comes to my finger tip . Covers my butt well.
4.0,Pretty but I was expecting something a little more substantial for the price. Nice though.
4.0,Wearing it now. Goes with everything due to the color variation.
4.0,I bought the size medium and I’m 5’8 with a 31 in waist or size 10-12. Fits everywhere but not long enough to wear with any sort of wedge or heeled shoe. Have to wear with flats. Still a decent purchase for the price.
4.0,"good fit in seat, waist, length.  would buy again ."
4.0,"I like the look, the size, color and style.  What I don’t like is the extreme stiffness of the purse. It’s so stiff it’s difficult to open the purse to<br />Place wallet and other items inside. I will keep it and hope with time and use it will soften up some.<br />Five stars not possible due to extreme stiffness."
4.0,I love daisy and what a daisy representation is diffently me
4.0,First day and received several compliments... only negative is the structure is very stiff.
4.0,"They’re really soft and stretchy... but they keep sliding down. I’ve been wearing them as I work from home, and no matter how high I pull them up, they’ll ride down when I move. I wore them out in public once and it was really annoying to keep pulling them up. They seem to fit fine everywhere else"
4.0,"these ran a little small so I had to give them to my mom, she likes them though :)"
4.0,Bought as a gift for my 19 year old daughter. She loves them.
4.0,This is a huge scarf!! It is thick and a very nice quality too. I just can't figure out how to use such a huge scarf. Going to have to watch some youtube videos I guess!
4.0,just how it looks.
4.0,"Very soft material, but thin, so I'm glad I ordered the black. I wish it had a built-in shelf bra, that would have made the girls feel more ""secure"" but the bands at the top and bottom are great. I am a 38DD and ordered L but I think I may want to try the M."
4.0,"very nice dress, a little see through , but nice dress"
4.0,My son loved his boots
4.0,"I like this scarf ring though it was a bit heavier and glitzier than anticipated. It does work well and goes with a wide variety of scarves. Importantly, it doesn't have rough edges, so it can be used safely with silk scarves."
4.0,"I ordered the color olive in a size large and it actually fits me great. I am 5'7 and I weigh about one hundred and twenty-five pounds. The real color that the dress looks like to me is a greyish blue which is fine because it is the same color I ordered. But an olive color to me seems like it would be a greenish color so I am confused about that a little bit. When I ordered I was ordering this because I wanted an extra long shirt and that is what I got. I am kinda tall so this is too short for me to ware as a plain dress which I am fine with. I wanted this so I can ware it with leggings or spandex shorts and it looks great with them. I like that I can also ware this with jeans or just about anything and it keeps my booty covered.<br /><br />The material is nice and soft, I like that it is really comfortable. I like that this material is not real heavy, it is a light material that is great for spring or summer. Another part of this that I really like is the scoop neck. That is my favorite style neck line because I am a very plain person. I feel like this is well made in regards to the stitching and the material<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was able to purchase this product sample for a discounted price. In return for the discounted price I was asked to provide my honest and unbiased feedback."
4.0,"Nice quality, and it looks really cute.."
4.0,"Okay I really feel the need to make this this clear to y'all - this idem clearly states women's MINI Dress haha so if y'all want to walk around comfortable without your hooha showing - then I definitely recommend ordering two sizes up - however I ordered my usual size, which is a large and I'm around 160lbs so this women's mini dress fits me comfortably as a long fancy t-shirt which is still adorable! The material is somewhat shear but isn't see through! I did however pay $10.99 for this idem so if it go's back down to its original price - I would definitely buy another one that's two sizes up so the length is comfortable as a mini dress and not be paranoid of my hooho showing haha because it is in fact super cute! I'll update this with pic's later! How this was helpful!"
4.0,"Nice quality, big glasses. They fit on my face without rubbing my cheekbones. I would've liked them not quite so large but I was warned: they are truly oversized."
4.0,"The fleece bathrobe is so soft, very warm when wearing it, size is same as the description and fits well, very worthy"
4.0,"It's cute, was a little big on me for a large so I'm exchanging for a medium to see how it fits. If not,  I'll get alterations."
4.0,I just bought this watch during a sales promotion for quite a bit less than the price listed here.  Very elegant and attractive design.  The band is a little on the light weight side so it does not have that more substantial feel you would expect for a watch in the three to four hundred dollar range but I am happy with the price I paid for it.
4.0,I absolutely LOVE this dress!!! I bought it for a wedding and it fit perfect! I’m 36D and 5’8” and ordered the Large based on the size chart. The pleats in the skirt make for a very flattering fit and helped hide my self conscious areas. The pockets are super cute too! I received several compliments and felt beautiful and cute in this dress. Very happy with this purchase.<br />PS I returned the sleeves version as it fit too large and sleeves were baggy. Sleeves dress also did not have pockets and skirt lacked pleating. Super bummed it did t fit right but very satisfied with the sleeveless versions.
4.0,"Lovely piece of gold jewelry at a reasonable price.  However, the anklet is extremely delicate when compared to the photo."
4.0,"The online description said machine wash and dry but when it arrived the instructions said don't put it in the drier. I don't want socks I can't put in the drier so I tested them on low heat - they shrank some, but since I am short and have small feet, this was not a problem.  If anything, they fit better after going through the drier. If you aren't short, you will have to not put them in the drier."
4.0,Great dress but I'd recommend buying a size larger than you usually wear. The fabric is a little see thru so you will need to wear some kind of slip underneath.
4.0,and cozy!
4.0,Just a 4 star designs good but material is thin.
4.0,I loved this jacket at first; it’s very soft and warm and fits true to size. I ended up with a defect but was contacted by the seller for a refund. Happy with the customer service!
4.0,"Daughter loved these. The backs are clear plastic and my daughter lost them both the 3 day. But the back is easy to replace, we used a broken pencil eraser. She wears them daily and they have really held up!"
4.0,Flattering and super cute with shorts. I’m normally a medium but returned for a small which fits perfect. 36D chest
4.0,I usually wear a small or extra small depending on the material and reading the reviews thought this shirt would run small so I bought a medium and it fit me really big. Also the material is thin. Go with your size. Otherwise I like the shirt just wish it fit.
4.0,"This watch is pretty great. It looks just like it does in the picture, since it doesn't have metal, I'm not breaking out in hives wearing it. The issue I had, was that it was huge on my wrist. It did have the tool to take out the pins, but it busted after trying desperately to get the pins out. They would not budge. I finally got them off, but hopefully I won't get fat, because I had to break the pieces off. Works great now, though!"
4.0,I ordered a half size up based on other reviews so fit is fine by doing that.
4.0,"Seamless transaction, haven’t worn it yet but I think it will do well for Halloween"
4.0,Great beanie but didn’t realize it said Nikegolf on the reverse side ☹️
4.0,Fits well and arrived quickly.
4.0,Really cute and warm but get a size up
4.0,"I ordered this in the solid green color in a medium.  I am 5'8"" and 165lbs with a DD bust. The material was quite a bit stiffer than I thought it would be but it did have a good amount of stretch to be able to move around on a dance floor.  I did have to pull the skirt part down pretty often as it bunched up just by walking or sitting.  I think if the material was smoother / silkier, it would not have had that problem.  A steamer did OK to get the many many wrinkles out of it. The color was very rich and I received a lot of compliments on the dress so it'll look good but may not be the most comfortable or the most easy to manage."
4.0,"Nice shirt, slightly smaller than expected"
4.0,Love the band and great price
4.0,I bought them for use with tabi boots. They fit and feel well...a lot better than the nylon socks (my opinion).
4.0,I like the quality of the shirt.
4.0,"Well first off, I just rated my knew Zeppelin, 7640-4 5 star for the feature ""Stretch"".  Not sure that a Stretch feature is applicable for a watch, but I didn't want to dock the rating.  Anyway....<br />I ordered the Zeppelin 7640-4, White Dial with Big Date, but I received the Zeppelin 7640-2, Black Dial with Big Date.<br />I was disappointed and reached out to the seller, to see if they had sent the wrong item.  They did and kindly suggested that I initiate a return as there was not a Zeppelin 7640-4, White Dial available for exchange.<br />That was my intent, but as I was at work ( from home), i set the watch on my desk and finally succumbed to the lure of a new watch and decided to keep it.<br />The Zeppelin 7640-2 which I now have on my wrist for the last 2 days is comfortable, a nice unique piece.  the band is awesome.  The Black dial face with the Big Date has the iconic zeppelin logo.  The watch hands are pleasing to watch.  Big Date is kind to my baby boomer eyes. I like the separate dual time sub-dial that can be adjusted  with the second crown.  The Tachymeter format of the dial is cool.<br />Overall it is a great watch.<br />The one thing I will say about the 7640-2 Zeppelin, black dial doesn't look as black as some of the black dial watches I've had.  It appears as a dark gray.  Maybe because of the white details through out the watch, optically lighten the overall black.  It looks a better in fluorescent lighting or sunlight.  With normal light like at my house the face of the watch seems a bit obscured.<br />Lastly, I'll say kudos to the Seller, Xquisit Watches.  Although, it seems an error on their side allowed a ship of the wrong watch.  They responded quickly to my concern. My package arrived quickly and earlier than UPS (or amazon) estimated.  That is appreciated despite the mix up.<br />The Black Dial Zeppelin with Big Date (7640-2) is a nice watch.  I would recommend it and am glad I kept it."
4.0,"(Cloak not included) but the fit was PERFECT. Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. Got him the XL he is 6”1’ and 200 pounds. It seemed like it was tailored perfectly for him. He has such a presence in this costume. Great buy. The fabric is ok nothing fantastic but it looks good, I think it’s worth it for the price!"
4.0,"These run super big! Normally bathing suits seem to run small and my husband normally wears a 36 waist so he definitely should’ve gotten the Large, not the XL. The elastic is not a great quality so it doesn’t stretch much and is a bit awkward to use the ties to tighten it to fit better. The ties do go all the way around the waist so it is possible to tighten it to fit. The band just looks a little awkward and bunched. The print is nice and fashionable. The length falls at my husband’s knee. He’s 6’1”, athletic and approx 205 lbs. He likes them, also wishes he would’ve gotten a large but these will work for backyard swimming. He says he prolly wouldn’t wear them out to a pool since they’re so large. Would definitely recommend following size chart. These are decent swim trunks for the price point."
4.0,"Very pretty, and comfortable!"
4.0,"Color does not match military acu's. It's fine for skiing and fishing, but not to accompany acu's."
4.0,"love them and super warm. The ties break easily though, but great and comfy!"
4.0,Absolutely lovely dress hugs the body nice to show of any curves really nice summer fall dress
4.0,Material good and everything but the cut didn't allow it to Fall on you like the pic
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments with this top cuz it's unique. It has no stretch and the white part is mostly opaque. Not high quality, but is high compliments. Only buy if you want the style, not quality."
4.0,Very nice necklace. goes well with deep cut dresses or tops.
4.0,Just as stated. Just a lil smaller than I thought but otherwise great
4.0,I’m size 12-13 depending on the shoe company. They are just a tad small but I can barely notice throughout the day.
4.0,"Good product for the price, included a case, lens cloth,  fabric pouch, lanyard.<br />Polarization works well also."
4.0,I’ve been wanting these for a while and I was so happy when they came! I wasn’t to thrilled when I discovered they had chipped frames.
4.0,"Nice gloves, but they fit a bit big for size.  Not a deal breaker."
4.0,This will do double-duty as protection + Halloween costume.
4.0,"They help with the glare of headlights but are a little big for my face. Good product, good price."
4.0,"A bit flimsy, but for the price, I can't be a super critic. They work well for stylish work sunglasses."
4.0,Good for driving and being able to read without changing glasses
4.0,"I'd still recommend these to anyone, but they're a bit snug...a lil' tight in the waist...LOVE that they have Owsley bears!!"
4.0,"I was looking for a watch that wasn't too overwhelming for my small wrist. This watch is simple and classy. My only wish was for the band to be a tad thicker. Other than that, I think it's a great buy!"
4.0,This Jacket gets that King of Cool look at a great price.  Mine fit perfectly and I wear it every day.  I keep watching the site for other colors.  I'll probably buy at least two more.
4.0,This is so cute! I am using it for my classroom Science Bag.
4.0,"I purchased this hat to keep my head warm while jogging outdoors in the winter. Secret admission, I especially love when the wind blows and the tail part streams along behind me. However, the tassel strings can easily be pulled out (that's why only 4 stars) - so you have to be careful not to get that part caught on anything. Otherwise, this knit cap is soft, will keep your head warm, and is a good fit."
4.0,"These are nice yoga socks. I never bought yoga socks so I didn't know what to expect. Kinda strange having my toes out but it worked just fine. Since they tie like ballet slippers, it's hard to wear with boots. I tried that in the wintertime and was uncomfortable with the bow on the socks Because there wasn't enough room.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well they will be at being non-slip in a yoga setting. I'll let you be the judge of that."
4.0,"Yes, it meets my expectations. Two things: the buttons rattle (very annoying), and there quite a few threads I had to cut off when I ironed it. However, for the price, it is a good deal."
4.0,When I put it on it did not look as I expected but it is very pretty fits very well and well made
4.0,"I opted for the medium-to-wider head size.  The glasses do stay on my face without slipping, but with the comfortable spring-hinged temples, I probably could have gone with the smaller width.  The lenses are truly crystal clear, and the grey frame color softens my appearance (though it would be nice if the frames came in a pale translucent - or clear - peach color, for an even more subtle effect).  The case offers firm protection, but I rarely put them away.  Only one negative: my glasses arrived without the microfiber cleaning cloth pictured in the description. :("
4.0,"Great hat, but not the best when it is windy as the large size aids the wind and away it goes."
4.0,The print on this dress is perfect!! The length is perfect! I’m 5’8 so it’s hard to find dresses long enough. This one is great!! It is a little on the bigger side but it’s super comfy!
4.0,Nice shirt - somewhat thin material with some lose strings which were easily cut.  Seems to run small - would order a larger size than you think.
4.0,Super cute camp tank top
4.0,I really liked the color selection. The fit was good overall but the straps on one or two colors are a tad snug and almost tight although I don’t remember which colors. Good for small to average size heads. Overall good masks and I would re-purchase.
4.0,Don’t judge it’s really great n light I run on a small jacket but it’s a bit baggy but I asked for people’s recommendation n they say they love it and they want me to buy them a pair of these jackets so yea it’s great
4.0,This is really cute and even has Zeppelin art on the inside and none of the designs have rubbed off or faded at all (I've had it about two months) it holds everything I need it to. My only complaint is that when you open the part that holds the coins sometimes the coins fall out.
4.0,"Well made, sized correctly, good price.  What's not to like?"
4.0,A great classic look for my kid. Look much more expensive than they actually are and have held up well so far.
4.0,"while the quality of material could be better, for the price, it is a great deal. I expect to purchase more!"
4.0,Love this! Receive compliments all the time! Finding the metal to tarnish a little bit which is why I can't give it the full 5 stars
4.0,Good buy for cotillion. Hard to get out wrinkles
4.0,This suit fits a tad on the small size so if you are larger chested definitely go up a size. Held up well to a week at the water park and washing. Super comfortable and hides the mom tummy well
4.0,The dagger's were hard plastic and a little dangerous for younger children
4.0,Sent these to my son at camp.  They were a big hit with my son and his cabin mates. Fun!
4.0,These are nice T-shirts for pajamas
4.0,"Originally on the fence about this dress, I decided to take a chance and ordered it. I'm not disappointed. What I like: arrived on time, flattering rose (closer to hot pink) color and the overall fit. What I don't like: horrible packaging, wrinkled dress material, and ill-fitting shoulder area. I wear a size 6 or 8 dress and ordered a medium, which fits well. The material stretches, but if you have a &#34;pooch&#34; or  -consider spanx. Good value for the price."
4.0,Very nice lightweight material but the fit is small.
4.0,"very good material for its price. Love the ponytail opening, allows me to have my high ponytails :)"
4.0,I ordered this as a cheaper extra gift to give to my sister-in-law's baby for a present. It was cute enough. It looks a little on the dinky side but thats ok. Its probably an ok value for the money and it fit her well enough.
4.0,The band runs a little big which was fine for me.  I really like it good buy colors are very nice ( pale ).<br />Would buy it again if needed!!
4.0,I have a small face so these are a little big for me.  I also wish the lenses were a little darker.
4.0,I use this so I don't need to carry a purse when I'm out with my 4 y.o. It's not as bulky as a typical fanny pack. The only thing I didn't not care for is the fabric. It is very rough to the touch.
4.0,"Hernan survivors are great boots. These are heavy and they don't breathe very well but you can rely on them and trust them. If you use them everyday you might want to get something to dry them at the end of the day. It kills me to see them on Amazon for $199 when MSRP is right on the tag and only available at Walmart for $89. Whoever is clearing out the Walmart shelves and trying to overcharge people on Amazon, shame on you..."
4.0,I loved this in the fall.
4.0,Very pretty pendant - my only issue was that I find the chain too short.
4.0,"Here's the thing, I absolutely LOVE this necklace--I wore it yesterday and it was beautiful and my friend made a comment about how pretty it is. Plus, it has an actual locket so I'm going to get a small picture for it. The only criticisms I have are that the clasp that hooks is a weaker metal, and I can already see it pulling open which will break it. I think I have a pair of pliers around here some where and I'm going to squeeze that ring/circle closed so it's not pulling open. The other thing is that the necklace is a MESS to deal with--I almost think it should have been designed so all the necklaces hook off of one main chain, rather than having a bunch of necklaces lumped together to clasp. Trying to organize and unravel this to put it on takes time, all the chains get tangled and folded over each other and it's a huge mess.  If you have the patience to work it out and organize it so you can put it on--the necklace itself is stunning. Each charm is beautiful and well made. It's a nice thick metal and most of the chain is thick and durable--only the ones that attach to the clasp are questionable as I mentioned earlier.<br />This is a gorgeous necklace. Keep it hung up so it stays untangled and you will have a beautiful necklace that will get tons of compliments.Disclaimer: I have received a discounted rate in exchange for providing my honest review but my opinion is solely my own.

4.0,"Sizing ok. Bad quality but I get it, for the price especially.<br />Cool pattern."
4.0,Goes well with my Hannibal Lector / leather face mask
4.0,Decent pairs of slipper socks!
4.0,"i thought getting earrings that allowed the back (and in the case of these earrings the front, too. both ends screw on and off) to screw on and off would be a good idea, so what i got was exactly what i ordered, i can't fault the seller for that. but when theyre that small i cant get my fingers around them. need to be cleaned daily even though my earlobes arent having allergic reactions to them, and daily cleaning when you have to scuffle with smth thats hard to screw in and out is a pain in the ass. i also lost one of the backings like a week after i got them and i cant use other earring backings as a replacement because the posts are so short. never getting an earring with a diameter less than 8mm ever again. again, not the seller's fault, these just did not work for me at all."
4.0,"This dress is lovely but I should have ordered one size up as my regular size was a bit tight.  Otherwise, I intend to order a couple more colors."
4.0,"Great quality, great color. Just make sure you order one size up, it's a bit on the smaller side"
4.0,the purse appears to be well made and the leather is not flimsy but it just don't have the look of a nice purse in my opinion. I am going to keep because it is well made and the hand strap fits over my shoulder which is a big plus because I do not like the long shoulder straps.
4.0,"Comfortable, but a bit too wide in the waist for me."
4.0,Had to return since it ran so small but the feel and look of the fur was fabulous.  So if you can order 2 whole sizes up then this is a really great find.
4.0,"I am 5'7"" and 240lbs. This tracksuit was a loose fitting in on my waist. I had to keep pulling up but the top fit fine because im top heavy. I wore this for throwback thursday at work. Everyone said we looked awesome!!! My coworker also got her outfit from amazon!!

4.0,Hardly notice its on my wrist😊 I'm very satisfied.
4.0,Love it. Ended up buying a second. Super comfy
4.0,This a nice pair of very simple classic princess cut cubic zirconia stud earrings. These are made from stainless steel which is ok but I found the metal a little dark in tone. The metal is not as light and bright as in the photos on Amazon. The stainless steel lends a darker tone in my opinion to the overall appearance of the stud earrings. I wanted light bright colored metal like in the photos but these are still nice earrings. The earrings have a nice long stem which I really like. I tend to loose backings and but these backings are pretty secure. The stones are nice and bright and clear. I've been wearing the earrings for a few days now and I have not lost one yet nor have I had any reactions to the metal. These are nice classic simple earrings that will match almost every outfit.<br /><br />About This Product:<br /><br />• Princess Cut Cubic Zirconia<br /><br />• Push Backs<br /><br />• Stainless Steel<br /><br />• Does not Rust or Fade<br /><br />• Appropriate for all ages<br /><br />• Length: 3 mm<br /><br />I purchased this product with a promotional discount for my honest review. All of my reviews are my honest opinion regardless of whether I received a discount or not. I am ever paid for my reviews nor do I have an affiliation with the seller.
4.0,"I love how it fits and quality of material is good, my only complain is that it attracts a lot of lint."
4.0,a little difficult for my 4yr old to open
4.0,you can feel it’s cheap but it looks nice very light
4.0,"The material is 100% polyester so not as soft as cotton but for the price, it cannot be beat. the print is cute, exactly as pictured. I am 5'3&#34;, 115 lbs, and small fit perfectly. cute enough for a date, covered enough to wear to work for casual Fridays. On a bright sunny day, this dress could potentially be see through but I think the color would save it. I took one star off because the polyester is quite rough on the skin if you are not expecting it."
4.0,"Love this dress! I ordered the navy color and the fit is super flattering, loving the criss cross addition on the back. I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly, extremely billowy. This dress is not in the slightest form fitting. I'm barely 5'2&#34; and this dress hits just above my knees at its longest length. Knocked a star off for shipping because they delayed my order for some unknown reason. Had somewhat of a pumpkin smell to it? Not concerned, will come out with the first wash. I would totally recommend this dress, especially for the price!"
4.0,"I love the material and the style. However, it does run a little bit small. I am 5’3” and weigh 115#. The dress does stretch but was a little bit snug. It is definitely NOT a midi as advertised. It fit just barely below my knee & I am short legged. I wish it would be about 2 inches longer. Still I love the dress. It is well made and pretty. I am going to return it and order the same thing in a large!"
4.0,They're cute for the price (: I would buy again
4.0,"I was looking for a lightweight, summer robe for when traveling. This is a lovely, soft material and the lace is nice and substantial. I expect it will hold up well. I’m 5’4” and a size 10/12 and there was plenty of room in the One Size version. The bottom of the lace covered my knees, so it isn’t skimpy. I like that there is an interior tie to keep it closed. I guess it might seem a bit sheer in white, but in this shade of green I had full coverage. I’m glad I ordered this!"
4.0,"For the price, these are an excellent value. However, construction could be improved to eliminate the puckering around neck/arm holes. I have a trim athletic body, I like to show my muscles.  I'm 5' 8"" 170 lbs, and the medium is too large (unless you really want something loose fitting that drops to a little below the butt).  The colors and fabric are great.  Shipping was quick. Thx."
4.0,This dress fit great but the skirt was VERY stiff and wider/bulkier than I like. I will be returning it because it’s not the style I was looking for. But it is a cute dress and fit great!
4.0,"I didn't listen to my fellow reviewers and got the medium size. They're really big, but I'll make them work. They also came with a scratch, but that's what you get for 8-10 dollars."
4.0,The dress fit as expected. I’m 5”4 185 pounds the dress came to knee length. I expected the dress to be a little longer but overall it great material and great quality
4.0,I returned as I purchased them for a child And they would be large on an adult. Look really beautiful though.
4.0,Bought to display my Grandfather's railroad watch. Perfect for the purpose
4.0,Quality not as nice as I expected it really looks like they were put together fast & I don't like the way the heel looks.
4.0,These were a great fit on my daughter. She loved them.
4.0,Really nice and a lot come in the pack.  BUT they do not come with hoops to connect to the jewelry. So buy them separately.
4.0,As advertised. Good for 55 degree weather.
4.0,Order a size smaller then you think if you want it fitted! Mine is a little big in the waist and I ordered a large due to the size chart! Should have ordered smaller! I am 5'10 145 with 36DDD..
4.0,"This dress is cute but not as pictured. The fit is somewhat smaller than your regular size so I do encourage you to size up. The dress has a wonderful quality, you can tell that the material is not cheaply made. The only dislike I have about the dress is that its advertised as a midi dress; however the dress is very much in between a mini and a midi (in my opinion). I've worn this dress twice since my purchase and have received many compliments."
4.0,"These really are perfect for tweens/teens. My 12 year old LOVED these and they fit perfectly with no discomfort. So far they have maintained their elasticity and trust me she wears one every day. They are decent quality for the price and worth the small price tag to put a smile on your kid's face. It was one of the most inexpensive gifts I got her for Christmas and one that she was most happy to receive. If you're thinking about it, think no further. Just do it."
4.0,"It's a nice little pendant.  It is very small, a lot smaller than I expected.  The chain is not the best quality, but the pendant is what's important.  The glowing blue heart is the coolest part.  Keep in mind it is a blue glow in the dark material, it will not glow if it doesn't get charged by light.  Overall, it's a neat little pendant that most Zelda fans will like.  Even if your not a fan of Zelda, the glowing heart is still cool."
4.0,"Love love love, great heavy fabric and super versatile. Buying more in other colors."
4.0,Nice dress but its not flattering for someone insecure about their stomach. I ordered a size up and it fit perfectly but I returned the dress since it lacked the belly coverage.
4.0,Jack Skellington is my favorite disney character. this is a cool watch and gave a little disney &#34;edge&#34; to whatever outfit i was wearing.
4.0,Solid compression shirt at a decent price point. I primarily use compression shirts to avoid nipple bleeding during half marathons and marathons- this held up well. I will say after a few times in the wash the neck started to become a bit shriveled. All in all though I was very satisfied and would consider purchasing some of their other products when I am in the market for them.
4.0,"Good quality hoody, reasonable price."
4.0,"The 'flower' has a pretty little beaded feature that I wasn't expecting. However, one of them was damaged, so I trimmed it down. Still a welcome surprise."
4.0,"Fit me very well, i love the elasticity,great, great, great"
4.0,Another good surprise. Never purchased Tom's before but I really like the print so I had to get them. They are very comfortable if you will be walking around for a while.
4.0,"Well, overall it's a really great bikini. Being neoprene, it doesn't feel like the typical bikini. It's more sturdy, as far the bottoms go. The top however, could be improved by a bit of a thicker band around the ribs. That is, unless you have no side or back fat at all.<br /><br />The mismatch of this set is interesting. Looks less modern, more I couldn't find the other half of my bikini, so let's throw on the half from another set.<br /><br />This product was given to me at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"I purchased this suit coat as part of my female Mad Hatter costume for GenCon.  The quality of the coat is much higher than I expected for a suit coat listed as a costume, let alone the price!  The black lace trim is not the cheap, thin lace found on most costumes.  You can actually gently stretch the lace and it doesn't lose it's shape or tear.  The stitching throughout the costume is tight and doubled where it needs to be.  There was only one place where the stitching had started to come lose.  It was nothing to fix.  So far, I think this is going to fit in great with the costume I am putting together!"
4.0,Perfect for work. My head is small so it fits a little big . I just tie the strings a little tighter
4.0,"These are super cute, but turn colour pretty fast. That being said, there are so many of them it almost doesn't matter?"
4.0,Ok my fren love it
4.0,"Beautiful dress, way longer than expected.  I'm 5'4 and it it mid-calf if not lower.  I'f I had time to alter for the wedding I was going to I would have kept it."
4.0,Nice and warm but a bit small fitting.
4.0,Nicer thick material.
4.0,De ancho la veo bien buena calidad pero el largo esta un poco grande para una persona de 5”6 y 180 a 190 lb
4.0,"This hat is a nice color and looks like the picture but I wish it was larger and that the fold of the beanie wasn't stitched in. I also don't want to just tear it out. Other than that, this is a great hat for the money and I have received countless compliments on it. I would recommend this as an addition to the arsenal."
4.0,"The cap is extra large, so I turned it inside out and gathered some of the material with an elastic band to reduce the size.  Otherwise, it fits nicely and stays on through the night.  Additionally., it doesn’t leave any elastic marks in the forehead."
4.0,"It's  huge ! It's a lot larger then I thought it would be, but so pretty."
4.0,"I love leggings! I love leggings in the sun, I love leggings in the snow, I love leggings don't you know?<br />Ha ha, leggings are my go to choice for outfits so I'm definitely a picky shopper. They arrived on time and were packaged nicely, the material is sturdy-though I don't think any fabric will prevent the wearing and bunching between the thighs.<br />My only dislike for these is that the top waist band part isn't sewn very well, so the stitching comes undone slowly which causes the waist to loose it's elasticity to stay up over the hips. I will probably add in some better stitching, but overall really do like the pants!"
4.0,"I didn't realize from the picture, that this was a long sleeved shirt.  I hope it will still fit my grandson by the time is is cold enough for him to wear it. He liked it, so I hope it will work for him."
4.0,"The quality of the socks is nice, very smooth feeling, for me they felt a little too smooth, also the top of the socks barely reached my ankle bone, I was looking for socks that were not calf length, but under the calf, those are minor things, perhaps I’m too pickey, good product though!"
4.0,"It is great. It is a little shorter than I anticipated, and the clips are pretty small. If your mask has a bigger band, it might not work."
4.0,I was happy with the purchase. Great buy for the price. I'm only taking away one star because it's not true to color. The one I received was more of a bright red rather than the dark wine color pictured
4.0,"The charms are very nice and because many are paired it makes them very versatile.  You can make earrings or wrist charms or necklaces.  I have made necklace and wrist charms and even with only one good eye, things went fairly smoothly.<br />I like the charms and if I continue, I will order more."
4.0,"Very long shirt, good fit everywhere else."
4.0,Very nice! Gave it as a gift and the person loves it.
4.0,"Very cute, I love the cotton material. It's not that weird polyester stuff so many dresses are made of now. I am a 14 in dress size and the XL is too big."
4.0,"The bracelet looks good, the package is very nice. Great small gift for someone younger. Clasp is a little difficult for someone to work alone."
4.0,These tights are wonderful and the foot straps are the best. I have a long inseem and they fit great without having to stretch. Love them!
4.0,"Wonderful, versatile skirt. Can be dressed up or down. Fabric is super soft, but a little thin. My only minor quibble is that the waistband is a little finicky - the elastic is not as wide as the panel it sits in, so it has to be adjusted/settled into place."
4.0,"I love it, but it's a little to big. I order the wrong size, so I fixed. Easier than returning."
4.0,Present for a friend who loved it.
4.0,good hat and price
4.0,Brought them for my guy who is a big man and rides his motorcycle. He loves them! Good dit and comfortable to wear.
4.0,Little short and the sleeves maybe not the comfiest but it worked for the Photoshoot we were doing!
4.0,I wanted something light weight to pack. and this was it. cheap and small. its semi hard so dont think they would keep your glasses from getting crushed. it wont.
4.0,"Love these glasses, but they scratch so easy. I didn't get much wear out of them before thy name significantly scratched up. I do like the graduated darkness of the lens. The top is darker, and it gradually gets lighter toward he bottom.<br />Thy are very vintage looking and wide enough to give full coverage, which is nice sine I have light sensitivity.<br />I would like to get a second pair, but worry they too will get messed up. So just be careful with them if you get them!!"
4.0,"There’s no coating or anything in the rubber strap so fuzz and dirt and really anything lives to stick to the band. I have other rubber straps from cheap to expensive and this is by far the worst rubber strap I have worn or seen. I have 25$ watches with much better rubber. However, that’s the only fault I can find besides the buttons not actually activating the mechanisms. Go for something cheaper and you will actually get more for the money."
4.0,For watch could be more rounded
4.0,"This pajama set is exactly as pictured! Very pretty and comfortable. Straps are a stretchy material. The top and bottoms do tend to cling and the top rides up on the bottom, but overall a true to size set. If you have sensitive skin the floral details can be scratchy."
4.0,A good buy ! Definitely won’t see many walking around with the same jersey on
4.0,Will get more i oder a large
4.0,Leisure wear light jacket.
4.0,"Also a Christmas present, he loves them. He cant wear them too much since they arent very dark. thats why i only gave it 4/5"
4.0,This a supercute jumbo squishie!i love it !!!
4.0,Buen producto le quedaron excelente al chamo
4.0,"Very happy with the jacket the houndstooth trim is a most have. It was a bit to big but when you roll the selves up it fit fine,"
4.0,My nieces thought these were fun. We have hard wood floors in the house and the grips are nice. They fit according to size.
4.0,I didn't like the sleeves. Sleeves we're a little tight Suppose to be an XL but the sleeves doesn't feel like it.
4.0,"Feels great, but the hard plastic soles are really loud on hardwood floors."
4.0,I can't get this toe ring to fit correctly like on the picture...it moves around way too easily.  I've had other toe rings before and you generally just mold it to your toe but this one does not stay in place.
4.0,I'm good with belt
4.0,"This is a great watch and I love the look of it. My only reason for the 4-star rating is due to the band- it has these stabilizers at the base of the watch that are meant to keep the rather large watch piece from rolling on your wrist. The material of the band and stabilizers is uncomfortable against the skin and actually pulls the hair on my arms (I ended up removing the pins and shaving down and removing the stabilizers).<br /><br />This was my experience of course, so may not be the same for the next buyer. But, I would like it if Casio offered other band options for this or other makes-I have not found any so far."
4.0,Will work well when I am dressed
4.0,Definitely waterproof. The only complaint is that the mesh water bottle pockets are not deep enough and bottles will fall out.
4.0,"Although I am a small I originally ordered a medium because of comments.  The medium was absolutely too big, returned  and exchanged for a small, fit perfectly.  Have worn several times and gotten numerous compliments  Looks nice."
4.0,It go with everything
4.0,These comfy socks are not visible when worn in your shoes.
4.0,Just as was described. Very pleased
4.0,"This bag is really beautiful. When I first opened it, it had a terrible glue smell and the side with the design had sticky glue on it. I fixed these problems by removing the excess glue with a cloth, and airing out the bag for a few days to get rid of the smell. Looking forward to using this bag at an upcoming wedding."
4.0,Cute but buy up a size or two!
4.0,"It's very cute, but it looks like the gem may fall off and it may be a little heavy.  Overall, it's super cute though."
4.0,I liked waffle pattern & lighter choice of some colors. Side slits
4.0,These are a great buy! However i was upset i couldnt wear them because i ordered the wrong size.
4.0,light weight，comfortable
4.0,"Love the versitality with this comfy dress. It’s somwhat thin, so summer and spring are the best places for it. This red one came wit a tube top, but the navy one did not. Not sure why."
4.0,This is a nice dress love the material
4.0,"I didn't expect it to fit my Orient Ray but somehow it did without any filing or manipulation. Only gripe is that the quality is a little subpar, with the steel getting scratched very easily. You get what you pay for though. Looks great regardless."
4.0,Got for 15 dollars and you can't really beat that. It was a steal the watch is very good quality for the price.
4.0,"I wish there wasn’t a separation in it. Or the 2 parts were a little bigger. Besides that, i love it. I got the other colors too like 4-5 of these"
4.0,It fits but wow it really does get everything holding in but I like
4.0,They are too big for my 6y/o daughter. They Have super cute designs but just too big.
4.0,Very cute and nicer than I expected.  Good job!
4.0,Fast shipping and came as advertised. My husband loves it!
4.0,Gave them to my aunt as a Christmas gift. She is happy with them. She loves flowers and used to work in landscape design so it was a perfect gift. Kind of wishing I had looked into silver instead of gold as an option but still they look nice!
4.0,"Is a good wallet, but credit cards stick a bit tight in the slots."
4.0,I ordered a size up because I wanted extra room for thick socks.  They are little tighter than expected. The plastic plaid is noisy when you walk.  Otherwise very warm!
4.0,I was a bit hesitant when i bought this cause i was worried that the material will be really hard and will ended up getting blister but i love design so much so i tried and buy it and i’m glad i did. The shoes is so soft and comfy and beautiful. My 4 year old loves it and keeps wearing them even inside the house.
4.0,"Very nice detail and good feel.  For the length, I like a little loser fit."
4.0,"This is a cute round bag and was a birthday gift to myself. I have several ""Love Moschino & Moschino"" bags. This is a nice addition to my collection. It will not hold much (small cell phone, keys, lipstick) but, perfect to walk around the Mall. Just know you are ordering this from Italy. My bag was damaged but luckily, the seller made good on my order and I would recommend them. The communication was great as well. They quickly responded to my emails."
4.0,"They look nice and are slimming. Tummy control is good but I got the wrong size so make sure you get pants true to your size, the tummy control part will be too tight if you size down"
4.0,I have not worn them yet but they fit well although I only walked down my hall in them.  I'm Praying for great arch Support!!
4.0,I wanted to wear it to church with the sleeves not off the shoulder and it is tight in the arm pits !
4.0,"Super cute and warm, but stuff definitely likes to stick to it."
4.0,After months of shopping around for a Rolex I finally found it. As I was checking out my phone died. When I finally got it re-started I lost interest so I ordered UberEats and watched a movie. Guess it wasn’t meant to happened. Adios
4.0,"This is a nice t-shirt, with good fabric that isn't sheer. It has subtle, small ribbing that give added interest as well as the buttons on the scoop neck. The L is more like a slightly loose M. It goes below the hips, as shown in the photo and doesn't just hang straight like many tees; there's some slight shaping at the waist. It's flattering. A nice shirt."
4.0,Love it but was not long on my child length was to short
4.0,Grandughter loves them
4.0,"I was worried that the sizing would be off, but it fits perfectly and the length is perfect as well! It is made of thin material, nothing that a thin slip wouldn’t fix.  For the price, I’m super satisfied!"
4.0,My dad is 6’10” 195lb  pant size 33 & he had to really pull the pants low because they were way to short. The sleeves were also short but we did our best. Everything fit well other than that& looked nice. He got really warm wearing it even though it was thin material.
4.0,"Nice fabric to workout in. Runs a little little on the larger side, not super fitted. Good workout tanks!"
4.0,"Purchased as a gift, but ordered the wrong size.  Recipient wears these pants regularly and likes them."
4.0,"Definitely going to order more, these are some of the most comfortable briefs I've ever worn."
4.0,The sound quality was a bit less than expected but still good
4.0,This is a well made necklace and bracelet set! It is stamped 925 silver - so! We shall see how it holds up! I hope 🤞🏼 bc I happen to really like this set!!
4.0,cute summer dress. Light and airy. good quality. Would order again.
4.0,"Good fit on my 5 year old, material seems like nice thickness. I have not washed yet. I thought that I was ordering the flutter sleeve but I got the puffy sleeve."
4.0,"It’s really big on my head. I look like a biker! 😂 I’ll probably get use to it lol But I use it while working out, and it’s great! Doesn’t slide or slip off."
4.0,Good color. Nice material. But it fits little loose for me. I am a petite woman and size small.
4.0,It fits somewhat large in the upper portion but I really like the style and pattern. Arrived sooner than expected!
4.0,"but it looks longer on the picture. I do have long arms, but I thought they were longer. but they are really nice."
4.0,"Lots of choices and a great value for the price.  Straps are a little cheap, wish they were more like ribbons."
4.0,The sizing is a little weird so mine is a little loose. No big issue; but I've had it for maybe 2 months and it's already ripping. Not the best design
4.0,Quit nice.
4.0,"The band arrived 20 days earlier than promised.  Workmanship is very good, the crocodile skin is imprinted but looks rich and authentic.<br />The only issue is the band is too short, and may not serve it’s intended purpose!"
4.0,"Not flimsy, but also not too thin. Very soft material. My main issue is with the slits: they show my bra strap!"
4.0,"I wanted lightweight shorts to wear during the summer. These have the perfect look. But they do run small, so I had to exchange for the next size up, and they also shrink both in length and in the waist in the wash."
4.0,"Great watch, love the face and band.  Settingsand button pushing can be tiresome, but once set, no issue"
4.0,cleans very well. Highly recommended.
4.0,In love with this necklace! Look just like the picture. I have received so many compliments. The Only problem one of the stones came out that's why I didn't give it a five star but can be fixed with glue.
4.0,Very fashionable but man kill the plastic smell... it’s ruining my vibe
4.0,Adorable. Sweatshirt is more of a cropped sweatshirt and falls right at the belt line. Color is more of a yellow beige but overall nice.
4.0,Soften it up<br />Looks good
4.0,"It fit weird I had to take it in up top... But it made a big splash at the part, don't be a sweater though, I had wet spots under my breasts, showed through like a wet suit, whoever called it a scuba suit was correct"
4.0,"More green than blue, but otherwise it matches quite a few of my outfits.  Some how though I ended up with 3 of these. I am not sure how that happened, but I have 2 other orders of this same scarf."
4.0,Love this dress and will be wearing it.  I only wish it was in a different color!!
4.0,The shoulders are a bit small so it doesn't go off the shoulders well and the rest is a bit baggy. It is a nice shirt though and is very comfortable and I am pleased with it.
4.0,Fits as expected and has a longevity far superior than any other non slip shoe on the market
4.0,"Runs small and wouldn't be comfortable if your head is on the large scale (Medium is even pushing it). Folks beside you will hear depending how loud you go and it's not very loud. That brown/tan leather patch you see in the pics is a bit bulky (operation panel). Light blinks blue when on. Light blinks red when needing to be charged.<br /><br />1 day of using while working- Exceeded my expectation! My fully charged phone ended up dying before this hat. Just wanted some music without looking obvious. Someone pointed out a ""Cool blue light"" on the the hat but they had no idea why... so if you are trying to go under the radar figure it out. Got the job done for me without much distraction so 4 stars on the first day."
4.0,"purchased for a gift, little disappointed but had to give anyway didn't have time to make another choice, necklace was strung on thick thread, which was ok, there was one section about 2-3 inches with nothing on it, like beads and this was in the middle, so it was so noticeable....i really should order another to see if this was the design of the piece.........,"
4.0,"Durability over time remains to be determined, so can’t yet give a fifth star. But the watchband installs easily and the Velcro closure is a distinct improvement on the Apple squeeze-the-metal-studs-into-holes original equipment band."
4.0,Good for baby turtle
4.0,Fun casual dress with pockets
4.0,I used it for prom it was really small but it was a big hit and went with my dress perfect
4.0,"So everyone says that a wide waist band won’t roll down.  I can say they did not roll down but they creeped down eventually.  I am very short waisted so they makes it a bit harder.  Also, these are really soft and I love the feel."
4.0,Love the color. It looks like leather but it's actually canvas. I wish there are more pockets inside that would protect gadgets like my phone or pocket wifi.
4.0,"Thanks to reviews, I ordered 1 size up, so it's better. I wear clothes of XS-S, height is 5.4. And I ordered M, and it fits okay, but maybe I had to order even L, so it wouldn't go up when walking and was a bit looser in waist."
4.0,"Super cute, comfy and true to size! FYI, as the picture shows, a lot of your booty will show. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't give you the best boob support due to the low cut U shaped fit."
4.0,"Good Quality, but pretty small."
4.0,Love this dress very comfortable love the packets
4.0,Material real thin not true to size
4.0,Nice purchase and the necklace looks awesome. Great buy
4.0,Very see though so be careful to wear dark underwear with these pants
4.0,I ordered my size and they were to small so I returned them so hopefully the next size up fits because I really like the style
4.0,I ordered one size bigger (12) and it fits great on length and waist on my daughter who is 9yo. Material seems good.
4.0,Quality as advertised
4.0,I like it but the clamp and chain is too weak for the bulk of the necklace but it does make a &#34;statement&#34;
4.0,"Just as expected..small, cute and fashionable"
4.0,Hot form fitting dress!! Hugs my curves and makes and incredible statement!! Total bad ass!!!
4.0,It was a nice fit for a family picture.
4.0,This was a super cute cover up. Only reason I gave 4 stars was because it’s hot. It’s not breathable beach fabric it’s more like polyester and was a bit heavy and swampy. Cute to wear to the beach then take off and get in the ocean. When trying to just hang out and lounge beachside in it I was hot and sweaty.
4.0,Jut what we needed for the wedding reception
4.0,Just got it today. Colors are a little darker than the pictures but it's still beautiful. Feathers were a bit messed up from the chains as well as switched. (Striped - full color and full color - striped)
4.0,"I ordered the item thinking that it was a patch, not a large metal badge, thinking the description was a typo.  It is a nice item to use for a display, like a collector's plate, or you can wear it like a badge.  Pretty good idea, I'd say."
4.0,Lovely cuff! It has a bit more shine than I expected but overall is very nice.
4.0,My daughter loves this dress! We needed a dress for a party and didn't want to spend a lot. The sequins and tulle overlay on the skirt are so pretty. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the material is thin and delicate.
4.0,"These are very comfortable leggings.  I am 5'2, 146 lbs, ordered these in the medium and they come down to mid-calf on me.  When you wear them after washing them, they are a little tighter around the crotch area at first but do loosen up throughout the day.  The material is good quality - isn't too thick for summer, but isn't see-through either.  Perfect year-round.  The waistband does flip underneath my belly (despite constant readjustments) and when it does so, it applies pressure to my c-section scar, but that's on me and not the garments themselves - just letting those who have a pot belly like I do that this may happen to you, too.  I would still recommend these leggings."
4.0,Nice swimsuit. Runs small so go up a size. I'm 5'2 size 12. I bought a 2xl. Looks like picture.
4.0,Nice product  sizes run small. Medium is like A small
4.0,Great size for cartilage
4.0,Whenever I wear these my boyfriend calls me the Geometry’s wizard. They’re a little loose but overall great especially considering the price
4.0,It’s pretty but I do not like the flap in the back
4.0,"Fits well, and I'm not a small guy.  The wine color  is great. I just might buy another one..."
4.0,Very cute! Very fast shipping !Ordered as a gift for my sister in law and she loved the assortment ! The only reason I took off a star is because one of the charms broke on one of them after she wore it for a day but luckily she has 11 others to choose from. For the price I would still purchase for myself after seeing them on her !
4.0,It's big so order like a size smaller maybe 2.
4.0,I love the colors& design. It's too long. Trying to order the right size is tricky. I'm just hoping it holds up😊
4.0,"This tank is very cute. It is very lightweight, but comfortable material, and great for warmer months. I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs; I ordered a small and it fits loosely which I like. The two slits on the sides expose a little of whatever is worn underneath. I will likely purchase other colors."
4.0,i like it but its a little tight
4.0,Cute top. Fits well
4.0,pretty but lightweight
4.0,"Fits perfectly, I feel a little like cat woman!  I bought this for a casual evening on a cruise ship and I think it will be perfect since it is dress/casual.  I haven't washed it yet so I hope it washes well."
4.0,Very pleased with these suits.  Great delivery and fit!
4.0,"For what it is.... this isn't a bad apron for light duty tasks. Keep in mind this a thin and breathable apron and isn't meant for heavy duty metal grinding and that type of tough use. I bought this for use with my Dremel tool. It would also be good for gardening, I would imagine. 🙂"
4.0,"This pull over/cardigan is nice and soft. It is a perfect length for me, I'm 5'4 and 160 lb, I got a large. The print is beautiful and it is well sewn. I love that it looks great wearing it open but also has the option of buttoning it up. I would prefer less buttons as it has 7 and possibly a different type of button. It's very nice for fall here in NC as it's not too hot of a material. Product is as described and pictured and I will definitely be purchasing more."
4.0,"I got these shoes for playing intramural flag football.  They fit pretty snug compared to the casual Nike shoes I own in the same size.  When I tied them tight though it felt like they slid around on my foot a bit when I made hard cuts.  The shoes still worked well for what I purchased them for, they were a huge improvement over tennis shoes.  If you are getting them for soccer though it is worth noting that the toe of the shoe is pretty soft, only the heel and bottom of the shoe are rigid."
4.0,"Wore it for about four months straight give or take. The leather began to look aged, which was a good thing because it added character, but the strings that held the bottom together broke after about 4 months. The breaking my have been to my fault though, as I tied the strings once they were to the size i wanted and I have to pick at the knot to get it untied to take off."
4.0,This is my second case from poetic and I am satisfied with the fit and quality.<br />The item arrived on time and in great condition.  The only problem is when trying to prop the case to make it a stand for the tablet.
4.0,For the money this one fits and is of average quality for these kinds of costumes. Its average size and has a battery pack for the fan to inflate  The fan is quiet and inflates quickly. Happy with this item.
4.0,"strap is comfortable enough, very light weight. The light is basically useless unless you just want to know the hour. I had this watch as a child, before the &#34;indiglow&#34; wave of advancements hit watches, but I recently purchased one for my runs. Simple to configure and use, and cheap so the purpose was served!"
4.0,"Stylish clip. I bought it to cinch the waist of my loose dresses and can also use to clip the top of sweaters that I don't want to button. So far, it stays securely clipped."
4.0,Only thing I disliked was ther gold zippers on the bag.  Would have liked it better if it was silver. But the bag itself was very nice.
4.0,"Cute prints, soft, but the run small and shrink with each wash"
4.0,Love the purse. I have gotten numerous compliments on it. The only bd thing is that it has a strange offensive odor. I have to keep the inside sprayed with perfume.
4.0,"Plenty room for the boobs, but the bottom elastic is pretty tight for an XL."
4.0,Nice and cool. Very comfortable....
4.0,"I regularly wear a size 6.5, which is the size I ordered. However, if you want to wear thicker socks then I would suggest going up a half size. They run just a tad small. Also, they look a little cheap. The bright brass and zipper really stand out, I wear them under my work pants. They came with a little bit of glue on them, and a little dusty. For thirty bucks tho, they do the job. I would recommend, so far at least!"
4.0,"Like the other one I purchased, this gown is really pretty as far as design and trim, but it is not really that comfortable because the material it is made of is not that soft.  Even after being washed several times and rinsed in Downy it is still a fairly stiff fabric with no signs of softening.  Other than that, it is well made and as I said, very pretty."
4.0,"The material seems to be very good quality, the hood kinda oversize unless you wearing a baseball cap. the sleeves probably little short for some. the front pouch pocket kinda weird, zippers there, but no zipper puller. have not been out in the rain yet, can't say the jacket is waterproof, but seems like it should be. I'm wearing US size large, I ordered size XL and it fit just right if you want xtra room you might have to order 2 size up. other than that I'm happy with it."
4.0,"Extremely cute and stylish. The shirt might be a bit uncomfortable though,just not the soft material I’m used to see on kids clothes. But good to wear somewhere for a bit,and for pics."
4.0,Came fast! & are excellent in colors! So bright(:
4.0,"This necklace is much prettier in person than photos,<br />Doesn’t look cheap"
4.0,"Cute, material is kinda strange though."
4.0,Over all it is what I expected for this onesie it’s very comfortable but it can get very hot In it
4.0,Really like the fit and style!
4.0,EN TIEMPO Y CALIDAD ESPERADA
4.0,Very cute suit for the price! It did get pebbly easily though after only a few wears. The material also started to become thin and see through after about 5-10 uses. The style is very cute and flattering to curvy figures.
4.0,good  and cheap price.
4.0,"Great Granddaughter loved it.  Wish it were easier to make smaller.  When I tell her I love her to the moon and back, her answer is &#34;I love you to mars and back&#34;, so this was a great gift for her."
4.0,Adorable! Great fit amazing price!
4.0,They are beautiful but scratchy material
4.0,Fits a little small but very lite and comfortable.
4.0,"This is a very nice swim suit. It's super comfortable. Just as pictured. Love the design of teller bust area, helps keep in the girls a little better and more coverage. I will definitely recommend this to anyone. Perfect for all shapes and sizes. So pleased"
4.0,"fits comfortably except upper arm a little snug  love the material feel, color and look"
4.0,"I have rather tiny little lady wrists, and this was a bit big, even when I tightened it too. I still like it and wear it around."
4.0,My wife loves the material and fit.
4.0,"Second best belt I've had in my lifetime. Soft, full leather, built to last casual belt. Hope it lasts the 12 years my favorite belt did."
4.0,"My only complaint would be the actual Lapel is huge...didn't think it would be that big...so when you put the collar up, it goes half way up my head. Color was perfect and it fits great! Thanks again!"
4.0,"These shoes are SUPER cute and look great with a pair of jeans, but… they are very flat with no padding/cushion whatsoever so they’re not really comfortable to wear. I will wear these on days when there will be minimal walking."
4.0,I love these shoes! Super comfortable and fits true to size.  Gave a 4 start review rating because one of the sandals had scuff mark not noticeable
4.0,"so pretty, quick shipping!"
4.0,Look nice. Arms seem a bit thin. Going to hope they are sturdier than they look.
4.0,"Love this! Exactly right for steampunk.<br />Only thing is that the ring for the clasp broke first time I tried to use it. I was able to hook it up to the end of the bracelet anyway, but only worked because my wrists are small!"
4.0,"Fits as expected, fast shipping.  Only downside is it's a thinner material so don't expect the long sleeves to keep you warm."
4.0,Nice style though size varies by color.
4.0,I love this dress it fit perfectly the only reason I didn’t give it a 5 was because when you walk it tends to go up on your waist so I had to constantly keeping putting it down overall it was great
4.0,"Great idea and practical for some shoes, not quite large enough for other types of shoes, such as wedges.  Hope they will make a larger size to wear with slip on wedges.  Might help if they came in small, medium and large - for differing shoes and shoe sizes."
4.0,These are for the 8 and under crowd but a huge hit no matter what.
4.0,These shirts and super light and comfy. They definitely shrunk in the dryer though so I will only hang dry from now on.
4.0,love it. super cute. my only thing is the button on the back broke so i have to sew a new one but that's ok
4.0,"The V-neck area was a little too revealing.You have to wear an inner sando but otherwise,fitting in terms of arms and length is fine."
4.0,"Purchased Fleece Lined Leggings for Women High Waisted Tummy Control Winter Warm Leggings -Reg&Plus Size (3 Pack Black,Gray,Wine, Plus Size(L-XL Size 14-20)).  With butt and gut they were a little snug.  A little tugging got them over my stomach.  They are warm and did not slip down."
4.0,Shorts were a bit unfitting but its super cute
4.0,Size up. These are small.
4.0,"I got this for my daughter who is 4'11 and about 125 lbs. She usually wears a medium, but I sized up just in case. This fits her well. Its not the thickest hoody material, but it looks as advertised and doesn't appear to have any flaws. It goes perfect with the BTS (Suga) sneakers I bought as well!"
4.0,This is great of you want to keep it modest. Fits as expected
4.0,"The quality and weight of the material are excellent. It’s hefty yet light and cool. The top is very stretchy too. The orange color is what I ordered, the top color orange is pretty bright almost to bright especially compared to the lovely rich orange shade of the skirt, I personally did not like the contrast. Would have given 5 stars and kept the dress if not for that. Will order another color. Great dress otherwise!"
4.0,"Whoever thought of this product should be highly praised because it is the most amazing piece of material that will help you trim off belly fat. All you have to do is put it on and go work out. When you have completed that work out take the belt off and you will see just how much absorption it is collecting. I have been trying to lose my belly fat since I gave birth to my daughter 2 years ago. And this sure has been helping me lose belly fat. I wear it when I'm cleaning the house, when I'm at work and also when I work out."
4.0,"for the most part I like these,  however there is not much arch support to speak of,  I got them to use around the house so I did not have to wear shoes all day."
4.0,The sizes were not exactly what I was expecting.
4.0,"The dress is super cute and you can definitely dress it up. The material is different on the top vs the bottom ( a little stiffer not as flowly). The length is good, I'm 5'5 and it hits right below my knee. As for sizing, I am normally a size 20, so I ended up<br />Buying the 4x. I will say it fits tight but I have a larger chest, so expected on top. Overall I believe this is a good purchase."
4.0,Very useful product in daily use. The quality of the product is really durable and of great quality. The product look is very good.
4.0,Wear and wash very nicely
4.0,Very Pretty. Nice sparkle to Them. A bit larger then expected but still great quality item.
4.0,I do like this but it runs large by at least 1 size if not 2.
4.0,"Good quality, nice fit. This is very cheeky in the back."
4.0,"The big ball was turned a little bit, but its very pretty."
4.0,Beautiful art on the shoe.  Sizes run large.  Hard to fit someone.
4.0,Cute dress. Straps are uncomfortable and start part way under armpit. But I cut them off and the dress is great now. Super long. I am 5 foot 7 inches and dress touches floor.
4.0,"When I got it in the mail, it wasn't the same red on the model. It was a burgundy color. But, it still fit though."
4.0,The colors are wonderful.  The pants are a very thin material tho.
4.0,"For the price, this is cute.  It's got an adorable little &#34;diamond ring&#34; on a chain inside.  This is sized for a full grown woman.  I bought 3 as presents for grandchild and nieces, but it's a little big for them.  Will hold on to these for a couple of years.  Sweet."
4.0,Beautiful dress...nice quality
4.0,This dress is perfect. The material is a perfect thickness. it is very comfortable. Great dress for the fall.
4.0,"I ordered this shirt for my wife. She normally wears between a large and extra large, so I ordered a large. The major con is that the shirt is quite big on her and she feels it looks more like a maternity shirt. The pros: The feel of the material is very soft and light.  She likes the lace in the front and back and the flowy shape of the shirt."
4.0,It a nice jackets  not light weights but it too big so am going to rneturn it
4.0,I feel that the material could've been better but my daughter loves it and can't wait to wear it for Halloween
4.0,"I’m 5’7 and 140 and ordered a small. Fits good and it was delivered when it said it would. So I’m happy with that. However, it came with a little hole where the belt goes. Also, it’s not sweater material it’s a stretchy fabric."
4.0,"Super cute, very see through… might work well for the beach though"
4.0,"I got a medium but was a lot bigger than I thought, I’m noya sized but chubby so it doesn’t really matter"
4.0,Looks great as expected. Runs a little big.
4.0,Good small sun blocker
4.0,"I bought this shirt to wear at work and to a family gathering this week. I bought it at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review of the product. This shirt is very casual and I can wear it anywhere. I can dress it up or wear it with blue jeans. It is very soft and feels great, which is the best part of it. I enjoy wearing comfortable clothes to work and this was perfect. It is very light and really good for summer. The only thing is that it is shorter than I expected. I expected it to go past my button and zipper and it is at my pants line instead. The color is pretty. I wore it today to work and did get two compliments on it. I'm very pleased with this shirt and I do plan on purchasing more items from the seller very soon."
4.0,"Larger than they appear, but well made"
4.0,They are very flimsy.  Stones fell off taking them out of the bag.  But you get a lot for the money.  The are cool looking when you light them up. Best part
4.0,"I bought three of these on the advice of my podiatrist. I had a very painful bone spur in my right heel. After wearing these for several months, the pain is nearly gone. Just remember that you have to wear it for a while for the insole to take a set to your foot, it is then very comfortable."
4.0,"Although the design is the same across the board with different color palettes, these are still good socks that add a nice pop of color. They fit like dress socks, thin and slightly low on the calf but they stay up, which is always the desired effect."
4.0,"Not a great value for my money, but they were good in a pinch"
4.0,Smaller than what i though but i like it
4.0,"This shirt perfect, but asian guys should buy one size down."
4.0,Well worth what I paid. Had no idea the green one was glow in the dark! Only problem is that after a week or so it started running wrong and rubbed my wrist raw in one spot. I fixed that by using one side of my original fit bit band. Still looked freaking awesome. All's got here pretty quick. Though the pic is of one of each that I ordered I reached the blue one since it rubbed and it fixed the problem
4.0,Wife was looking for bras without underwire and comparable to SKIM. This one offers moderate support and is comfortable. The cups are nicely molded and the bands around ribs is a perfect fit. I give a smooth appearance underneath a t-shirt and no spillage. Wish it provided a little more lift.
4.0,I usually go for a med but I looked at the reviews before hand and saw that they run small so the large one worked pretty well. They are very soft and I wear them often. They are not the length I was expecting either. They are alittle lower than calf length. Very comfortable!
4.0,"Works right out of the box.  Pairing is super simple.  Battery comes about 50% charged.<br /><br />While i havent used it for phone calls yet.  I havent stopped using it since i opened the box.  It has all but replaced everything except my computer gaming headset.<br /><br />Good sound quality, clear and comfortable for long wear.  11hrs at work and was just like wearing a normal hat.<br /><br />My only con is that it is non operational while charging."
4.0,"This is a very heavy necklace and the chain isn't that long. Overall a good product, but didn't like how heavy it is. The owl is kind of hollow as well. It is unique and interesting though.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please click the Helpful button.    <br /><br />How I rate items:<br /><br />1 Star:  (I hate it!!!):  I would NOT recommend.<br />2 Stars:  (I don’t like it):  But, the product has some slight redeeming quality.<br />3 Stars:  (It’s OK):  Others may like it more than I do<br />4 Stars:  (I like it):  Good product, but it may have some minor issues<br />5 Stars:  (I love it!!!):  Perfect item and I will recommend it."
4.0,This bag is really cute!  The straps are heavy duty and the bag is very good quality.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it had a musty smell.  I hung it outside on the clothes line in hopes to air out the smell.  :)
4.0,"i ordered a Large because it was the only size they had on stock, and i was so happy i did! These run very small! I am 5.9, 145 pounds, and the bottom part barely fit my hips. The dress is short, you will need pants or something underneath. But, this costume is actually a nice material, and fairly comfortable! I wore it for about 5 hours and went rollerblading in it, and it did great. Just wear a shirt underneath, since it does get itchy."
4.0,Love the dress but should order a size up...or 2. I prefer to wear it backwards its longer in the (supposed to be) front. Very comfey but sleeves are a bit tight more like 3/4 or half sleeve. Other than that i love it#
4.0,"Product is as advertised.  Nice design, size, and weight"
4.0,"Summary: So I’m rating 9/10 cause the discoloration is a bit discouraging like I said but overall I am happy with this product.<br /><br />Detailed: So I’ve had this for 7 days and I take it off every other day about 2-3hrs max for charging. When I got this thing in the mail it was toilet paper white!! In 7 days this thing is grey… I work in a law office so the worse (dirtiest) my wrist hits - is my desk, car center concole, my bedsheets, maybe the dog hair around the house. So this much discoloration in such a short time is honestly sad.<br /><br />All in all it is extremely comfortable I forgot I am wearing my watch at time. The Velcro clips are strong never have any issues of them coming undone. Even when washing my hands."
4.0,Like this dress! Should have ordered 1 size down but wasn't available. I still wear it. Altered a little and fits great.
4.0,"I have large, heavy breasts and really wanted to try these. I read the reviews and was a bit confused by them. Some said yes with large breasts, some said no. Well, I love them! They work great. Yes, one size larger would have been better, but I would buy again and probably will. They stuck even in the heat and they didn’t crease my breasts."
4.0,I 💕 unicorns! Wig is not the highest quality but it's decent enough. It's also turquoise and has ears and a horn xoxo
4.0,This was amazing it was awesome to put on my only issue is that the controller skins where tough to put on but thats my fault i love the decal its fantastic im a horror fan and you hit the mark with my collection i might buy more who knows thank you
4.0,Run a tad smaller in my opinion<br />This robe is so soft It's what I imagine a cloud to feel.<br />Like seriously super soft. Seems to be made decently. But the colors are lighter then the picture. I do like like that elsa looks like elsa and isn't disfigured.  Very happy apart from it running a tad small<br />My oldest picked it out for my youngest form xmas and we can't wait to give it to her.
4.0,"Overall really cute costume!  Runs a little small through the top ( I normally wear M and this was a little tight in the bust), thinner material, and the skirt is a little short ( I'm 5'8"") but going to wear bike shorts under the skirt."
4.0,"I love the look of this dress. I wore it for family photos and everyone has commented on how cute it was. I have a large chest and it fit well. Im short 5'3 and the length was right above my knee. The only issue is the shoulders and upper arm area is tight and doesn't allow you to hold your arms above your head. It feels odd to loose some arm movement. The dress doesn't have much stretch, but it was still comfortable. It was a nice thick fabric and wasn't at all see though. I will probably wear it to work at some point in the future."
4.0,"I love the sweater, but there was no wash instruction tag on the sweater and no wash instructions in the package, so I hope it comes out alright when I go to wash it."
4.0,They are good quality and cute. Make sure you notice that they are slim fit. They aren't stretchy enough if your child isn't slim.
4.0,4/5 stars because color of picture does not match item fully. The red that is pictured is much more vibrant. The one I received looks more faded. Otherwise really comfortable band. Keeps your wrist from sweating.
4.0,as advertised. seem to be quality.
4.0,"I was worried this wallet would be too thick and hard to sit on considering it was aluminum, but that has not been the case. It is very comfortable in my pocket, no thicker than the last wallet that I have been using for over 10 years. There is plenty of room for cards and the wallet appears to be pretty well built.<br />My only issue has been with the money strap. The bills have a tendency to slip out when I pull the wallet from my pocket. This is not a design flaw necessarily, as the strap is tight and there is a small sticky rubber piece under the strap to help hold, but I will probably put my bills, especially the larger ones in the wallet instead of under the strap.<br />I do not have a way to test the RFID claims, but the aluminum should block attempts to scan RFID codes from cards.<br />Overall, this is a good wallet at a reasonable price."
4.0,Nice lightweight  and good fit
4.0,"Great color and material. Like others said, even though it was found when searching swimsuit coverups, I will not be wearing it as that.  It is too short for a coverup in my opinion.  I do think it will be really cute with a pair of navy shorts though! Great outfit for an evening after being at the beach/pool!"
4.0,"The armpit holes are pretty big, and definitely show my bra I found I put my arms up. It's really comfortable, though, but I'll definitely wear his with a jacket so I don't go flashing my students."
4.0,"If you really want compression maybe go a size smaller.<br /><br />The company contacted me recently.  While they do not make a size that would fit me for compression (150 lbs, 5'8) they provided a discount and I will use the shirts as regular T-shirts.  As a T-shirt, they are nice quality and nice material.  Seem well made and the seller was attentive so I am increasing the star count."
4.0,"Was not as flattering, has great stretch was comfortable but was expecting a thicker material. Still a nice 👗"
4.0,I love it. I just took 1 star off as the headband does loose elasticity
4.0,Super cute pack- literally has all colors and love all the different styles. The only thing I dislike is how quickly they tarnish so definitely use some clear nail polish on the nickel parts.
4.0,"The &#34;Woot!&#34;: solid, good design, very effective<br /><br />The &#34;Meh.&#34;: tends toward the larger side of the stated range, had a few small rough spots<br /><br />The &#34;9-10&#34; size I got is definitely closer to a EUR 43 than a 41 or 42. I wear a 42, and in dress shoes, these shoe trees fill up the space as much as my actual feet. With the trees in place, the springs are still about halfway compressed. In boots, I usually leave the heels partway out and don't bother compressing everything to get the trees all the way in place, because getting them out is an effort. I don't think there is enough tension here to actually stretch shoes of good quality leather, but they most certainly will prevent creasing and hold the shoes in shape. A couple of spots near where the screws/ bolts for the brass tubes and springs was added to the wood had rough edges, but the shaping in general was nicely smooth. If I had it to do again, I'd go slightly smaller, at least for boots.<br /><br />This kind of design, with the bigger springs providing lengthwise tension and the little section in the toe box pushing gently outward, is definitely better than the simple spoon kind. Sure, either kind will help your shoes to dry out between wearings, but you also need to help them not get creased and sad-looking. If you just paid $200 or more for good shoes, and you plan to take care of them so they last literally the rest of your life, then spending $20 or less for something like this is how you start."
4.0,Why are t there enough feathers for all the dream catchers?
4.0,Debe manejarse por tallas y una buena descripcion
4.0,Super cute dress. Great fit and material. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I think a waist tie or thin belt would have made it perfect.
4.0,"These are a great fit over clothing, they're durable and the color is fun. I'm using them specifically to make a Halloween costume, but they would work for real cases as well. My one complaint is the proportions are off. I'm 5'10&quot; and fairly evenly proportioned and the length of the top half is just barely long enough while the legs are easily 3 inches too long. Even if they were tailored to fit around the waist tightly as high as possible the legs would still be a good 1.5&quot; too long! I used hemming tape and it seems to be holding up well. I'm not sure it can be washed though."
4.0,"If your skinniest part is exactly in the middle of your torso, as mine is, then this will be flattering.  I'm thin but have a large ribcage, so the thinnest part of my waist is in a different place than most women (which I think is usually right below the bust).  For me, this works out well.<br /><br />And PS, one side has the stipes matching up perfectly, the left side not so much.  I noticed that was the case in the model picture, so I wasn't expecting perfection.  It's soft, stretchy, and has pockets that don't seem to add bulk, and it seems it would be perfect to throw on over a swimsuit for some modesty if running from the pool or beach right to a restaurant or shopping.<br /><br />I got the red striped version in Medium, which seems to fit me well (I'm 5'7"", 140#) with long legs and shorter torso, it hits me just below the knee at the hem.  Not the most beautiful dress I own, but nice for those ""not trying too hard but want to look decent"" kind of days."
4.0,The product performs well for making the arms appear slim and also provides light compression.  I only wish the garment was made of material that did not &#34;run&#34; and thereby last longer.
4.0,"Good quality. We had purchased them for outdoor winter activities, but they are extremely thin. Best for indoors face coverings."
4.0,Did not relieve these earrings.
4.0,super cute but wish the dogs were on the top of the foot
4.0,Nice belt.  Comfortable. A little too wide.
4.0,"This this is really tall in person! The legs are long, but since the costume is so tall, the legs bunch up at the bottom so you don't actually have that much room to walk, if that makes sense.<br />It inflates quickly and stays full until you unzip it. The air pump does tend to drain the batteries, but it has a USB cable, so you could plug it into a little portable battery charger so it will last all night.<br />Keep in mind that this can be hard to walk in, has limited vision, and you can't use your fingers, so you'll have fun and get laughs, but you won't be able to function! Still worth it, in my opinion."
4.0,Not to my liking
4.0,Good quality leather. Buckle is a bit larger than desired but it works for a watch requiring a 24mm band. I used it for my 42mm Apple Watch and it makes it look awesome. Wish there was an option for a darker color buckle to match the watch.
4.0,Love them however I only received 11 pairs. Had to take away 1 star
4.0,"Soft material with a little bit of give, and a loose, A-line cut.  I'm petite, and the fit is mostly flattering, except I find that the tops of the pockets fall in an odd location due to my height.  They should be a couple of inches higher.  I realize that the feature of the dress is low-placed pockets - but they're a little too low on me."
4.0,"My husband likes the shirt. The weight of the fabric is not too heavy like some corduroy shirts can be, and size and fit was perfect."
4.0,"Super cute, super cheap can't complain about it. However it isn't exactly the most well made item (hence the price) I tore it twice just putting it on."
4.0,"I loved how it adjusted, and it fits my wrist and looks great. Cant wait to buy different colors."
4.0,"I bought these to help keep my uniform shirt from coming untucked. Figured, if they didnt work, i was only out a little bit of money.They actually work fairly well. The only complaint I have is that the jaws don't exert enough bite on the shirt to hold it in place. By folding the bottom of the shirt first, it doubles the material the jaws have to clamp onto, and that solves the problem."
4.0,"It is very transparent but also very pretty and fits well. Definitely happy with it, and likely getting it in another color"
4.0,"Not bad for people who likes this design and not branded products (no logo)! Material feels very nice and light, and the cut is well. They could've sew better the zipper on the back side because that part of the trunks looks a little bit poor quality. Everything else is good for the money!"
4.0,It fitted me perfectly it was just to short for my liking.... Looks like picture and material is nice.  But way to short and I'm 5'2
4.0,"This is a very nice dress.  The pockets are deep and the fit is good.  I am 5 ft. 110 lbs and ordered an XS.  The sleeves are too long, which I expected since I am petite, and I have already hemmed them to a more comfortable length.  Someone taller will probably think they are fine.  The dress hits right below my knees when I am standing, again because I am on the short side.<br />I read many reviews before I purchased this so I knew it was a thin fabric.  I just want to reiterate to potential buyers, that the fabric is so thin, you can see through it when held up to the light.  The pocket is deep enough to hold my phone, but the fabric is so thin, the weight of my phone pulls the dress down noticeably on one side.  I will have to wear a long sleeved t-shirt and a sweater to make this dress warm enough to wear in the winter."
4.0,Love it and it is actually very big size.
4.0,"UPDATE: The seller sent me a new pair at no cost. Such awesome customer service. I have changed my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars!<br /><br />I was hesitant to purchase these because in comparison to a lot of similar options, these were a lot more expensive but they were everything I was looking for so I decided to do it. When they came, I was very happy with my purchase UNTIL at about the 6-month mark, having only worn them maybe a dozen times. One of the earrings started separating, like the back from the front of the leather was coming apart. It was just a little bit and since it was past the time to return I thought I would just try to be extra careful because I really did love them. Unfortunately, things only got worse and soon they were completely separated. like two pieces of leather hanging from one earring. Because I love them so much a have glued them back together. It is ok for now but when you look close you can see the glue is some of the little holes. I am just disappointed at the quality seeing as how expensive these were. I have some that were 1/4 of the cost that are holding up great. I have some pics I will upload when Amazon allows the add photos again."
4.0,When will the clothing Industry agree on a sizing standard!!!  I am glad most US products are regulated by an ANSI standard!!
4.0,Hat went well with my 1920s ensemble
4.0,Looks good.  Was a gift for a friend's and she likes it.
4.0,These undershirt fit perfectly and soft on the skin feels like I am not wearing anything
4.0,"This dress would look great on a thin, 20 year old  women.  I am a heavy set 70+ year old woman with less than perfect legs. This dress is really short and certainly not flattering on me. I will be returning this item."
4.0,"I love this mini dress.  I wore it over leggings as it is a little too short for me.at 5'7""  I am 50 and love to be stylish and this dress is just that, wrinkle resistant & very comfortable"
4.0,"A lot bigger than I anticipated! It hasn't broken, and no gems have lost their place. A decent buy!"
4.0,"Bold and unique! These glasses have a nice cat eye shape that flatters the face and stands out in the crowd! The mirrored border rims are a lovely touch especially since there are skulls nestled in the lattice, which I adore! The only reason for the lack of a star is that there is a lot of adhesive around the rims that take away from the shininess and I'm picking it off (while I'm writing this). Otherwise for the price you cannot go wrong!"
4.0,"Good quality, it looks so cute"
4.0,Great !! According to my expectations !! Tks
4.0,"Cute top, but runs small."
4.0,Not an issue though. I knew I was going to have to alter
4.0,"My booty, I think (know), was a little too big. This would be good for someone who is slightly smaller than I. I loved the fabric, loved the look."
4.0,"The company did everything to satisfied me to have a great experience with their product. I love my bangle, I wear it every day. If you buy any product form them you will love it."
4.0,"This is a soft tank that fits well. I am 5'8"", 140, and a 36D. I ordered a medium and it fit fine. The straps don't adjust, but the level seems fine. Support is light. It has light padding to prevent nipples from poking out too much."
4.0,"This is such a great dress. It's very flattering on, especially when worn with a crinoline underskirt. It runs very small so be sure to look at their sizing. I ordered two sizes larger than I normally wear and it turned out great. Be prepared to iron, it arrives very wrinkled."
4.0,I like them but padding wears away
4.0,Very nice. The coins have broken off but that's probably due to my handling of them.
4.0,This dress is close to perfect for what I was looking for.<br />Pros-<br />Affordable<br />Flattering<br />Material has some stretch<br />Cons-<br />Thin material<br />Too short (I’m 5’7)<br />Doesn’t come in many color options<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this dress…I ordered a medium and will exchange it for a large - mainly for more length and a bit of a looser fit
4.0,I bought for my wife and she love it. It fits amazing on her. Great deal!!!
4.0,This fits great on my daughter and also has room for her to grow. Very happy with this purchase!
4.0,"I didn't like the way it tied over the shoulder so I turned the dress backwards, threaded the tie through and tie it in the back (which was originally the front of the dress."
4.0,"I bought these cooling scarves for my grandchildren to use during their visit to our home in Las Vegas. They love to help us walk the dogs and they wore these cooling scarves every day.  We kept the scarves wet and stored them in the refrigerator when we weren't  using them.  When they left for Oklahoma I sent their scarves with them and they are still enjoying them.  I have 3 scarves left for future use.  I would have given these cooling scarves a 5 rating if they had been wider, but they are still a good buy for the price."
4.0,"great fit , soft material"
4.0,Nice quality and price is awesome. Super cute!
4.0,Material is a lil itchy. Fits a lil small. Great for the price.
4.0,"I've been looking for a google set like this, perfect fit and very comfortable, I use this daily for swimming exercise, it would have been perfect set for me except for the fog"
4.0,Looks great!!!!!<br />Slightly tight on sleeve
4.0,"These are a really good pair of boots, they can really get the job done. Although once you first put them on and play, the back of the collar (rubber strip) can give you blisters, but you just have to break that part in.  Besides that, they are a really good pair of futbal boots"
4.0,"Finally a pair of long inseam shorts that I can wear to work!<br />I ordered an XL (but normally wear a L) and like the fit.<br /><br />Pro: long inseam, big pockets, comfortable fabric, colors don’t run in wash. I never dried them in a dryer, only hung dry.<br /><br />Con: does make a swish sound when I walk because I have thick thighs and those babies rub together.<br /><br />Overall I love these shorts. I bought them in all colors!"
4.0,"It was definitely fitted! I ordered a large, I normally wear a 10. It was fitted but not overly tight. More snug than I was hoping though."
4.0,Nice socks.  liked most colors.Would definitely recommend.
4.0,We got a 4T. The pants are long and normal size but the shirt is way too narrow. The design is good but the sizing is so off that my daughter can’t wear it and even if I bought a 5T I think it’d still have the same issue- plenty long but too narrow.
4.0,Wasn't as long as I was hoping but overall a nice top for the price
4.0,I guess I just need to use them to break them in. Fit perfectly.
4.0,"The glasses did not fit when they arrived.  It turned out that one lens was not fully installed in the frame, which was easy for me to remedy.  Now they fit better and I look forward to using them on the golf course!"
4.0,Very nice and looks masculine when you wear it.... Good product and unique compared to most bracelets.. Happy with purchase.. For the price you cannot go wrong. .
4.0,"Nice and thin to keep in my bag.  While it fits exact, I could have gone a size up."
4.0,I like the material and it's strong too.
4.0,"I like it but the clasp really sucks with this type of bead.  It not only makes it hard to take on and off but it also rolls on the neck and will just fall off.  Got this for my husband who is a chef and it almost fell into the food.  Since I make jewelry I fixed the issue by restringing it and choosing my own clasp, but I really hate beading so yeah that pissed me off.  May I suggest using a crimp bead or some sort of lock spacer in between the bead and the bead and the clasp.  That would prevent rolling if you use a different shape and would allow for some room to grab it and twirl to put it on, making it easier on us.  I love the beads but I could have just purchases a string a beads and done it myself since that's what I had to do to fix the clasp.  Really pretty hematite and my husband loved it since he didn't have to fix it, meeeehhh.  Please go to youtube and get better ideas or test your jewelry on yourself and see what happens.  Thanks.  Would buy again if you changed your technique of the clasp."
4.0,"I like the colors that are on the band, they look exactly as pictured. I also like the fact that the holes allow for breathing room so my wrist isn’t sweating"
4.0,Nice little purse. Wears like iron.
4.0,"I find them a bit small in length.  I use them for pilates and the size does not affect the workout.<br /><br />I'm a 10.5 - 11 men's shoe.  The silicon traction barely reaches my heal.  The pinky toe is also too large/long for my toe, but that's just my foot more than a design flaw.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, you won't find a better value!"
4.0,One bag received with side tip about 2 inches. Appears to be poor QC.
4.0,"My 34 F titties looked good af, but alas it is a BOOBY shirt so beware if you dont like to bring attention to the room ;) ALSO THE TIES WERE CONFUSING AF AT FIRST LOL"
4.0,Super cute but far too big.
4.0,"Great shirt, runs a bit small"
4.0,"I purchased these for my 9 week old and they are a little large, but I'm sure she'll grow into them. The care instructions state that you must hand wash - which is very true as the bow part is just tied around the headband and not sewed on. The fabric is kind of thin, which is preferable for me in the summer. Very cute colors to match lots of outfits. Update: My daughter is now one and a half and the headbands fit her really well. I've machine washed in a lingerie bag and sometimes I have to tie the bows back on, but they have been very durable overall."
4.0,Love the bracelet.  Design was perfectly represented and thebquality is excellent.  My only complaint is the clasp mechanism will allow the bracelet to open and fall off the wrist if bumped against something in just the right way.  It has happened a few times since I purchased it a year ago.  Thankfully it is heavy enough that it doesnt go unnoticed.
4.0,"Cute, easy to carry, good quality and lots of room!!!  Love it!!"
4.0,This dress is pretty. I was very satisfied with it.
4.0,Fits well. Comfortable. After a few wash and wears it gets stringy along the hems.
4.0,"Fits great. It was a hit at the party and I got a lot of compliments. Like other reviews, there is a high pitch noise when lit, but when you are at a party with music and conversation you don't notice it. Unless you keep the battery pack/switch right next to your ear, the noise is not bothersome.<br /><br />I gave it 4 out 5 stars because of the wire attachment. It is about 3.5ft long and I can clip it to my pocket. If there's a product like this out there where it maybe uses the tiny lithium batteries and a switch as part of the glass frame itself, minus high pitch noise of course, then it would be a perfect 5/5. Still highly recommended!"
4.0,Super cute T-shirt but I got a men’s large for a white elephant and it was small for a men’s large. But it was a hit.
4.0,I love the pattern I’m very short 4’9 so I’m definitely going to need a little alteration on the leg part I ordered a size small I’m 118 pounds just for reference which fit well. I like that it had adjustable straps also it’s going to be great for the summer time.
4.0,Fantastic Color.  runes HUGE. I'm 5'2&#34; 135lbs and a Medium was like a sheet on me. reordered in small hope it fits better
4.0,"I was looking for the perfect Coach wristlet like my daughter had bought from an outlet store. I could not find one so decided to check out Amazon for one. No luck finding it. I had certain requirements; most importantly an outside area for my iPhone 6 Plus. I searched for days and found this one. It is perfect. Bonus: It has a zippered outside pocket that fits my phone and is easily removed In a hurry. Also, a smaller zippered pocket on the opposite side. The inside has divided areas with 8 slots for credit cards, etc. If that isn't enough, it has another zippered pocket as well. I carry lipstick, gum, money and tissues without it being bulky. The zippers are not top-of-the-line but seem sturdy and easily zipped. The material is fairly soft and pliable. I choose the navy blue color. It is rich looking. Quite pleased for the price. I would have paid 3-4 times that much for a Coach, and I'm thinking the quality wouldn't be much better. So I'm fine without the Coach label."
4.0,Glasses work good for night driving and rain but can't tell they are polarized on glare and the make glass look like yellow mirrors.
4.0,"A little irritating at first, but is fine after a few hours. Plastic posts and a good selection of earrings. Good for the money"
4.0,I went off the suggested size based on measurements and the fit was great.  My daughter wore it for a flower girl dress.  My only reason for not giving it a 5 star is the fabric is super thin and see through.  Otherwise this is a great product.
4.0,"The material is super soft and stretchy, love the design and of course the price. The removal cup pads are sturdy too not like the thin flimsy ones. I ordered a size 6 and for reference I’m a 34B, 5’6”, ~130 lbs, small in most tops, athletic-normal build (not huge lats/traps) just a wider rib cage and smaller cup size. I think if you’re in between sizes I would size UP I don’t think I would mind the next size up for slightly less compression. Definitely think a size 2/4 in this would be considered an XS"
4.0,Really liked the shirt. Looks good. Got a lot of compliments while wearing it. The only con is that it was short in length than I thought.
4.0,"Cute, vibrant colors. Theres two battery packs to run two separate fans. I wore jeans under the costume and slipped them in the front pockets. No issues. There’s little pockets for them sewn in the costume but in those it weighted the costume more and the costume already wanted to slip downward.  Additionally about the fans they,  a bit, underperformed. Walking, every few seconds the head would droop and you felt it deflating a little. Stop walking and the fan would catch up and reinflate. I walked with the grands with my hand under “the human leg” of the costume—-  grasped costume under there to help support the costume against gravity. It wouldn't have fallen off with what i was wearing under but it set oddly on the leg and walking was awkward.  The leg of the costume wasn't the full leg in me so my stride was restricted. Was ok for what we did. I”m 5’4”. Not long bodied nor short legged."
4.0,Nice. Just not a good fit.
4.0,Attractive suit but it was too small even getting a size up from normal.  There was also no support (no underwire) for my Ds.
4.0,runs a little small...the feathers that come with are cheap..however its a sexy showgirl vamp robe..the cut is very cute..great for theater .drag..showgirls
4.0,Nice watches
4.0,It was a gift to a guitarist and he likes it
4.0,Order at least one size bigger
4.0,"Cute dress! I ordered a medium (5'2&#34;, 34DD) and it was the perfect length to wear with flats (I'd need it longer for wedges or heels personally), dots are a little larger than I anticipated (but true to size if you enlarge the picture). This dress is VERY sheer! Not a real problem for me because I have a slip I can wear under it, but it's an added inconvenience so I took off one star. Seems to be made well (no irregular hems or loose stitching), light cottony feel. I like the fact the hem in front is taken up slightly so I don't trip on it while walking!"
4.0,"Tough to get it in, but the soul of the party"
4.0,"Works great, rolls smoothly, but the little emblem was knocked out of place when I had to planeside check my bag. Basically it’s good if airline staff aren’t handling it. The hard outer shell keeps everything safe on the inside and there are several zippered compartments to keep certain items separate."
4.0,"If you are ordering this has a Christmas gift you better order in November. I ordered mine the 5th of December and didn't receive it until January 13th. However, the company did work with me in trying to figure out why I had not received it. They also sent me another one as compensation. I was very pleased with the item that I ordered. It was very well made. It was a gift for my granddaughter who takes piano and she loved it!!"
4.0,"Fits true to size with not a lot of give. I am 5’3” and petite. I got small. Fits perfectly, but the skirt is longer for my shorter self. Material is thin and slightly see through, so be careful when ordering a color other than black. Overall for price, it’ll work!"
4.0,Great design and color Rides up a bit on the thighs and a little thin but can’t see through it. It’s sexy and fun. Get it!
4.0,Perfect for a summer shirt jacket. I will wear it over sleeveless summer dresses. Denim jacket with collar would be too bulky. This is exactly what I was looking for thin and light.
4.0,The clasp was difficult to open the first time.  I emailed the seller for instructions and they responded right away.  Beautiful and excellent quality.  I would have given it a five if it weren't for the clasp. Bracelet arrived right on time.
4.0,"great buy. a lil flimsy, but they will work for the photo booth use i was planning. great colors"
4.0,Will not use some of the colors. Would have liked to be able to select colors I could use.
4.0,I love the whole assemble. The hat is my favorite item by far. The bracelet has unattached from the metal part but it's fixable.
4.0,I like it but it should have had more elastic in the waist seeing that you can't wear or with a belt.
4.0,"Arrived in nice packaging with a bonus washing bag. Much nicer than bras I've paid 4x for. Only consideration is front does show if wearing a deep-cut v-neck, but is fine with most tops."
4.0,It was perfect! I made a charm bracelet for my sister and it turned out beautiful.
4.0,"I ordered the green in a XL and I am 5ft 7 and it fit my curves well! It is a gorgeous bright grass green color. The stiching and overall build of the dress is wonderful, and I cannot wait to wear it to my next event im invited to!"
4.0,"Es un buen producto, conozco la  marca hace año. no doy 5 estrellas por qué pensé que podía ser un poco mas acolchado, pero en general son cómodas."
4.0,"These socks are super soft and cozy! I’m a US women’s 9, and these fit me perfectly! Thick enough to wear under my doc martens but not too thick that they’re uncomfortable, and I think they’ll be warm enough for the Oregon winter!"
4.0,"The construction is sturdy, finish and color look nice.  I was, however, a little disappointed that a normal sized key, such as the very common Schlage, will not fit on the main ring...the bar is too large forcing the use of the smaller split rings to carry regular sized keys.  I wanted a ring that was an ""easy load;""  this ring definitely is not.  The split rings are very tight, which yes, will securely hold the keys, but it takes something, other than very strong fingernails, to open the ring; I used a computer flat blade screwdriver."
4.0,"Fits perfect! I'm 5'7, 155 lbs, waist 29 hips 39 & it fits me big. I was worried since in the photo it was an Asian woman & it's from China & Asian clothes run so small.<br />Only complaint I had about it is the material is so thin. I have to wear a tank top underneath or else you can see my bra. Just wish it was thicker like a sweater."
4.0,My wife loves it but we don't know how to take it off! Help!
4.0,"I love these! I had to modify them to where they could go in, because rhey wouldnt go in without the pain being too much. I cut off the back lip, and now they fit perfectly!  They almost don't fit, but if you lube them up, they go right in! I love the variety of colors you get for the price! It's totally worth it."
4.0,"Okay, I like this shirt but it is sooooo long, if I wasn't able to tuck it into my jeans it would literally be a dress on me, and it took months to come. It's a pretty shirt tho, a little on the thin side but cute fabric"
4.0,"I ordered these gloves to keep my hands warm doing barn and farm chores. They are very comfortable and kept my hands dry even when briefly submerged in water troughs. However,  there was a small rip in the seam of the finger within the first hour of use. Hopefully they will hold up with continued use."
4.0,"Because of Asian sizes I ordered up, but ended up returning because too big. Ordered the smaller size fits nicely but honestly is not that comfortable. It's a little itchy and it's so pretty you want to wear something that shows it off but it's not quite the right style for me to wear on its own"
4.0,So glad I tried these.
4.0,I am 5'5 and 130 lbs size small fit me well.
4.0,Perfect for comfort. Only complaint is it faded. Washed in cold and hung dry. Slightly peeling but not bad. Very very comfortable and that why the 5 stars.
4.0,Great color selection.
4.0,It was wearable but somewhat on the small side compared to most other shirt I own....
4.0,I dunno if they totally suit my face but they are cute and I do get compliments on them.
4.0,I'm normally an xl but after looking at other reviews saying that it ran small I ordered a xxxl it fits me. The arms are a bit baggy. And it's alot longer than I expected. It almost looks like a house robe or something. I might try to take it up a bit. But all in all its pretty and it fits so I'll give it 4 stars
4.0,One size fits “most” is a gamble. I was pleasantly surprised it fit; although it was a bit tight in the hip area. I’m naturally curvaceous and had to refer to the pic to remind me what it was supposed to look like... I would buy this again
4.0,"They are pretty, but I have long skinny legs and these slip down. After a few minutes of walking they are down to my ankles. They are lose. Maybe better for thicker legs."
4.0,"This seems like a decent shoe. I haven't worn them out yet, but they fit as expected. I usually were a 7 and I ordered a half size larger. They fit well with a little extra toe room because I want to wear socks with them. As for the style, they are ok. I wish the toe was round instead of a little pointy, but for the price they are acceptable. They are comfortable and cheap, so don't expect a high-quality shoe. (Sort of like a Payless shoe) If you want the combat boot look for just daily wear with jeans, these will do."
4.0,Works well. Keeps my glasses in place when I'm working and can't adjust them. Even been wearing them on the weekends.
4.0,Got compliments yay..I am a twin and she loved it so I ordered one for her.
4.0,"I get lots of compliments on these and they’re super cute. Their only flaw is that if they’re worn too long, they make your ears a little itchy."
4.0,I think they are a good value for the money
4.0,"decent product.  the price and quality is on par with others.  the sizes are ok, the mediums are perfect, the largest ones were too large for most clothing / luggage. the cost of these cubes are relatively low, higher quality (ie: zippers and fabric durability) and better pricing would greatly improve this purchase."
4.0,"Nice bag.  No shoulder strap, though."
4.0,"This is a great ring for the money. While it doesn't look very expensive, it's still makes a great sentimental gift to your mother. My mother is never seen without this ring. She wears it more than her wedding ring."
4.0,"The product is great overall. They look how they are advertised and mine even got delivered early but, you can cleary see the opalite pair is way too big. I could even tell before taking them out of the small bag they came in that they were much bigger than a 2g. Which sucks because those are the pair i was most excited for. :("
4.0,"The shorts ran a little small, but not enough that I’d return them. Fabric is soft, top is flattering and provides enough coverage. Color is really lovely.  Liked it enough that I bought another set!"
4.0,Fits nice and washes great but the words are strange and some are misspelled.  Some of them are down right funny with how bad they are. They do their job and that’s the only thing that matters I guess.
4.0,I use these for woodcutting and other rough tasks in which I need rugged gloves that also protect my wrists.  The rubber finger strips work well to reduce injury from pinching fingers.  However the seams inside on the palm are a bit rough.
4.0,"Even though it's a little big on the top, i am small there anyways. Very pretty dress!"
4.0,"Not sure this was worth the money, Not the highest quality, but my granddaughter loves it."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a3453fb08d1e0c855b028dae266968e4]] Rugged, good size pouch. The front pouch is large enough to hold a smart phone with case as well as a pen or small flash light. The two zipper containers are sizeable and divided to keep things organized. The Zipper seems both sturdy and functual. The pouch mounts securely with two straps on the back or can be attached with molle clips to a back pack or other pouch. All and all a spacious and rugged pouch. I received a discount for this product in return for my unbiased honest opinion."
4.0,Lastima
4.0,Fit good!!!
4.0,"I really liked this wig. Fist off this really long, and it sheds. the bangs do need to be fixed, maybe if you use as hot iron on very low, maybe they could be tamed. i have tried yet. it does shed a lot and tangle kind of easy. but its a great costume wig, which is what it was intended for."
4.0,Almost too soft!! They are great!
4.0,"good quality, nice fabric but not when its summer though, true to size"
4.0,"I wish they make this one in XS. I'm 5'4"" 130 lbs but it was very lose on me :/ . The color is really nice and the design too. Too bad I had o return it."
4.0,Very nice scarf. Sufficient material and washed well
4.0,"I bought these for my husband for Father's Day and he loved them, so I ordered him two more pair."
4.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and ordered a medium. A little snug in the tummy area, but the bodice is a little saggy on me. I don't have a big chest. So the bottom half fits a little more snug than the top half. Still..if I throw a cardigan over it, I can make it work!"
4.0,"I like the jacket, just needed one size up."
4.0,the waist is perfect but the legs were too long. The quality of the fabric is excellent as always. Very resistant and durable.
4.0,"Was very large and I have large wrists. Waxy type string so it wouldn't stay tight. I slipped it on my ankle and tied it, burnt the knot and now I have a sweet turtle anklet."
4.0,Its worth the money.
4.0,Very pretty! I’ve worn one pair every day (taking them off before shower/bed) and the gold paint has already started coming off from where my ear touches it. That stinks but no one can see it so I still wear them.
4.0,Material is better quality than I expected for the price. The bottom piece ran just a little bit large but overall a good buy for the price. Recommend
4.0,"They are comfy and cute but they won't last long, they are pretty thin. Still not a bad purchase."
4.0,Love this shirt just wish it was a little shorter kind of long!
4.0,"It is very beautiful bag, but it is not a large as I aspected..."
4.0,I like the band at the bottom to help the top not cling. It helps hide any extra tummy....
4.0,"I usually wear a Medium, however I ordered a Large and it fits good. The belt loop was broken before I tried it on... The color is awesome!"
4.0,It's quite pretty although I wish it fit a little closer. Overall I like it.
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and even wearing 4&#34; heels this dress was too long. I had to hold it up to walk, especially on stairs. Other than that it's super comfy and I got lots of compliments wearing it so I'm having the hem line raised."
4.0,Looks really good on me
4.0,"Some of these were too big for me so I ended up giving the big ones to a friend, I absolutely love the ones that fit. They’re my favorite chokers."
4.0,I like the colors and they're soft but the shape is a little funny
4.0,Nice facemask but kinda thin. It falls down on my sons face often which can be annoying.
4.0,"So far So Good! Like one of the other posts... the bag arrived without the key. But its not a huge deal, cause the lock doesn't really do anything anyway, and the bag would look silly without the lock. Also, like another person said, the bag is stiff, but i myself wanted that. I'm tired of bags that don't stand up and flop over. It did have a funny smell inside, but i sprayed some perfume/cologne, and its ok. I use this bag primarily for work, it is big enough to fit my umbrella, ipad, and basic essentials. So far, it is a very nice bag and i am happy. I will update this post when i have been using it longer."
4.0,"This shawl is lovely, just not big enough for how I wanted to use it. My fault for not double checking the size listed."
4.0,"This is an excellent low-cost utility watch for wear doing chores, etc. Rugged case and look give it a somewhat military feel."
4.0,Only wish had roll up handle
4.0,"It is super cute for couple keychain! However, I didn't get the expected style of keychain, I chose style 1 with the panda doing tongue-out.. But anyway, I like the style that they gave me."
4.0,"So cute, so 'pinup' but the top is very flimsy cheap material and is super big in the shoulders.  The shorts we wil keep, but the top is good for a photo, and that's it"
4.0,"Soft material, fits well"
4.0,"Great quality and strong, which is great, but tight. My 5 yr old can only wear it for pictures, not for long periods of time."
4.0,"These are really nice plugs, but they seem to be a lot smaller than all the other ones I have.  I'm a 00, but I feel like I should've gotten a size larger.  I'm going to leave my piercings open for a day or two, so they can fit without falling out."
4.0,Nice material just to small around chest area
4.0,"Shipping was fast. This was a bit larger than expected, but it is nice quality and will work nicely for my party."
4.0,Very nice outfit! Fits all curves and very stretchy material.<br />The skirt is long that's the only downside but with heels or wedges it wont be that long.<br />5&#34;7 180bbls ordered a medium.
4.0,I got the pink and it is a very pretty shirt BUT it is very thin and see through.  You'll have to wear something under it and the shoulders wouldn't stay down. I ordered based off my measurements
4.0,"I liked the pants, I just ordered a size larger than I need."
4.0,Good size! 0Bigger than i expected#:)
4.0,I really like the fit. They are very comfortable for all day wear.
4.0,"The bracelet arrived in about two weeks, which was less than the estimated time. The beads look a couple shades darker than in the pictures. I think those must have had a very bright light on them for the photographs. It's a very good quality bracelet though, and I like it a lot."
4.0,"Very attractive watch, but incomplete and incorrect information about how to remove  a link to size the band. There is no online support information that I can find from either an official website or even a youtube video. If you purchase and need to remove a link, be aware that the diagramatic instructions enclosed with your product may be incorrect. Ours showed incorrect orientation of the pins that hold the band together. Be aware that when you use the enclosed tool to remove the pin, you need to actually insert the tool through the tiny hole in the tiny disc that holds the pin in from one side. You are aiming to pop the pin out the other side. I recommend a moderate touch and a small hammer. Will update when we see how well this watch holds up."
4.0,"This set is adorable & well made! My only issue is that the hat was huge & never fit my son at the same time as the mittens- although that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with sizing.<br /><br />Overall, even better in person & the quality was decent!"
4.0,Super cute but belt is just ok. Probably going to find a better belt. But I like the dress
4.0,Good key chain. I will order more.
4.0,Like it a lot. Very classy yet comfortable.
4.0,"Is a bit weird on the hips, but fits as expected"
4.0,I like this bracelet but it is a liittle large for my wrist. It slides a little.
4.0,It’s very cute and I love to wear it but I would wear it more if it would stay on.
4.0,"People love my pendant, anytime I wear it I get compliments on how they really like it. Of course it's a little cheaper and made from plastic, but it's like a whole $4; what do you expect? You may have to repair it a little here and there, I think mine fell apart twice, but it's simple fixes and compliments most outfits."
4.0,Thin and breathable.  Loose fit.
4.0,Loved these. They were bought to be given as part of a gift. The reason they are a 4 not a 5 is because I wish the spirals went opposite ways since they are for opposite sides.
4.0,I have been buying Gloria Vanderbilt jeans for many years. The fit and material are great — great colors and a lot of stretch!!
4.0,It seemed like a high-quality product but I had to return it because it fit very snug. This item is best if you are of a slim and tiny build.
4.0,"The cups in this suit do not &#34;hold you up&#34; so if your chest is on the larger size and you're looking for support, you will not find it in this top. The top was too big and bottoms were a perfect fit but I am on the curvy side.  Otherwise, it's a very sporty bathing suit."
4.0,Nice house shoes that stay on the feet.
4.0,"Update: After my initial review the company reached out to me and was very accommodating. They replaced my damaged crystal with a new, nicer looking one as well as sent me a complimentary tigers eye necklace. Definitely 5 stars for their customer service.<br /><br />Was very excited for this to come in but I’m kinda disappointed. The crystal is not nearly as vibrant as the pictures make it seem, the color is VERY washed out and pale. And not only is it cracked, but there’s actually a hole in the center of it. Very misleading, as I thought I would be receiving a much higher quality stone based on the price, description, and pictures."
4.0,"I love this top, but instead of my usual medium, I should have gone with a Large.  Its fitted to the body, so the medium is a bit too tight for the look that the model has.  Otherwise, I do love the top.  If I were a small usually, the medium would be perfect."
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34;, 168 lbs and my dress size is 14, the dress fits me with little loose. I love it and it makes me look less fat :D"
4.0,These gloves fit fairly well.  They go on easily and keeping my hands warm wont be an issue in them.  The adjustable strap makes for a nice option in keeping them secure and since I plan on using them for skiing and hiking.
4.0,Fits a little large especially if you don’t have a chest . But all around a great buy and style for the price .
4.0,They look awesome and get the job done but man they're HARD to put on. The padding on the top that goes around the leg/ankle i very soft so as you're putting it in it bents.
4.0,I’m usually a medium had to order a larger and it was still kinda snug. But it all turned out great. I believe I had clothes on underneath because it was raining.
4.0,"Like the feel and fit of the shirts, own a couple of these. One thing I don’t like about this company is takes 7-14 days before they ship through Amazon other than that they sell a good product as advertized"
4.0,"This is a cute dress but was much more casual than I expected it to be.  It's just knit material and doesn't have very much shape to it.  I was hoping for something a little more professional than it turned out to be.  But, it's still cute."
4.0,"I prefer the Sanuk brand.  The material is nice and silky, but the binding they put around it for the toes hurts after I wear them for a while."
4.0,"Overall it is was what I expected. Nice color, fabric.  Love the pockets! It was a little larger than I expected though. I am normally wear a medium in items like this.  Although, a small would have fit better."
4.0,Im 5'4 size medium/large in shirt and have big lower bottoms. I ordered a size Large but could of fit a size Medium for a sexy look.(185 pounds)
4.0,The necklace is very nice but the packaging was Horrible. It arrived in a small bag and the chain was looped in so many knots. Hopefully I can get this out without breaking it because it is attached to the necklace itself
4.0,I read reviews that said to buy larger than your size but when I did that it was too big. Also keep in mind the neck is big for a man's sweater and you can't wear a tshirt under. It looks retarded. If you have a small neck don't buy this sweater.
4.0,The belt is well made and fits perfectly (I am a 33 waist 170lbs).  The only con is that the brown stain does rub off the underside of the belt.
4.0,"As advertised. The one I got had a slight blemish, but is still totally usable..."
4.0,Wish this came in different sizes instead of the one size fits all. It’s very large. I’m 5’2 135 lb and it kind of swallows me. Very pretty though. Material is thin and soft. Love the pattern.
4.0,"They fit well, and hardly slide down at all while wearing them through out the day. Only wish they were just a bit longer. I am 5'9 and they hit about 2in below my knee."
4.0,Perfect quality and slight padding not as cheeky as pictured and the coloring is completely different but still cute
4.0,I really like the key ring! It’s a Christmas present!
4.0,"Not large enough for bust... But everything else a little roomy. But nothing is ever big enough for my chest, so..."
4.0,Fits great but not very flattering around the waist area it hangs
4.0,"I recommend these for larger chested women ONLY if the dress/outfit they are wearing over this bra also has some support in it. This gave me a bit more shape and confidence under a strapless bridesmaid gown, but I wouldn't have felt comfortable wearing under a cotton shirt or a top/dress without some additional support."
4.0,Beautiful and well made.....I am very happy.  Runs true to size.
4.0,Good quality. Have held up a 9 year old great for 5 months so far!! Super comfy. Easy to wipe clean with a babywipe
4.0,Super cute but definitely meant for summer
4.0,"Personally, I only like the praying hands, however I purchased these items to give as a gift, and I haven't heard any complaints."
4.0,This is a great product for the price.
4.0,"Bought this to go with a gray and white animal print raincoat.  One problem: the lace catches--or gets tangled in-- my necklace chain or drop earrings, which is why it got only 4 stars."
4.0,Just plain and classic set. Chain was too short though so I needed to put it on a different chain length not to fit like a choker
4.0,"What a great watch for the price! It truly is an automatic watch! It is beautiful! Great conversation piece as well. The band is a little cheap, and it's a light build overall, but that's exactly what to expect from a 30 dollar watch. My biggest problem is that the fake diamonds on every hour are actually little pieces of glitter. Anyway, very easy to adjust, and is fairly comfortable. When I get a little sweaty, sometimes the inside fogs up a little bit. I still would definitely recommend this watch to anyone.<br /><br />Edit: The watch's back cover came off and it had to be returned. The reason it fogged up was some moisture probably got through to the inside. If you buy this, expect this will happen and seal the cover down with glue. When I returned it they gave me a full refund. Be warned when buying this."
4.0,Well I haven’t caught the corona so it must work great. Much better than a regular face mask. And works great for keeping the face warm out ice fishing as well
4.0,"Trendy, with good fit."
4.0,Elegant and keeps perfect time. I wear it all the time - even while swiMming. There’s only one negative...I want a date on the face.  Outstanding luminous face. Very bright.
4.0,"Despite what everyone is saying about this shirt, I love it!!! It fits as expected. The material looks just like the picture nothing is different. I did get a medium instead of a small because of the look I was going for. I would recommend this product."
4.0,"Really nice skirt. Had to send first one back and order a size up. Not all colors were available in all sizes--but I did order several colors, I liked it so much. However, the black and the navy blue, to my eyes, looked like they were almost the same color--very hard to tell them apart."
4.0,Very soft and well made. Good for my 11 year old daughter. Wouldn't fit anyone much larger.
4.0,She liked it!
4.0,"These quickly have become one of my favorite work pants for summer. The navy coloring is good, the length It’s just for the knee, It has a wide waistband, and are very comfortable. The only reason for four stars is the waist band at times can slightly twist, causing it to be annoying. However these pair well with so many outfits and I enjoy wearing them for work."
4.0,These were the best for a child torture device.  There’s nothing normal or acceptable about masking our children.  But these were the best.  Bye bye masks and child abuse.
4.0,It fit as expected. There was a little puffy on the shoulders that I didn't notice in the pictures but it is still a cute shirt. Good for fall. Overall a good shirt for a good price. Arrived quickly and well packaged.
4.0,I love this top. It fits me amazing. The only problem is I have a hard time finding a bra to wear with it.
4.0,"Bought these for my 2.5 year old who has very sensitive eyes and always needs to wear sunglasses. The style is very cute and the polarized lenses seem to help him, however; they are a little big for him but do stay on his face."
4.0,Love this delicate piece except my wrists are always too small for bracelets so I had to get it kind of resized 😔
4.0,The earrings are perfect just the right size. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I just got them and haven't worn them yet.
4.0,"I love this ring... so pretty. The only problem with it was the black started to come off after about 2 weeks, but I still wear it."
4.0,not as drapey but nice fabric. Size up
4.0,"Great shirt! Only complaint, a bit too thin... you can see my nips through it! It's all good though! I like it when people can see my nips ;)"
4.0,"Light weight, large face making it easier to see numbers and dials"
4.0,"Very soft shirt. Color was as expected. It definitely doesn’t fit like it does on the model. More fitted but true to size. If you want an oversized look, size up two sizes."
4.0,"These shoes run about a half size smaller than the advertised size, but are so soft & flexible. They look super cute on, too. My girls loved them."
4.0,"Looks and works as advertised for the most part, with minor errors in the product listing that are not dealbreakers in my opinion. It did take a long time to arrive (24 days/18 business days), but that was expected. As pictured and described, it provides calendar information for the years 2010-2060. When turning the dial, one can feel minor detents in the rotation mechanism, which means that the calendar is less likely to get turned unintentionally in your pocket. The lettering (shown in the product pictures as red) for January, February, and Sunday is black, just like the rest of the lettering on the calendar, but I did not consider this a major issue. In the pictures, it is difficult to tell the exact color of the calendar, but the item description is correct; it is silver in color due to the zinc/chrome plating. The keyring is as pictured—it's not a chintzy light-duty split ring at all. It measures as a 2.75mm wide by 2.05mm thick split ring, 31.8mm in diameter. The item description lists the diameter of the calendar as &#34;Approx.3.2cm&#34;, but in fact it is actually 4.27cm in diameter. The length is listed as &#34;Approx.7.3cm&#34;; mine measures 7.59cm with the attached keyring. The disk itself is 3.8mm thick, including the central rivet brings it to 4.6mm, and at the calendar's thickest point (the &#34;ball&#34; through which the keyring is inserted), it measures 7.8mm thick. For those wondering how much weight this would add to your keychain, it weighs 26.9g with the keyring, 23.1g without. For those not inclined to carry the calendar on their actual keychain, it wouldn't be too much trouble to cut the keychain ball off with a Dremel and grind it smooth, leaving you with a calendar about the size of a silver dollar. Overall, I'm giving this four out of five stars due to the discrepancies in the item description; if this were corrected, I would give it five stars. I hope that this review was helpful, and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask."
4.0,Fit and quality was fine.
4.0,"Fits a BIT large, but it's pretty heavy material and is a great winter/fall look. The fabric is quite durable of course. The buttons are sewn securely and the sleeves are the right length (seemingly 35-36) for the size. Overall a great look and feel at a great price."
4.0,"I like it and it's cute, but I haven't been able to find much to wear it with. I look forward to wearing it this fall with my favorite long-sleeve maxi.<br /><br />Great stretch, stays hooked, looks nice, should hold up for a very long time."
4.0,"I've gotten lots of compliments on this sweater, the look of it is nice. It's not as soft as I would like, and the pockets seem smaller than what you'd normally have on a sweater like this, but it's not anything that would stand out as a problem in any way. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is the sleeve length. I went up a size because I assumed the sleeves would be short, and they are. Even going up a size they are barely to my wrists. Otherwise I really like this sweater"
4.0,Great shirt for the price.  Fit was perfect.
4.0,"It fits perfect, however the fabric doesn't wash well."
4.0,I wish they were more durable. They fit well over my glasses.
4.0,"Very well made, quality slippers. Have velcro adjustment on top flaps to hold secure. I have a Mild to moderate Bunion/pain, and have been wearing for 1 week . I give this a 4 star rating only because I expected just a bit more arch support; however, the soles are stiff, which took getting used to, but actually help with the ball (Medial joint) from flexing (which cause me pain).<br />Great product, just wish they gave an option for inserts with a tad more arch support."
4.0,Soft & comfy!! Like the stretch & thickness of the material
4.0,Great Love Them...👍🏽
4.0,Looks bigger on the site pics.
4.0,"So I received my hat in &#34;green&#34; today. I purchased the hat in black as well. The green hat is the same as the black. Quality seems decent, fits fine with an adjustable strap on the back and once out of the package and worn the wrinkles from shipment disappeared. I dropped a star because in the photo the hat looks more like a light blue/light turquoise. In person it's an emerald green. The seller does state there is a color variation due to monitors but this is a huge variation. The photo has some filter on it to make the colors pop which has altered the base color of the hat in the photo. The color appears the same on my Chromebook and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus so I know it's not my monitor altering the color. They need to upload an accurate photo for color representation. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase."
4.0,Excellent bag. Very durable.
4.0,Gorgeously flowing fabric.  Lve it for parties.  Did not need to hem when worn with 2-3&#34; wedge shoes and I'm 5'3&#34; - 34D.
4.0,This is a nice top. It fits well. I find that the stripe down the front doesn’t stay nice and centered  though.
4.0,"This skirt is a hair tighter than is ideal, but not inconveniently so. It’s also a tiny bit see-through, I would recamend getting undershorts or wearing it with tights. The design is fun and swishy. All in all, I like it."
4.0,"As for the previous poster, 12M does NOT mean 12 months. If you notice, every size has an M after it. It stands for MEDIUM. As in, normal width. If you couldn't figure that out, you have obviously never bought shoes before. Additionally, I ordered these for my daughter and was very happy with the style, quality and price, but the shipping time was excessive- almost a month. Still, I would order again."
4.0,size matters.  These are really nice but the size was a little tight.
4.0,Size 9-10 large a bit short.
4.0,Products runs a tad on the small size.  I am a size 4 and it fits a little snug around the waist and hips but is complimentary to my figure.  Happy with the purchase.
4.0,Love the color of the bamboo and they are extremely light weight! I haven’t put them down since I got them.
4.0,"Love the new wallet!!!  The only issue I have is that it could use more than one spot for credit cards, license, etc. I received this item at a reduced rate for an honest opinion."
4.0,Nice and very warm and cozy. A little big but still nice
4.0,I normally wear a large but I sized up given the reviews and it’s still a little on the tighter side. I like my shirts to be looser in the summer months given I live in the south but this shirt hugs and doesn’t drape...  all in all I love the shirt for me and my daughter
4.0,beautiful bag! im returning because its a drop smaller than i need. im a teacher and need my looseleaf to fit in there
4.0,Clasp is weak but the bracelet is beautiful.
4.0,"Great scarf. Pretty colors. Light weight. Goes with everything.  I can see it snagging at some point, but what do you expect for this low price?"
4.0,Definitely a 'blanket' scarf!  The item is HUGE and I have found myself using it more as a blanket or shawl than an actual scarf.  Even attempting different wraps it just ends up looking way too bulky to wear as a scarf.  I will say that the colors are very vibrant and stylish and the material is super soft!
4.0,My grandson likes the shoes and no problems with the lights or fit. Four stars because he says they're not as comfortable as his Skechers. The light button is not placed in a very good position. It's on the inside ankle and it causes discomfort after awhile.
4.0,Feet part is a Lil long ....but am able to work with it
4.0,I had to return this item it was too small. But I did love the colors in it. Sad to find out they didn’t have anymore.
4.0,"Purchased as gift, recipient loved it.  Too soon to know about shrinkage or wear. Delivered very quickly, Thank you!"
4.0,"So I love the look of these and they were very snug when I pulled them on, but I did a few slow squats and lunges to stretch them out a bit and they got better. I wore them for about an hour to give them a go and by the end of the hour the button had torn out. I hate the return process so I’m just going to try and fix them by installing a higher quality button. But probably order a size up if you’re on the curvier side.<br /><br />I’m an athletic size L btw"
4.0,I had to abb more  Material to stretch the back a little to fit me right but overall I love it and happy with dress...
4.0,"Boots are great and very warm, 1 small problem is putting them on, the liner tens to fall in. You need to hold the back of the liner as you put your foot in."
4.0,"The prints were great, a little hard to get on. But overall a great product"
4.0,I have Leiden factor and my internist told me that I’d have to take Coumadin for the rest of my life because I’ve had DVTs in both of my legs. I am thinking that maybe these will prevent DVT’s . I will I wear them now all the time…<br />I’ve stopped the Coumadin and I am simply trusting these to keep me from getting DVT’s.
4.0,"Arrived much quicker than expected and my little daughter loved them. Quality is good for the price although one of the snaps broke within 5min. Still,  a good buy at a great price...."
4.0,I like the purse but the button wasn't secured very well and I lost it.  I need to find something else to fit or cut off the latch.
4.0,"This is very pretty and different. I love the way it fastens. It’s like an S. So the end slides onto it. Makes it so much easier when you are doing it yourself. However, the other day I got up and the end had slipped off. But all in all, this may be my fault because I was sleeping with the necklace on. I’m bad. I didn’t have any trouble with it during the day wearing it. The chain is a pretty white. It’s all so gorgeous"
4.0,I ordered a Large and a size small was sent. I am returning the dress and reordered a Large.<br />The dress is stunning and well made. I hope the correct size comes before my scheduled event
4.0,"Bought it for my wife, she loves it!!!"
4.0,Purchased for my 10yo son. Fits well & he loves it. Comfortable and stays in place without constant touching/fiddling. Easy to handwash at home. Dries fairly quickly (next day despite humid weather) laid flat.<br />As an alternative for a cloth or paper mask equally effective and he is more cooperative in using it. Thats all I was looking for out of it.. Does NOT have filter and will not replace a higher level mask such as n95.
4.0,"Hmm. This shirt was pretty cute. Fit well and was flattering with the ruching. I liked the top arm holes but the bottom ones fit almost directly over my elbows so that my elbows popped through the holes unless I twisted the sleeves sideways a bit. I think that might irritate me too much, so I may have to return. Fabric and fit are nice. I'm wearing a medium and it is snug on the bust and fits well elsewhere. I'm about 140 lbs, US size 10, 30FF UK bra size."
4.0,"Nice affordable jacket, but choose a size smaller than you normally would"
4.0,I like the color and the style of the overalls. The material is great for the summer and I love that it has two pockets. The buttons to connect the straps are cute. However it’s a little snugged in the crotch area
4.0,"Super cute shirt that only fans of the show will understand/find humor in, however, I was surprised by how big this shirt was. I ordered a Small and I am a size 4, 34D, and it is a little oversized on the shoulders and was long enough to cover most of my butt. Not necessarily a bad thing, as I can still wear it to sleep or to the gym, but it is certainly not a fitted shirt if that's what you're looking for."
4.0,It's see through
4.0,It is a beautiful sentimental piece.  But the writing is almost not readable.  Quality however is perfect for what it is.
4.0,"Nice bracelet, although it couldve been painted a little neater. It ended up doing the trick either way."
4.0,Jewelery for the price
4.0,Fits a little bigger then I would like. I'm usually a street size 14 and they kept falling down.
4.0,"Just purchased. So far happy. Enough room for my daily stuff. Can fit a 10 in tablet (see pic) Use this as a work bag or for security purposes I need a clear purse. Good size, side compartment for phone, glasses.<br /><br />There was a strong plastic smell when I first opened it, so an airing out period may be required."
4.0,"Description says cotton, but nowhere on packaging or on the product does it say that. I question the content, because they don't really seem like cotton socks. They are also a tad small. I wear a women's size 8 shoe, and I have to pull them up strongly to be able to see the whole face above my sneakers. Other than that, they are adorable, and I've gotten lots of compliments when I lift up my pant leg and show off my piggies or teddy bears! haha."
4.0,"I really like this dress - It fits as expected, but I have one problem - the hem was not billed or pictured to be a &#34;high-low&#34; hem, but that's what mine is - The front is about a foot (that's 12 INCHES) shorter in the middle than at the back and sides.  I'm going to keep it, but wanted others to know."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress that could easily be dressed up or down with accessories.  The vintage green pattern is stunning, and I love the pockets!  It's not formal, but it would work in any business-smart office setting.  Definitely for women with a short-average torso length, and needs to be sized up if large chest and/or broad shoulders.  Given the material, a lot of stretch would not look good.  For reference:  I'm 5'8"", size 12, 36DD bust and 30 inch waist, and the XL fit.  Unfortunately the bodice is about 3 inches too short on me, so I look like a muffin below my ribs.  No good.  This brand does make a V-neck version of this dress, which looks great...just a heads-up for anybody with a similar body type."
4.0,Me encantaron! Perfectas para mis manualidades
4.0,"I do like these gloves. They aren't bulky, fit nicely, soft, and I can use my smart phone with them on. I still feel the wind going into my gloves, probably where the seam attaches. They keep my hands somewhat warm. I got medium and they fit well. Usually I wear medium or large depending on the glove. I don't recommend these for riding a motorcycles though. At 58 degrees outside, I felt the wind pierce through and my hands were cold. I'll have to find another option for riding."
4.0,should have ordered a smaller size but great look
4.0,"I bought this for my wife, and these are her thoughts.<br /><br />“It fits very well to my small frame.” (4’10”, 105lbs). She says it breathes very well and keeps her back cool. The water capacity is sufficient and the weight it well-balanced. She likes all of the pockets for her Gu and other energy stuff.<br /><br />She says she wishes the magnet that holds the tube to her chest was a bit stronger.<br /><br />Overall, she’s happy with this and will use it in her upcoming Spartan Beast."
4.0,Pretty good belt for the price
4.0,"A great piece for any Whovian,  I only wish it were made of metal instead of plastic.  Still, a great collectable."
4.0,It definitely sheds but I still love it
4.0,Thinner fabric than expected but still like it especially for hot occasions. Wish it was longer but the description is accurate so use that instead of pictures.
4.0,"Great support, great quality, great true fit.  The only issue I have with this bra is that it is a bit low on the underarm, offering me a little less support and coverage than I would prefer but that may be just to do with my specific biology - who knows. It fits exactly as in the photo which does show a little low cut under the arm compared to some other sports bras.  Other than that, this bra is true to size (34D fit exactly like a snug, well made, new 34D bra), fits so comfortably, holds everything in place with no bounce whatsoever.  I've gotten back pain from other criss cross back straps but not this one.  I've washed it three times already and it looks like new.  I highly recommend this sports bra.  You really can't beat it for the price."
4.0,If tou wear hugh quality glasses like revo or raybans it will feel cheap. Quality is something you'd pick up in stores like 711 but comes with case and cleaning cloth. Good for driving.
4.0,soft and comfortable. the neckline is a little high.
4.0,"It's a nice, simple black band that stretches and is breathable.  The clasp can be difficult to open and close while you're adjusting the band to fit your wrist.  Once you get the size figured out, the clasp isn't an issue because the band will stretch to slip over your hand."
4.0,"they sit high on the nose, great lens and sun blocks morning glare"
4.0,daughter loves them.  good quality!
4.0,"Totally obsessed with this dress! It’s not the thickest fabric but for how it looks & how comfy it is, it’s still a great dress. Turns heads for sure! Fits snug. Size up. For reference I’m in a large and usually wear 6/8."
4.0,Pin backings come off too easily.
4.0,"Nice shirt, but expected 2x to be larger."
4.0,So far this bag has been great for school..perfect size for most mid size binders and textbooks
4.0,Just didn’t like that they came with the clear rubber back part
4.0,I love this jump suit looks just like the picture
4.0,"The horseshoe with the balls on the end is genuinely my all-time favourite septum ring. Most of my septums were way too large for me and chunky, this one is perfectly small and subtle, I get a lot of compliments for it. What I also really like is that i have had it in my nose for about 4 months and it still looks brand new. I have also had septum rings from professional body modification websites that actually lost its gold colour after a while and the part that was connected to my skin went silver, causing infections. Meanwhile, I got this one for way cheaper and it still looks gorgeous!<br /><br />The star off is because i don't really like the other four. The design on the clickers, as well as the opals and diamond replicas, look really cheap. Additionally, the clicker part isn't too high end."
4.0,Excellent for the shooting range. A great bargain.
4.0,"Great stretch on these tops, but they are sized to be fitted"
4.0,I little big but it's OK
4.0,Great Seller & Product
4.0,Unique yet classy tie bar. Decent quality. Would buy another
4.0,There super comfy and soft. Great buy
4.0,I am very happy with my purchase. The coat  fits will and is very warm.
4.0,"I actually bought these for MX purposes because it's harder to find goggles that also cover the nose under a full face helmet these days at a reasonable price. I don't mind the tint, but the foam could be more comfortable- it's not bad at all, but there are some really comfy ones out there- I'm just tired of taking shots to the nose, so these are working just fine."
4.0,"I'm guessing this dye was manufactured sometime in the 1960's. The carton was badly stained and the bottle was about 3/4 full. However, this being said, I was satisfied with the product. There was plenty of dye to cover two old cream color walking shoes a nice color, (although a bit blotchy) of brown. If you are looking to make an old pair of shoes look brand new, good luck, but if you want to make an old ugly pair that you are ashamed to wear out to cut the grass, look good enough to be seen in public in, this is a very good purchase. And, I still have enough left over to apply a third coat."
4.0,Fits great however I did think they would be an inch or two longer.
4.0,Could always do with more gold for the price but it was very satisfying to pan.
4.0,good price not very durable but stylish
4.0,Very practical!
4.0,"Pretty nice guitar strap for the price. My 14 year old son has not complained about it, and that's saying something."
4.0,Nice bag even though the inside zipper split the first day and I had to find my items in the liner. Other than that the bag is actually nice. I guess the inside is thin and splits easy.
4.0,Helped with night vision glare problems
4.0,"These earrings are cute and exactly what I was looking for.  My only complaint is that they are really long.  I believe they gave the length in the description, I just didn't measure how far down they would hang."
4.0,"Overall it’s a cute sports bra and provides pretty good support. It is a little tight though. For reference, I’m 5’4, 126 lbs and a 34D. I ordered a medium and it is very snug across my chest; I probably could’ve gone with a large."
4.0,They're comfortable. All good
4.0,I really like this watch because I don't have to put my glasses on every time I want to know what time it is!
4.0,"Its not the best quality, but fits perfect. Took way longer than the standard shipping. Ordered the matching necklace only to be later refunded cause it wasn't available, after it said it was."
4.0,"Not the best quality, but I was looking for at home bike shorts. They have an interesting texture, but they work. I don’t feel like I can see through them, but I wouldn’t wear them in public unless under a SUPER long shirt or a dress. They are lightweight enough to not make you too hot under a dress too."
4.0,Love them! Just wish they were a tad bit looser.
4.0,"The mask is made with quality materials.  I love the colors.  I haven't actually worn it to a party yet, but it seems sturdy.  What I don't like is how close it fits to my face.  I am a small person and it fits too snugly around my eyes.  I can feel my lashes against it.  I am going to look for foam strips to attach to it to hold it out a little from my face."
4.0,"I bought the sweatshirt in blue.  The color is beautiful, and fit me perfectly. However I am a little disappointed that it is too thin for a sweatshirt"
4.0,"I wear a size 10-12 on top and could have worn the medium if I wanted a bit more snug, form hugging tank top. I am equally happy with the slightly loser large though. It's made well, soft cotton fabric, and best is long enough to cover my tushy. I am 5'3&#34;. I would purchase this again."
4.0,Really liked the skirt but I have such an odd proportioned body that with a small it fits in my hips but doesn’t fit around my wais so I have to wear a belt with it in order for it to fit right. But for the price I can’t complain at all!
4.0,Looks cute but Super Small!!! Not even close to being the correct size ...
4.0,"Fits pretty well for my size; however, the torso area seems a bit short--could have been made longer."
4.0,"Ok I know this dress is a FreePeople knock-off, but I ordered it anyways and I love it! It seemed to be that the dress was a hit-or-miss in terms of it being floor length or above the ankle, mine was above the ankle, as you can see in the photos, but I still really love this dress!<br /><br />Fabric is a little cheap and feels like it has a possibility of wear over time, so I'd suggest gentle washing and no drying. It's definitely not as quality made as FreePeople but for the price I think it's totally worth it! Love this dress."
4.0,"I'm a small woman that needs tiny temple bars, so I always get kids sunglasses, and I've gotten previous pairs from Dicks Sporting Goods because they're the only kids sunglasses I could ever find that were polarized. These are only a teeny bit too small-framed for my face, but the temple bars are perfect. The ONLY gripe I have about these is that, if I slide them up on top of my head and lean over slightly, they don't stay on top of my head, but that's not a big gripe, and I know that it's because these are very flexible on purpose so that kids don't break them immediately. For the price it's a good deal, and if I decide I don't like them, I can give them to my son :)"
4.0,good purchase.  fit well and these are comfortable.
4.0,"My little one loved this dress, she never wants to take it off! She's an average size three year old and the dress fits perfectly - just as expected. It seems to be the perfect material (a little thick) and color for the Fall or Winter. It would go nicely with a long sleeve shirt and leggings or tights."
4.0,"Fits good, I thought the material was going to be light weight and cheap feeling but it's great."
4.0,"My daughter loves this bag and so do her friends. The color is very eye catching. It's big enough to put in a 750ml water bottles, shoes and some clothes. Only problem is, it gets dirty quite easily."
4.0,The cuteness factor overtakes the fact that the material of the shirt does not have that aged look and the print looks like it was done at home and ironed on.
4.0,These pieces are very sof and stretchy and so fit well.  They are comfortable and cute. Reasonably priced.
4.0,Comfortable. Fix as expected. Soft. Good purchase
4.0,"I thought this dress was going to be quite a bit longer than it is. I'm only 5'2&#34; and it hits me a bit above the knees. Other than the length it's really pretty. I thought it might be a wear to work type dress but it is really shiny and is beautiful for a good cocktail party, etc."
4.0,"The gloves were a hit with my grandson since he needed this type, but I would not expect them to last long. The stitching is loose and some ends were unravelling when we got them, but for the price, good enough to last the season."
4.0,"The dress does run small, however after reading the reviews I sized up.  The fabric is care free and stretchy.  I brought this dress for the Opera.  I'm sure I'll have a good time wearing it.  I'm about 5'5&#34; and pleasingly plump with curves and busty.  I tried on with  a four inch heel shoe and the dress falls beautifully."
4.0,"Just what I looking for sun protection. It’s lightweight for a wide brim, comfortable to wear and stitch together beautifully. Can’t go wrong...would highly recommend and comes in different pretty colors."
4.0,I love this product the material is stretchy yet firm. Fits great everywhere except in the under arms. It is a bit snug and hard to put on. It is worth the struggle because I am comfortable all day.
4.0,"The only complaint I have is not with the product itself.  I love this cardigan and have gotten many compliments on it.  I read all the reviews saying that these run small so I should order a size up.  So, I ordered a large instead of a medium and it is actually a little too big on me now.  I wish I would have stuck to the size I would have ordered had I not read the reviews"
4.0,"I ordered an XL in blue and it fit/looked great! Since I weigh about 185 lbs and cup size 36H, and the back is out (hence you can't wear a bra), I had to wear a support garment underneath (see pics) and it still looked great. I received a lot of compliments. Just beware that the material is really thin but with summer months ahead, I'm glad I bought it."
4.0,"This map is really cool. You just tap it, and then it is like you are in the world of Harry Potter. It was smaller than I expected, but still really good."
4.0,"Mine was bought from Amazon vendor Dexclusive and is the orange and black dial version.<br /><br />Description Correction.  The width between strap lugs is 28mm rather than the listed 25mm so if you want a steel band version order it that way as per Diesel in the USA the metal bands are not available separately and a web search does not show 28mm wide metal watch bracelets as available from any other sources.<br /><br />Mine arrived with a dead battery installed for the smallest analog dial watch movement.  Before returning the watch as defective I had the battery replaced to determine if it was a battery or movement problem.  It turned out to be the battery fortunately.  I have no idea how long the watch was in stock or if the battery was actually defective or itself old stock.<br /><br />With the included band the weight is a relatively reasonable 144 grams or about 5 ounces.  I have several considerably heavier watches with steel bracelet bands.<br /><br />Having had the watch open for battery replacemen I can say that it uses four separate quartz movements, each with its own separate battery."
4.0,A little big but so cute! I bought the size 5 for my daughter who is 16 months. She has an average sized foot and will be able to wear them in a couple months. It will be worth the wait because they are just so cute!
4.0,It seems to be a more soft leather than really is in the advertisement.
4.0,Loved the fit and comfortable fit.
4.0,"Decent quality, fits slightly small. Overall better than expected but it looks slightly different than the Amazon pictures."
4.0,"Nice full figure fit. Arms a bit snug, but fabric is very flexible. Color is not as brilliant as pictured, but just right for a casual look."
4.0,I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"I thought it just custom type shirt, this is real shirt, it is too fancy for the price, the square buttons need little patient to button up, and hope don't lose them. sim fit very well!"
4.0,Seems small for a med
4.0,"An in denial plus size woman who is not willing to buy fat clothes, but still needs to look good, this dress is a great solution. Pockets!!! nice medium weight fabric. Only thing: there is no matching of the print to the design, and it is not symmetrical."
4.0,These boots are cute but I would recommend that you size down. I wear a 7 and 6.5 is almost too big.
4.0,My son loved it! It made his day!
4.0,"As Raymond Babbit said, &#34;it's very shiny&#34;!!!......Nice workmanship, sturdy clasp.  Glad I purchased it."
4.0,Nice but one arrived with scratches
4.0,"Needed a better pair of gloves than my store-bought old leather ones; was freezing my fingers shoveling snow in cold temps.  Ordered these, definitely warmer than my old ones, though sub-zero temps will still creep in, that's probably inevitable.  However, if you need to do anything requiring dexterity with your fingers, these probably aren't right for you.  They're somewhat bulky and it's difficult to maneuver your fingers while wearing; they're too clumsy to even fasten my face mask behind my ears.  Good for holding a snow shovel, though!"
4.0,It fit very well and held up good after washing it...
4.0,"It's a cool hat, fits a little big but much better then to small."
4.0,EASY TO USE
4.0,"My foot is wide across the toe with bunion and high arch, so can be difficult to find a good fit.  I am between size 8.5 - 9 or European 39.5 - 40.  The sandals were cute, seemed well made, comfortable, but short for a size 9.  I measured to my Teva Tirra sandal size 8.5, and they were definitely overall smaller.  I am sending back, but think that I will try a size 10, which on the chart says it's a size 40."
4.0,"Loved it , but I ordered a small and It ran big. I am 5 1 and 110 lbs. I had to return. I was disappointed"
4.0,"Yes, I first bought them for myself. When I would go into this office to do paperwork, I would take my masks off and forget where I had put it. It is awesome!! Problem solved and they are always around my neck!! They are really nice and I get a lot of compliments. So yes I had to order some for my friends who loved them also. My only complaint was it says ten pack and I received five."
4.0,Socks are great.  Feel soft and easily fits with all types of shoes.
4.0,"My sons gf had a 60s theme birthday party and needed a costume last minute. Colors were more ""minty"" than fluorescent. I would say more of pastel based. Vrry thin material but since it is a costume that is expected. We were pleased overall just expected bright bold colors or fluorescents not pastels. He wore the shirt/vest but wore brown pants with it because he didn't like the mint green."
4.0,Its absolutely beautiful! It wasn't long enough. This is the only problem we encountered. I would have sent it back but my grand daughter tore the tag off of it.
4.0,I wish I'd gotten the next size up. But overall these are comfy and stay on in moving water.
4.0,"I normally wear an L/XL (us) size. The XL for this top was teeny tiny and TIGHT. I knew the next size up wouldn’t be enough so I went for the 3xl (a size I NEVER consider).... and it fits, but still a bit more snug than I prefer. I do have a larger chest, and that part was the most snug on my body. I like it but I’m afraid of ripping the seams. (For reference, I am a 38-40D). I love the pattern and like that it is 100% cotton. I’ll probably keep it and just be gentle wearing it.<br /><br />Order at least 2 sizes up. If you’re busty like me, that might not be enough though."
4.0,Shiny and look expensive
4.0,Too small for a adult man's feet without stretching and distorting the image severely. The picture quality is quite nice even after being washed.
4.0,"Only problem I had was that the buttons weren't sewn on very well so I had to re-sew them. Also, in the picture, the sleeves look black. In person however, they're actually a dark blue. I like to use it for performing at my concerts and I love it!"
4.0,Great shirt for a good price. Fit as expected. Very happy with product.
4.0,"The earrings are pretty and lightweight which I like. I thought from the picture they would be round like a ball but they are a flattened ball so still have that dimension, just not what I expected. Decided to keep them."
4.0,These are some of the most comfortable panties I have ever worn!
4.0,Good too go
4.0,Love it and it looks great. Thank you
4.0,Nice cute wedge
4.0,"The picture of these Blue Light Blocking Glasses makes them look like the lenses are tinted a dark gray. They’re not. The glasses that I received were a slight yellow – the color of blue light blocking glasses.<br /><br />However, even though these glasses don’t match the listing, they’re really good for blue light blocking. If you weren’t looking for sunglasses that also blocked blue light, you’ll be quite happy with these.<br /><br />I’ve deducted one star from these five star glasses because the actual product didn’t match the listing."
4.0,"A little thinner than I thought, but won't rip asap or anything. It's very tight on me which I love but I have a 25.5' waist so this would not be good for anyone larger than a 2 or small 4. (the elastic is very thick and hard to stretch so it would cause some pain)."
4.0,only 1 per order
4.0,Totally cool band with a great fit on my 7 3/4 wrist
4.0,"It's cute but I think the royal blue with white lettering looks better. Also, don't be shocked if you see a Daily Bread pamphlet with your order. I was a tad bit annoyed but then I realized that they send it to everyone and may not factor in that everyone that orders isn't Christian."
4.0,We just received this item as a gift for our daughter who loves The Flash. Upon opening it the first thing we noticed is that it comes in a very cheap case. The case is almost like one of those plastic holders that you get out of quarter machines. So the case it comes in is very very very cheap. With that being said the Ring itself looks good and appears to be very sturdy. It has a nice shine to it straight out of the wrapper but it is new. Appears to be a step up from custom jewelry but for $13 what would you expect. Once my daughter has it and she wears it for a while I will give some more feedback. I will recommend NOT TO USE hand sanitizer while wearing the ring due to that fact it will tarnish it. So be sure to take it off if you use hand sanitizer. I would also recommend that if you are giving this as a gift do not use the box it came in... It is just really cheap. If the seller is viewing this review I would love to see this come in at least a cardboard box. Walmart even puts their $5 rings in a cardboard box. So 4 stars at this point and could be 5 stars with a better presentation (ring box). Like stated before I will give another review once the ring has been worn.
4.0,"These are adorable, but like other reviewers said, they are cut a bit funny. I got an XXL bc I was paranoid about the Chinese sizes, but XXL was gigantic. I am 5'6&#34; and 160 pounds, and I wear a medium or large in pants and a medium or large in shirts. Don't really know what my numeric pants size is bc I avoid those like the plague. I'm all about pull on jeans and pants, which these are not but I do pull these on and off bc they're still big enough to do that with. Anyhoo, the issue I have is that I can't go down another size because the legs really are cut very skinny, and the jeans don't have stretch to them. If I went down to the L, the waist and hip area would fit better, but I bet I wouldn't be able to get my legs in. That's okay, though, bc I'm probably going to gain weight after my summer break!"
4.0,It fits but if you want it slouchy like the picture order at least 1 size up.
4.0,"I like this shirt. It flows well and hides my problem areas and looks nice. It does have a flower that bothers me that is placed a little awkward on the bust area near the armpit, that looks like a little bleach stain instead of a flower, but my long hair covers it most of the time so I’m going to keep it."
4.0,Item nice but too big.  could not keep on my shoulders.
4.0,"I'm 5'6"" and 225 lbs. The XL fir perfectly. Quality is ok."
4.0,"Fits as expected, feels great!"
4.0,"Really nice material, thick and warm, but not for me. I'm 5'3 and 125lbs and this made me look like a 5-year-old playing dress up. Not sure why but even my husband hated it on me."
4.0,Too big on my face. Will be giving them to my daughter. Would be 5 star if they were smaller
4.0,"Fits great, but some of the material has shimmery marks on it."
4.0,"Very soft. Washed well. My daughter loves how twirly it is. It’s a little short, not small."
4.0,"Nice glasses but you still get a yellowish tint from other cars windshields and headlights that are disturbing until you adjust. I put stick on bifocals on them and they work great. Very stylish and lightweight and nice case too,."
4.0,But a nice gift to give!!
4.0,"Read size chart carefully, runs small! Was easy to cinch up by another, definitely a 2 person job."
4.0,Am very pleased with this product!
4.0,Good handle.
4.0,"perfect cover up, great price and very comfortable"
4.0,"Really nice, good for the price"
4.0,I love the bag but I went to put the shoulder strap on the bag and it broke. Looking at the piece it looks corroded and is just crumbling.
4.0,Our average size baby outgrew the socks by 3.5 months. Otherwise great.
4.0,WARM AND COMFY
4.0,"It feels good. Nice material. The logo and words look great. The only things i did not like were that it felt kind of thin. However it will still work to keep you warm. Also, i wish it was a little bigger. Its the perfect size for a kid or to lay across your lower body, but it would be difficult to stretch it across you entire body if you are a full grown adult. Despite that, its still a good blanket."
4.0,My glasses fog up when i wear this up to my nose :( Other than that it's pretty badass
4.0,"Lovely purse, bit stiff though."
4.0,Fit as expected.  Bought these because of varicose veins in calves.  Seem to provide good compression - not crazy about having to wear them but my doctor recommended to wear them when I workout.
4.0,Beautiful but it doesn't fit
4.0,Very lightweight and cool
4.0,"Ordered two sizes larger as recommended, but was much too large through this shoulders and bust. Ordered a smaller size and it fits better, although the shoulders are still a bit broad. At 5'10"" it is a couple of inches shorter than I would like but is still wearable. Suitable for a formal wedding."
4.0,"Perfect for looks or holiday dress up, definitely not thick enough for running or exercise! Size a bit small and pretty thin but perfect for the holiday cheer"
4.0,"The only thing I don't like about these boots is how the toe looks. Very round and a little goofy. BUT...I have done everything to include a 3 mile run in them, not by choice, and the didn't hurt my feet at all. as a matter of fact they felt like extreme high top tenis shoes."
4.0,"Fit well. I like my fitted shirts a little loose and got my normal size, so this was perfect! Good quality!"
4.0,Wore this to an Avengers Infinity War screening. :D<br /><br />Looks awesome and fit as expected. The only nitpick I have is because of 100% cotton material it attracts lint like crazy after drying.
4.0,Excellent tie and is what I expected
4.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes the look of it! His style is pretty classic and conservative, as he works in an office, and he thought this was a great versatile piece. As other reviews mention, it is a little difficult to put on and remove, but after some practice he got the hang of it and now can switch the bands with minimal trouble."
4.0,"I love these headbands, but they are not for infants. My daughter is 2 mos and won't be able to wear these for some time."
4.0,They look good on.
4.0,"This watch is lovely.the face is easy to read. The circle of crystals makes it look special. The mesh bracelet has an easy to use clasp and can be adjusted to fit a range of wrist sizes, including plus. It comes in a nice black box. No directions were included. It makes since to print the product page which includes instructions for setting the time and adjusting the bracelet. Very pretty and looks more expensive than it is."
4.0,A cute dress but it was super long on me. I'm 5'0 and went past my knee caps. The length was to my calfs. The material was soft.
4.0,Though a smidge short they stay on my feet really well even without socks. Very warm and great traction.
4.0,"I like it, but after wearing it for a while and taking it out to places, the shades get all scratched up. Because it's supposed to be mirrored shades, the scratches are noticeable and distracting.<br />When the shades are fresh/new they're nice though. Nice style, nice color."
4.0,"I am a complete scarf hoarder. I believe a nice scarf can completely dress up an outfit and make it look more stylish. I also live in New England and half the year you need a nice scarf so your neck doesn't freeze or get eaten by mosquito's and no see um bugs!<br /><br />I purchased this pashmina scarf because it has many of the colors that I wear every day in it. It looked very beautiful and I felt it would be a perfect scarf to take on vacation because it has so many options.<br /><br />The second time I wore the scarf I had a disaster with a jar of minced garlic. I immediately put the scarf into the washing machine on the gentle cycle by itself.<br /><br />After washing the scarf came out with a tighter knit and it had some pills and loose threads. It's not noticeable from far away but you can see it up close and it does make the scarf look well loved. I wish it had washed up nicer and still looked brand new. I was happy none of the colors faded at all.<br /><br />I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $2 for my honest and unbiased review. This does not mean, however, that I will automatically rate this as 4 or 5 stars. Each rating I give for each product I receive is always 100% honest and based solely on my own use and experiences with them. Based on my history of reviews you will see that I am not afraid to rate a product as &#34;poor&#34; based on a bad performance, bad quality, or even not performing as expected. Thank you!"
4.0,This is a great quality coat. Exactly what I was looking for at a good price. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the elastic at the bottom is a little too loose and I wanted it tighter to prevent cold air from coming in. Otherwise excellent coat!
4.0,"Very nice Shades! Serves as my primary driving sunglasses and I have driven from New York to Michigan (10-12hr+ drive) often forgetting that I even had these on! That statement alone says a lot.  So why the loss of one star you might be wondering? well that's b/c the pictures show this product like some metallic shiny super sleek design and it's not.  It's plastic, flexible and very good quality, but not metallic in any shape or form.  The gray color looks rather dull (maybe more gunmetal? there is some shine to it) but really, in regards to quality and functionality it gets 5 stars from me.  It is a little tight and best suited for a person with a smaller narrow face and sometimes but I think overtime it has adapted to my face.  If these break I will instantly come back to purchase another pair.  Wish they were available in other colors!"
4.0,Runs a little bit large.  Otherwise It will work.  Just as described.
4.0,They are very nice rings but run small. I ordered them for my husband and once they came in fit my ring size. I'll be ordering him another set in a much bigger size. to look on the bring size i got my self a nice set of work out rings.
4.0,"Got this swimsuit for my daughter. Fits just right and she loves it. Says it’s comfortable, and it looks good on."
4.0,Perfect watch for hands on jobs. Slim design and only 10 dollors. The light in this watch is not good I'm pretty sure all casios are known for bad lighting over for $10 its solid
4.0,"Apparently my subconscious really liked these b/c I found out later that my bestie has the same pair and she had been wearing them a year ago when I visited her. Anyway - love the design and have gotten many complements on it. They're a bit loose when you put them up on your forehead, so they've definitely dropped when I tilted my head back/forward before. My friend's pair has gotten really loose over the year, but I guess that's to be expected of a pair of glasses that are this cheap. The polarization is only so-so; leaves much to be desired, but it still helps a bit."
4.0,My dad absolutely loves these! He said the only problem he has with them is that they overheat easily due to the fake wool material trapping body heat in.
4.0,"These soft pants are surprisingly well made. I have a medium sized pair in solid black that I've worn for years without them looking the way rayon usually does after too many washings. In general, I recommend these pants at a 5-star level.<br /><br />However, these pants do run a little large, so I thought I'd try the small size instead, in a different pattern. The waist and hips were one size down, as expected, and fit great, but the legs were about 6&#34; shorter than they seem in the photo. And I have short legs for my height, so that's not the reason.<br /><br />I don't know why, but it seems (at least for the black chevron pattern I got) that the pattern was overly cut down on leg length when designed in the smaller size.<br /><br />Fortunately there was no difficulty in returning without charge for a full refund, so as long as you can get the free refund option, I'd recommend trying them rather than thinking it's not worth the risk."
4.0,Very cute! Looks just as pictured and quality is nice for the price you pay!
4.0,My husband loved his shirt and it came in a timely fashion. Wish the cotton had been a tad bit softer but nice shirt overall!
4.0,"I wasn't expecting them to be so sparkly.  I was hoping for grey, but sparkles are ok for me, too.  Slightly tight for 7, but not overwhelmingly so."
4.0,"Purchased this as a gift.  It arrived beautifully boxed with an inner fabric sleeve for safe keeping,"
4.0,"Really cute, nice quality. Read the reviews and ordered a size up which ended up being fine."
4.0,"love them and my daughter loves them, but the bows come off easy."
4.0,"For not being polarized, I would like them to be cheaper."
4.0,Es igual a la descripción y la talla es correcta
4.0,"I needed knee length shorts to wear under dresses and these are perfect! The fabric is thick enough that I might actually wear them as regular shorts too. I am 5'2'' 160 lbs and the large is just slightly on the tight side in the rear but otherwise a good, comfortable fit. I like the high waist and it offers a little bit of tummy control for my bulky belly. A note for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of LDS: these DO offer the coverage you are looking for! I'm very happy!"
4.0,"This ring functions properly and is decent looking, but when it arrived it was much larger than I was expecting. It tells you this, but really keep in mind that the length listed is not the diameter of the ring but the length of the bar in the middle. This ring hangs low. I was looking for something slightly more understated, but no worries. I'll still be wearing it. I would recommend this to someone who wants something more flashy."
4.0,"I really loved how vibrant the colors are in this shirt. The material is soft, a little stretchy, but thin. I wish it were a bit thicker or sturdy. (I wonder how it will do in the wash.)<br />The zipper is in the middle of the back. There is no stopper at the top, so be careful when pulling the slider. The zipper is invisible, so the slider is thin. This is usually not a big deal, but the zipper is in the middle of the back. If you are not flexible, you will need help closing and opening the shirt.<br />I plan to re-order the shirt in a larger size. I am too excited to wear this shirt."
4.0,Nice. Good for the price
4.0,Comfortable and well fitted
4.0,glasses just as listed.  1 case didn't fit but wear so no big deal
4.0,As promised.  Gets noticed when wear watch
4.0,"I have been using Fieblings neatsfoot oil for years on my tack and leather boots. Its unfortunately becoming difficult to come by in stores. Anyways, it softens up my saddle and bridle extremely well! My boots, on the other hand, it doesn't seem to hydrate nearly as much, so I need to out an additional product like Skidmores on top of it. I wonder if its just because they are exposed to more dirt, sun, and water than my tack, or if maybe the leather just isn't as high of quality to begin with. Regardless, this is a great product that I've been using for years!"
4.0,"I waited until I broke em' in to write a review. These are by far the best workboots I've ever purchased. I wear them six days a week. Very comfortable, extremely rugged."
4.0,"I received these in no time flat, they look great! However after a week of having it, my keys are left in my car 80% of the time, the seams began to come undone. So I switched out to another. It did the same thing. Theres enough I can just switch out but not the point. Maybe a better stitch so they hold up, otherwise they get the job done!"
4.0,"This hat is stylish while providing me with the sun protection I need. Our office recently moved buildings with offsite parking that is about  15 minutes walk. I noticed my sunspots getting worse so I started wearing hat. However despite my wife brim hats , i noticed no improvement with my sunspots. A friend suggested getting a UV protection hat. I found this hat the better of the 2 I Iordered from Amazon. Although my main reason for wearing this hat is to protect my face from the sun, I like that it is stylish . The only reason I did not give it a 5 star- it is collapsible but after about a month it started losing its shape . I had to use an iron to put back the brim in its original shape."
4.0,"Cute and comfy, super warm! Wish the bottoms were waterproof though!"
4.0,Jewel fittings feel loose but nothing’s fallen out yet!
4.0,This was a Precious Necklace bought for my Granddaughter. It's pretty Small but also just what she wanted ! All in all a Good Buy !!
4.0,"It was worth being the first to buy this or at least the first to review it . I'm huge on reading reviews with clothes. I LOVE this.  My only complaint is the shoulders are loose. They can't decide if they want to be up or down.  They look better up though. I'm 5'4 , 200lbs, 34C. Dress falls 2 inch above my knees .The large fit fine , wiggle room for tummy.  Looks/ fits better without a bra ."
4.0,These shoes are comfortable and come with inserts that would have been nice to have but make them way to tight when inserted
4.0,Love the shirt unfortunately the green shirt which is a gift for my daughter came with a spot on it. May be exchanging for a new one.
4.0,"Very pretty. Haven't used yet, but like the pin concept vs the pull through concept. I ordered several scarf pins that were too small to pull a thick scarf through. This will work nicely as a brooch or scarf pin."
4.0,"This item was brought for a little girl and she loved it.  I was a scared it was not going to fit, but when she put it on...it was perfect.  She loved it!"
4.0,"It's and easy on/off front closure - but the lace/nylon line is visible under your clothing.  Eh - it is lightly lined and underwired.  It's ok.  But it is NOT going to be my go to by a long shot.  But then I think bras are highly personal and most women don't wear the right size. I wish the cups were larger - covering more - but then,  maybe it works for others."
4.0,"Love them, perfect for groceries. Keep them in my car at all times,"
4.0,Very nice quality and durable.  Great under skirts and dresses in cooler weather.
4.0,A little small for a 'men's' bracelet but good quality.
4.0,Were just as expected. worked as advertised.
4.0,"The Big sister outfit was super cute and perfect for announcing the arrival of our second baby. It's not a huge deal, but I was surprised that the headband came as one long strip of material and was not tied into an actual headband."
4.0,I'd love it if there was a men's to women's size conversion or if they'd make more women's options. Otherwise they're great
4.0,"Fit small. 5’9” , 210 and I went with the xxl.<br /><br />I can’t speak to durability as I’ve only worn them 3x and I hand wash my kits.<br /><br />2nd ride was 73 miles in 90 temps. Bibs were breathable and comfortable the entire day."
4.0,I like the coat. It keeps me warm. I'm usually a small so i bought a large and it's a tiny bit big on me. Keeping me warm through Seattle winter.
4.0,Slightly too large and straps too long.
4.0,"I love the color, and the fabric is good enough, although the thin-ness of the fabric requires shape wear. I’ve mixed feelings about the sort of runched/gathered waistline. It certainly accentuates the waistline, but it’s also a little weird feeling at the same time. I bought two dresses, one sort of rust color and one red. They are the same exact size, although the red one feels like a smaller size. I think I’ll experiment and try to make the dress work, the color is so nice."
4.0,"I love this but I expected it to fit like a body suit & it didn't. It's loose fitting like a jump suit. I'm 5'8&#34; 137lb. & the med/larg was loose on me. Also the knees hit me about 6&#34; above the knee, not like the model.  And it doesn't glow in the dark very much, if at all.  But it was a very fun costume anyway.  The gloves & hat are NOT INCLUDED."
4.0,Nice looking good quality
4.0,This band was extremely quick and easy to install. My only issue is the color is not as vivid as the picture.
4.0,"Un poco pequeño, otras versiones del mismo tamaño tienen más capacidad"
4.0,Love the Pattern! Love the fit! Got so many compliments! I'm a 12-14 and the large fit great.
4.0,The string came out
4.0,a tad heavy
4.0,nice belt but i thought it was going to be 2 inches wide not 1.8
4.0,These are cute legging but they don’t stay up when I’m doing Pilates. The waistband rolls down and it’s super annoying.
4.0,Working out side
4.0,"nice, looks really cute."
4.0,Material is beautiful but fits smaller in the upper arm region.
4.0,"I have two pairs of Savane microfiber slacks that I bought as a newlywed and still wear--almost 20 years later. Needless to say, I'm a fan of any clothing manufacturer that makes items that hold up that well. After trying cotton ""Dockers""-type slacks and watching them fall apart in less than a year (regardless of brand), I'm back to microfiber. It lasts and always looks good.<br /><br />As for these more recent Savane slacks I purchased:<br /><br />PROS<br />* Perfect fit<br />* Drape nicely and looks sharp in pleats<br />* Microfiber breathes well, yet doesn't feel overly cool<br />* Light crosshatch pattern in the weave adds a classic look<br />* Clean stitching, with no loose threads anywhere<br /><br />CONS<br />* Inner waist button attached to waistband liner, not to the waistband itself, so less secure<br />* Amazon's listing of the ""blue"" color is not blue but a navy so dark it is almost indistinguishable from black<br />* More prone to wrinkling than my previous Savane microfiber slacks<br />* Microfiber material in these slacks feels slightly thinner than my older ones<br /><br />Most people will be satisfied with these slacks, I believe. The major concern for those ordering the blue color is that the pair you'll receive will be closer to black than blue. Finding a true lighter-than-navy blue remains difficult in men's slacks today. That's not Savane's issue, though, but how they are described here."
4.0,Looks fresr
4.0,they're comfortable and smoothing!
4.0,"I like it very much but the only thing that I would change is how bright it is, I don't know how to describe it. It's very light too, not heavy at all so that's good. Also the gave me a free glow in the dark bracelet with a little thank you message😂 I thought it was very cute, thank you!"
4.0,My wife has developed a liking for slothes this year so I have purchased her several<br />Sloth masks and she likes them ALL
4.0,Loved the fit and style. Beyond what I originally expected.
4.0,"I'm sure ear size varies between people, but these are way too big even as a conch cuff on my ears even when I try to pinch it tight. Instead I've been wearing it as a midi ring and I think it's cute that way. For reference my hands are quite large and my ring finger is a size 6.5 - 7, so this might fit as a normal ring on your pinky or ring finger if you have smaller hands."
4.0,They did just the job I needed.  My legs were much less tired at the end of the day and totally without pain.
4.0,This is okay. It's a nice every day bag. This is a relief from BLACK all the time = some COLOR.
4.0,"It was good, but I did not like the stone, it would be better if it shone."
4.0,"There really pretty, just smaller than expected."
4.0,Bought for my honeymoon and it’s perfect.  Love it!
4.0,Good Product. Excelent Price!!!
4.0,Love it but it's cut slim on the bust.  If you are big busted keep that in mind
4.0,"Not colored quite as pictured. The whiskering/fading is much more subtle. Very comfy, soft, and stretchy. The size chart is a little generous so size down if between sizes. Runs long soaybe not someone under 5'4"". I'm 5'5.5"" and almost drags the ground with a heel. Drags the ground in sneakers. Has a strong chemical smell that I hope will go away with a few washes. Got complements the first time I wore them. Yay....flare legs!"
4.0,"They are really cute! I definitely like them. They are a little big, though.<br />If you don't feel like wearing the entire earring, you can just wear the head of the fox and it still looks adorable."
4.0,Looks good but have to lose a few pounds for the perfect fit.
4.0,Shipping is fast. The fabric isn’t that great.
4.0,"The skull cap looks nice and the color is the same as in the on line photo.  It seems to stay on my head fairly well, but I have thick curly hair which makes holding in place difficult at best. It also seems to be well made but I have only washed it once in cold water.  I have had and will continue to have chemo drugs for cancer which causes my hair to fall out periodically.  This will be good for that next time I'm sure."
4.0,Ordered 2 sizes bigger than mine and im glad i did. These do run smaller. My daughter wears an xlg and i ordered her a 2xlg and its just a little baggy. Perfect for a jacket. Its a polyester like material which im not the biggest fan of but all in all its a great light weight jacket for cosplay. I would purchase again.
4.0,"I'm a 34B bust 26&#34; waist but have thick arms, so I decided to try a medium. Great fabric soft Cotten sateen feel crisp white and pretty embroidery.<br />Sadly it fit too boxy and not very flattering on me. Perhaps if it were cut a little more tapered at the top or Aline cut it would be more feminine."
4.0,"I have ordered two other pairs of pants from this company, and I wear them all the time. The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is becuase on all 3 pairs that I have ordered,  the picture shows the pants being a different color than what they actually are. The coloring of every pair I have ordered so far has been almost completely different than pictured. In this instance, this particular pair happened to be much darker than what is advertised."
4.0,"I'm petite, so it's a little long, but otherwise is beautiful."
4.0,It's a baby outfit...what's to say?
4.0,I got the orange pair in a size medium. They are very compressive and are NOT see through. My main issue with these leggings is they need to be pulled up fairly high so the scrunch butt hits right and they are not seamless leggings so obviouslyyyyy you are going to get a camel toe in the front. Other than that hahah they are decent.
4.0,"I ordered this bracelet because at the time, I needed a good looking out for. I felt a really nice vibe wearing them. The evil eye beads have always been a huge success in my experience. The only problem I really had with this item is that it got caught on things along, and it would tug and stretch it out. Which started making it more difficult to wear, being much bigger than it was. So I stopped wearing it. It's very pretty, shipped in less than a week, came in good condition. You could love it if you are a little less clumsy than I am."
4.0,Great quality and price. True to the color shown. Loved them
4.0,"This is a very nice set and would be very appropriate to gift.  Both creams smell really good with the sweet scents of lavender and coconut.  Both creams are pretty thick, and they absorb quickly without feeling greasy at all.  I particularly like the hand cream which feels very luxurious, but the foot cream isn't particularly effective on my chapped heels."
4.0,"Update: 2 months in and the stone fell out. I’ve contacted the buyer and they’ve helped out. Overall, it’s still a cute necklace and I would recommend you buy.<br /><br />I’ve had this necklace for about a month and I love it. It holds up in the shower, jogging and looks great."
4.0,"The product arrived quickly.  It is large enough for me to clean even very large silver pieces.  A pair of earrings that were badly tarnished, and unwearable - to my way of thinking, were sitting on my desk for the trial run and they are beautiful now - they look brand new.  Tarnish residue was left on my fingers - but that's part of the process, last I checked.<br />Unfortunately, it seems that some people received and instruction card with the cloth?  This was not the case with my order, therefore, I gave it only four stars."
4.0,"I wanted to love this and I really like it... but my breasts so not fit properly in the cups. I am a 36D/DD and they sadly hang out of the bottom of the top bra part a little. The rest of the top is perfect and I am going to try to modify it so that they will fit comfortably as I really like the top. If the bra part was a little longer it would be perfect.<br /><br />The bottoms are true to size and have the tie strings on the sides so that you can adjust them. One thing to note about the bottoms is that they are not full coverage. If you have a wide or full buttocks they will not cover your entire bottom. This look is super cute if you have a nice looking tushie. You could also exchange out the bottoms for a solid black pair or even a bright pink would look cute.<br /><br />Overall the top and bottoms are very flattering and when I put it on your cannot tell part of my breasts are hanging out. I COULD wear it like this but it would be super uncomfortable. If you have smaller breasts this will probably look and feel amazing on you.<br /><br />In my situation, I do not think doing up to the next size would help as the bottoms would be too large and saggy and the black part of the top would also be too large and the bra part would probably end up too big.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5' 7&#34;, 160 pounds and wear a size L top and 10/11 pants and I ordered this in a Large.<br /><br />I will update my review with photos after modifying the top and actually swimming in it.<br /><br />(PS. I ordered a 2XL from a different company based on their measurement and it is HUGE. I would order true to size for sure.)<br /><br />I bought this at a discounted price in exchange for providing my honest thoughts and opinions in this review. No other compensation was received and I was under no obligation to leave a favorable review."
4.0,"Nice summer dress. I did return for to it was not floor length for me rather an awkward above the ankle but not mid calf, that weird zone where you legs look stumpy. That's just me though. The colors are fantastic though."
4.0,"Good cosplay for a beginner like me who needed something inexpensive and delivered quickly. You pay for what you get – the top, skirt, and belt – which are all very wearable and close to the actual design of Nobara’s uniform. I am 5 ft tall 118 lbs and ordered a size Medium, and everything fit me. SIZE CHARTS ARE YOUR FRIEND!!! I recommend wearing a white shirt or tank top underneath, since the top is very cropped and tends to ride up if you lift your arms. The material is quite thin, but this might be good for summer cons where it’s hot. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and believe it meets all my cosplay needs for this summer’s convention."
4.0,"GARMENT WELL SEWN, COLOR TOO DARK, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED"
4.0,"Looks good and is very comfortable, but it's a little small.  The sweatshirt is fine once I get it on, but getting it on and off is a bit of pain as the neck hole is too small."
4.0,"I wore these with black satin pajamas to a late night Prohibition Era jazz party. I suck at wearing heels, plus have flat feet, so I chose these and were able to wear them for hours."
4.0,"weird silky material that moves freely, a little too big"
4.0,"I like the material and the color, when I put on it, i feel very comfortable,but it is very looser"
4.0,"The gel comes in a smaller than expected bottle, but a little goes a long way. I give the place of purchase a 5 star, package was lost and they resent it at no additional cost.  Great customer service!"
4.0,"These sweaters are very soft and the colors are very pretty. However, there are some sizing issues.<br />With the first set I purchased, the black and white in a size large, there was no way to tell the front from the back, and they were both very big and I was kinda swimming in them. There actually are some tiny tags sewn into the blue and pink sweaters, but the front and back pieces were still cut the same and I personally still could not tell the difference. All four mock necks still have the same issue, which is that they kinda look wavy on the edges and not very crisp and clean, and do not appear to be even in height all the way around on your neck.<br />I sized down when I ordered the pink and blue to a medium this time because the black and white were so huge, but that was actually a mistake. The colors must all fit differently maybe? The blue and pink were way too tight and short, especially in the neck and chest. I had to return them, unfortunately, because they are lovely.<br />For reference, I am 5’9”, 129 lbs, 36” bust circumference.<br />I hope this is info is somehow helpful. I do think these sweaters are beautiful."
4.0,just have to get it hemmed fits very well
4.0,"not bad now got it so with continuous wear, il give a much better refview"
4.0,Bought these for my granddaughter. She loves them! She likes gadgets so charging them up is a thrill.
4.0,Comfy material and nice style. Had to return due to way too long
4.0,Super shiny
4.0,Cozy! Keeps the cold wind off my face and works well with hooded parka.
4.0,"I loved this coat.  It was too big though. I’m 5’8”, 224 lbs.  I ordered a size XXL. Sending back and getting a size XL.  Only 4 stars because the flaps do not lead to real pockets.  Wish it had pockets."
4.0,"It was a lovely dress, but it just wasn’t my type of dress"
4.0,Have not got the yet but my wife is going to love them she calls it her look. I guess it will go good with the rest of her cat ears.
4.0,The color is more brass than gold and it fit very tight on my wrist
4.0,Solid construction
4.0,"The flowers comes off easily, other than that the sandals were great for the outfit. Might need a hot glue gun to keep them from falling off"
4.0,Made of durable material and will last through workouts.
4.0,"They look great, but run a little small.  I like them though!"
4.0,"I wish there was a 3 1/2 star because this wasn't the best shirt I have ever found but it wasn't the worst. To start, a pro is definitely the material & the color. It is light weight & stretchy & the color is true to the burgundy shown in the picture. Because it's stretchy that works s both an advantage & a disadvantage. This shirt can we worn as a dress or a somewhat slouchy shirt (as shown in the picture). What I didn't notice while viewing the picture is that the sleeves are tight fitted to the elbow then become loose. The bottom of the shirt is the same way & can literally be pulled down & made into a dress. I am 5'3&#34; & weigh 115. This shirt/dress was big/loose fitted everywhere except in the arms which are a bit tight. I will keep this shirt, but hope that someone gets a better idea of their purchase from this thorough review."
4.0,Very nice case and protective bag within. Glasses are great for fishing especially the bifocal for knots on mono line. Would purchase these again.
4.0,"The material doesn't feel like cotton, so not as soft as I was hoping. But cute design- just hot material."
4.0,"Nice product. I purchased to keep items organized in our large beach bag for vacation. However, I thought that these bags were entirely mesh, but they are not - they are plastic bags with a mesh outer-lay. I really see the point of the mesh outer-lay, except if you want to make the contents of your bag a bit more confidential (you can still see the contents, though). Really for me, all the mesh did was trap sand between it and the plastic bag lining, so it was a bit annoying. But they are well made, and the zipper is very sturdy, and the carbine is a nice touch as well."
4.0,"It came way sooner than scheduled, t was really nice and it's super cute, well made... only issue is it says &quot;newborn to 12 month&quot; but it's HUGE on my 8 month old so it's definitely not for a newborn."
4.0,"Love these glasses! They are nice oversized, not too big. You can still see your eyebrows over the top of them. Love the print. Not exactly mirrored, but I love the cat eye effect! Great inexpensive pair of sunglasses!"
4.0,"fits well and more importantly, washes well."
4.0,Although its nicely made... I wish it was smaller .. for the price its great but I cant see me using it much... medium is just too big :(
4.0,Ahhh dang. This was the best belt I ever owned until it broke. You should buy this but I'm hoping I can get a replacement....I need to check. This is a GREAT belt in my oppinion.
4.0,"I absolutely love these shoes! They are adorable! I would have given them five stars, but they rub like crazy. I'm trying to tough it out in hopes that they just need to be broken in because they're too cute. I have a feeling I'm gonna have blisters though."
4.0,It fitted nice... love the cuts on it
4.0,Not quite as slouchy as picture implies. Lightweight material wicks well
4.0,"This is a comfortable hat that is great for walking at night.  It has a nice long bill to shade your eyes in the daylight.<br />The elastic sleeve which houses the battery holder, is quite a tight fit.  Once you get the hang of it it is ok.<br />You can turn the lights on/off while still in the sleeve and also change the light mode.  That is good.<br />To charge it you need a usb charger which is not included.  Most people have chargers so no big deal.<br />The only thing I would improve is you need to remove the battery to charge it.  There doesn't appear to be a way to know when it is fully charged or needs charging until it goes off.  I think you will enjoy this novelty hat. There was no information included with the hat. I like mine!"
4.0,always nice to wear these.
4.0,"This fits well (very stretchy actually; I could easily have gotten a size smaller) and feels great (very smooth fabric, almost like it isn't there). It is very flexible, making stretching no issue.<br /><br />However, it is a bit see-through! Lighter colors are fine under it, but I wore black under it and in studio lighting you could slightly see that (for reference, I got the crimson one).<br /><br />Also, although it fits nicely, it is not that durable. I used it for doing lyra, and wherever it hit the bar, even if only a little, it developed little nibs (photo for reference- this is after one wear); although it didn't tear, I'm concerned that it might if I do anything especially rough. This was never an issue with my cotton leotards.<br /><br />In short: It seems like it would be a wonderful choice for things like dance or silks, but if you need it for anything that can be rough on fabric like trapeze or lyra, this is not the best choice."
4.0,I ordered one size larger and it fit beautifully. I like the classy business fit.
4.0,I like this type of dress. I have LOTS of this style dress in different colors.
4.0,Cannot replace footed so does not last as well as expected.
4.0,A hat is a hat is a hat but this one somehow felt more comfortable than most of my winter knit hats. I would make this a five star recommendation if I could find the words to explain why.
4.0,these are a little bigger then my glasses but work well.
4.0,Nice belt. The quality is good and the elastic doesn't roll over. Great for the price
4.0,"The dress was way too long. The fit was nice and it does hug the body well. Even with heels, the dress still touched the ground for me. I'm 5'4&#34; and it looks like it would be more suitable for someone who is 5'8&#34; and wearing heels. The material and design is really nice. I may just bring it to get it hemmed a bit on the bottom. If you like the dress sliding all across the floor, this might work for you. If you're like me and want it to barely sweep the ground with heels, you'll want to make sure you're a bit taller. It does look nice though!"
4.0,Fits kinda small just make sure to order one size bigger
4.0,These are great for add ones to molle vest.
4.0,"Great overall, fits as expected"
4.0,"Nice quality. I think the 2 studs are too large for the size of the star, would have looked better with 1 smaller stud and made the star the main focus. Very sparkly."
4.0,I love the color and the length. The material is very comfortable.
4.0,"I like it, but I think that Skinny tie bars would be better if the wide were the same as the regular tie bars, as accessory it's barely visible.<br /><br />All other specs are great."
4.0,I like the material and how it fits. Thank you!! The only thing I don’t like is that it won’t be thick enough to wear during the winter.
4.0,It put a smile on a child face
4.0,she like it very much.
4.0,The ties are not high enough and the top of yhe boot stays open.
4.0,"Bought 3 and all are VERY large. Bought large which is my usual size, more like Women's sizes, very long and very wide. No use to me, but they arrived the evening before a trip and it is too late to return.  Very pretty and good quality."
4.0,"I ordered two 10.5"" shoes, one for me and one for my daughters boyfriend as a gift. I wear size 10 but these were a little tight sliding my foot in - I would order a size 11 but expect the 10.5 to wear in a bit and fit better"
4.0,"Runs a little small but,"
4.0,"Really good item, good quality and comfortable, big poket."
4.0,"Very Nice, Great gift for a girls first cross"
4.0,"They are so cute the stones are nice and lightweight, they hang the perfect length for me. the colors are vibrant, I have ordered more colors, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,after about a year it is starting to fall apart and is very large. when i first started using it i didnt have that much i needed to put in it but at this point its not worth it.
4.0,"I've had a few F91W series watches, and they've all been reliable.  They're so inexpensive, and run so long on the original batteries, they're pretty much disposable.  Over the years, I've bought several of these watches - not to wear on my wrist, but to strap them to my backpack, mount on my bike, and keep in my camp packs.  These are excellent and accurate timepieces to have around, to quickly tell time when your hands are occupied.  Just to try it out, however, I put a new F91W-1 watch on my wrist...  Or, rather, I ~tried~ to put it onto my wrist, but it didn't fit.  I'm not Lou Ferigno or The Big Show, and I could barely touch the tip of the strap to the very tip of the buckle.  I compared it to my older F91W, and it too had a small strap.  A no-name watch from Hong Kong with another &#34;standard men's strap&#34; was a good centimeter longer.  It's not a problem for me, since I don't plan on wearing it, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing this watch.  As a timepiece, the F91W-1 still great.  Accurate, rugged, water resistant, inexpensive and very plain looking.  I'll trust my life to it as a timepiece, but apparently I won't be wearing them unless I buy a new strap."
4.0,My arms are larger so I ordered up to account for it. Still the arms are a little snug. Overall soft and cute though
4.0,"I'm giving this swimsuit 4 stars because it so cute on, however if your bust size is D or above and you usually rely on underwire this is not the suit for you."
4.0,"I love the sophisticated look of this watch! It's comfortable and goes well with almost any outfit (both very dressy and casual). I have only two complaints against this watch: it came with a tiny scratch on the glass face and even the smallest adjustment of the wristband was too large for me, so I had to pierce the leather wristband for a smaller hole for the buckle. So men with small wrists, know you will probably have to take a hammer and nail to the wristband as did I."
4.0,"I bought this ring for my husband as I liked the price for the look.  It is a decent ring, but not as dazzling as a diamond.  It seems as if it is going to be sturdy enough for him as he works outside a lot and uses his hands a lot.  So for titanium it is a very good deal.  One of the cons is that when you move the CZ gems in there move to and you can hear it.  They should have put more in it or somehow made them stay in place.  I just didn't like that cause it made it sound cheap.  But if you are looking into not spending a lot for a titanium ring this would be a good choice.  The ring was also true to size.  I give honest reviews and got my discounted price from amzreviewtrader.com"
4.0,Super cute bonnets. As described.
4.0,"It seems that it would trap liquids, as there is fabric on top of plastic.  But it doesn't make noise or anything.  My problem is that while the underwear overall fits fine, the band is VERY tight.  I'm not sure if I should go a size up because the rest of the underwear might be too big."
4.0,The end kept coming unknotted so I had to glue them. It fits perfect.
4.0,Was very cute gift
4.0,"The grey one is great! Classic and goes well with most suits. The other one though has metallic, silvery threads so the tie sparkles. The pink stripe is very summer-y and fun, but the sparkles in the tie make it almost kitsch-y. My husband will never wear  a sparkley tie.<br /><br />The quality seems decent and is in a standard tie size. Not thin like the hipster ties but not comically large like from the 70s. Just standard."
4.0,These boots look great and are mostly comfortable.  I went off the size chart for my husband and measured down half a size then normal and they are snug. I would base it off your standard shoe size. I also got him the wide and found them to be a little more skinny then to be expected. They are extremely light and he says he can wear them for hours with out feeling weighed down. He hasen't had any issues with water but don't really work in that type of environment.
4.0,This is cut with some extra room through the bust which might be good for someone who is bustier. But through the hip it has a straighter cut so if you have hips this blouse will be more form fitting through that area. Cold shoulder style blouses are on of my favorite design features so that part i love.
4.0,Little larger than I thought but very cute! Soft and comfortable. Great for leggings and a night shirt around the house.
4.0,"They cover the face comfortably. They are very thin and can break if not careful or have many uses. But they are still strong enough to last many times if careful. I am not sure of their real protective value though. The viruses may get in or out more than surgical masks because the fabric appears more breathable.  But they cover the face and are approved by the gym where I go and help me breathe heavily while working out without fogging up my glasses as much as paper, surgical or cloth masks. So these masks are good for the gym for me since they are more breathable. Since these masks do not cost too much I am willing to buy them repeatedly for use in the gym."
4.0,very nice addition to my nomination/zoppini bracelet.
4.0,"Wore most of the day without much discomfort. Shipped promptly in time for Halloween. The picture might be deceiving, since there is no attached nose involved, only a clip for the nose to attach whiskers."
4.0,"First, I did receive these glasses free for the purpose of testing and review. While I recognize that a review of a free product is fundamentally different from that of a product for which one has paid, I do take the review process seriously and hope that my findings will prove useful to you in your decision making. If you have questions about these glasses, feel free to post them in the comments section and I'll do my best to answer based on my own experience.<br /><br />What you're getting with this order:<br />(1) Pair half frame wrap around sunglasses<br /><br />I'm a runner and have come to prefer this half frame wrap around style for my exercise.  This particular pair has a couple of features that I really like, so I'll cover those first.  These glasses have an extreme curvature that starts curving from the bridge and keeps right on going so that the ends of the ear pieces (when the arms are fully open) are only about 3 inches apart.  This makes for a tight fit which is excellent for sports and has been great for my running.  This curvature also brings the lenses past the lateral eye and out to the temple on each side.  This has the added effect of blocking sunlight from the sides which is also excellent for running and for other sports.  In addition, both the earpieces and the nose pieces are silicone and help to grip a bit tighter for a sports fit.<br /><br />Build:  This is a solid build that justifies the price point. Hinges are smooth with no hesitation noted.  Ear pieces and nose pieces fit well and have no wobble or give.  The lenses sit in their half frames snugly with no movement noted.<br /><br />Sun protection: The glasses are not polarized, but they do offer 400 UV protection.<br /><br />Anything else of note?: As of the posting of this review, the glasses are being offered with free shipping.<br /><br />Any negatives?:<br />-Some may find the bridge is too wide.<br />-X-loop logo just slightly off center<br /><br />Bottom line: These half frame wrap-arounds are well built and justify their mid $20 price point.  The extreme curvature of the arms facilitates a snug fit that is beneficial for sports like running, softball etc.. They offer full eye coverage and 400UV protection and are currently being offered with free shipping.  I like these for running and am happy to recommend them to anyone looking to maximize quality at the upper end of the budget price range. Enjoy!"
4.0,Didn't hang right so I made it an ankle bracelet looks good
4.0,Nice product for gift.
4.0,"A bit long. (I'm 5'3"") but comfortable"
4.0,"Really nice, soft material. Fit a little smaller than expected."
4.0,"This is a nice and cute dress. The christmas hat design is perfect for the holiday season. The fabric is smooth to the touch, breathable and stretchy. The fabric is also  thin so it's a bit see through. You might want to put a clothing underneath this dress. The dress is just the right fit so it is comfortable to wear. I think this is fun to wear with a matching hat while giving out christmas presents for your kids. Its like you are the female version of santa. You'll only wear this kind of dress during christmas though."
4.0,It is ok for the price. Preetty dress.
4.0,"If you are both of a slender build and also have small boobs, this is gonna be really loose fitting. Go for this if you are a size 6 and over, OR if you are a C cup and over."
4.0,"It's cute and I like it enough to keep wearing it. I get complements every time. However, I always feel like I'm going to flash someone- there is little support up top, and with it being a stretchy material and a halter, unless you tie it really tight (which would hurt my neck), it feels like it sits low on my chest. That being said, it's not particularly tight around the waist.  So, basically, it just fits oddly. But it's good enough for the price."
4.0,"Love it, nice figure and makes you sweat"
4.0,"the 1st one i got had brown spots all over it. i was not sure if they are suppose to have them so i asked about it. the company was very nice and sent out a 2nd one without me even asking. it is light pink with orange in it and does have a few spots but not as bad as the 1st one. it is very pretty.very long and very wide. great for head,neck or even as a cover for arms"
4.0,"My granddaughter likes it.  Pump for the braid didn't work consistantly, but she's 3, so she just likes having an Elsa hat..."
4.0,It was as expected.  I wish it had pockets but it serves well for my purpose.  The sleeves seem a little short.
4.0,Quality eyewear .. good construction
4.0,"This is super adorable! It is pretty big, and the starfish did come off, so I had to put it back on, but it's still worth it for the price! It's super shiny :)"
4.0,"I wish I could 5-star this, because the quality and appearance are stellar. But the design has the clasp hanging on the inside of the band, and it's almost 10mm thick at that spot. Very clumsy.<br /><br />Such a clunky way to do the clasp, I almost gave it 3 stars -- but the quality truly is exceptional. If you can live with the bulky clasp, you'll be happy. I'm not though."
4.0,as described. size is as expected.
4.0,"Super cute. Clearly not made of expensive materials, but not uncomfy. You'll need to iron it. The zipper is terrible around the waist, though, hence four stars instead of five."
4.0,I love this dress is true size. I order a small. I'm 5'6 and wear size 4 in dresses size the dress was below my knees and it fit just right.
4.0,Mittens themselves are decent. String broke almost instantly however.
4.0,Beautiful blue color. Beware - short - ordered smallest and I'm only 5'5. Flattering. Good price.  Thin material. Soft.
4.0,"The product is very good, but narrow. If you are between sizes, I suggest that you buy the larger size."
4.0,"I have multiple pairs of silk underwear.  These boxer briefs feel good like silk should and stretch accordingly.  However, I would prefer a slightly more giving cut in the front.  It's a little tighter than I prefer yet not uncomfortable.  However, that being said, I like the blue color, the cost factor, and the look they have on me.  I will buy more and would recommend them.  Depending on your preferences for cut in the front, you might want to order a size up from what size you currently buy in boxer briefs."
4.0,Love the ligo and but a little  time for not having a filter
4.0,I wanted to give this product 5 stars but it was cut small and material was a little too soft making it hard to put on. But other than that it was a cute stylishish kiddie shoe and my son absolutely loves the squeaker!!
4.0,Cute. Good quality.
4.0,"I like the material because it can easily be wiped off. I didn't like the strap it came with, it looked cheap. So I purchased a wrist strap and now I love it!"
4.0,"I like the bag, the quality; it's spacious, yet small.  I do not like the way the zipper was sewn"
4.0,They are different and comfortable. If you are bigger than a size 12 I don’t recommend. I’m a 12 and the waist is slightly tight. The material is a lightweight rayon more than a linen. Washing may be a problem.
4.0,Pretty sturdy and look like they’re pictured. A little short though.
4.0,"This is a over-sized spacious bag with comfortable wide straps for the shoulder or hand. I like to use this bag when I go to my weekend classes. It can carry a lot more than I expected. I can fit couple of books, tablet, portable powerbank and pen/pencil. It holds everything I needed it for and then some more. It has a huge pocket inside that separates the bag into two parts. The canvas material is a thick, very nice quality, not bulky. The large rings by the handles are great for me to clip my keys so I don't loose them. It come with a detachable adjustable shoulder strap, versitle in that I can wear on shoulder or as a crossbody.  Only downside I have with the bag is the main zipper doesn't go totally to the end of the bag but it zips far enough to close the bag."
4.0,"As far as quality, these seems to be a nice headband for those who like the turban headband look.  It is quite stretchy.  I was initially afraid that it was too stretchy and would not stay on, but I've not had any trouble with it.  I haven't found any manufacturing errors in it either.  My only warning is to comparison shop because the listing at the time of this review makes it a poor value."
4.0,"These work as advertised, but beware:  the snaps are jagged and stick out quite a bit.  They will snag.  You won't want to sit on a nice couch or easy chair with these on.  I have worn other suspenders that are smooth although they probably don't hold the trousers as securely.  Just be careful."
4.0,It was a gift for our grandma she loved it
4.0,"I like this shirt a lot, the only issue is it fits smaller than expected. I would definitely recommend ordering a size or 2 up depending on how loose of a fit you like. Overall the material is soft and I like the muscle tank style!"
4.0,This thing is HUGE. I never thought I had a smaller than average head until I tried this thing on.<br />It will work for what I need though.<br />Price should probably be more around $5 for the quality though.
4.0,I like it .... very slenderizing and comfortable
4.0,The anklets look really nice together but the one with the evil eye was thicker then expected and the charm was kinda big. Overall a good quality
4.0,"First off, these are pretty awesome. Really like how realistic they look when they are in. Not very heavy and are nicely weighted. My only complaints would be that if you leave them in while sleeping it can be a little uncomfortable and there is a risk of getting poked in the neck depending on the direction of your piercings (the backs are pointy). Also, I've been wearing the black ones and have noticed that after about three weeks or so the finish is starting to wear off, but that seems fairly normal and not much of a big deal. Overall though these are awesome!"
4.0,So comfortable!!!!  Runs a little big.
4.0,Beautiful set.  I get a lot of complements.  The stones are yellow instead of golden in the pucture.
4.0,Have one and copper color was starting to show so wanted another and might order one for a friend. Only wish I could get it in stainless steel or Sterling silver so I could wear it all the time
4.0,Love the shirt!  I read product reviews and bought a bit large. Do not do it! Mine was way too large. Buy your size.
4.0,The necklace came when expected. It looked just like described in picture. It goes well with casual outfits.
4.0,well made.  looks nice for what it is!
4.0,"I read the other comments and took the advice of applying clear finger nail polish to prevent my finger from turning green.  The polish trick works.  It's a nice ring, but the center stone does look fake.  It sits quite high on the finger as well.  Not bad for the price of costume jewelry.  the setting is pretty."
4.0,"The sweater snags easily so be careful.  When I first received the shirt, there was already a snag in it. Amazon gave me a partial refund for that.  They’re great like that.  I ordered an xl because I thought this sweater ran small, but it doesn’t.  I kept the XL, but I could have bought a large. I’m 5’3 165 lbs 41,35,42."
4.0,Good quality tie but I wish the Buffaloes text was a shade darker and easier to see.
4.0,"Love the print, color, fabric. Glad I ordered 2 sizes larger so it fits like the photo. Is NOT true to size."
4.0,"I love the watch:  very simple, elegant, looks more expensive than it is. The bangles are not at all my style, and just make the simple watch look cheap.  I tossed the bangle bracelets.  Still, a good buy.  (I did take out one link of the watchband:  I like it loose but it was just too loose and got in the way.  An easy sizing solution.)"
4.0,"I bought this dress for myself in two colors and sizes (SMALL and MEDIUM). I'm 5'4"" and wear a size 6, and really I couldn't tell a difference in the sizes or lengths.  The dress nips in nicely at the waist and has a nice flow and feel.  I would have kept the small.  Anyway, I'd decided to return the dresses because of the prints.  The dark green floral print was too dark.  The gray-pink floral print was lovely, except the  print and heathering are screenprinted onto the dress, and the patterns aren't matched at the seams.  The screenprinted heathering especially looked cheap on me at my age (40).  Then my teenager tried on the small gray-pink floral, and it was adorable on her.  The screenprinting looks fine on teenagers, even suitable.  She kept it and loves it!"
4.0,"Nice quality, strong magnet. The only complaint would be that the color has some pinkish tint to it."
4.0,"Silver ring lost its shine after a couple wears, but others have been just as expected."
4.0,Very cute and happy with purchase
4.0,Nice as described good fit. I think I could have found a nicer product for the price I paid. but there no issues with the hoodie.
4.0,The teal/navy colors are beautiful but it fits a little tight in the arms and chest. I am generally between a medium and large and ordered a medium in this dress. Returning and hoping they get a large in stock :/.
4.0,For the price it is fine .
4.0,"The material is very stretchy.<br />It’s not the normal blazer that you may be thinking.<br />Would be cuter if there was a button.<br />It will serve its purpose.<br />I went a size up just to be careful, & I was correct."
4.0,Got this for a great price...not leather but it is cute and comfy.
4.0,"Nice fabric and print. Irons easily to look sharp. Pocket matches the background and blends into shirt. As the picture shows, it is cut straight up & down rather than flaring slightly for people with extra weight around the middle, but it looks nice."
4.0,"Obviously, I knew that buying this bag for only $9.99 that I wasn’t going for super high-quality but my expectations were still exceeded actually! It is a super cute bag that has an interior small zipper area and can fit a decent amount of stuff. It’s zips all the way closed and really my only complaint is that the little faux lock is the one thing that gives away the price point because the small strip of orange “leather” that goes across the center of the lock was glued on so poorly. I’m tempted to just peel it off and re-glue it myself so that it looks a little bit better. It comes with a long strap you can clip on the outside if you want to wear the bag like that but there’s enough space to wear the bag over your shoulder even without adding the longer strap. It’s a nice orange color pretty close to the picture. Not bright or neon but definitely more orange than brown or rust, so just be aware. I wouldn’t consider it a “neutral” tone. Happy with this purchase overall"
4.0,Great earrings! A little longer then expected but very well made. I recommend if you have longer hair you wear it back when wearing these. Looks great with everything from jeans to a night out. Would definitely purchase again.
4.0,I wish the print was on both sides but otherwise they are wonderful
4.0,"The denim is a good quality--not too thin and not too heavy. I was looking for a light-weight denim riding tight for the hot summer months and think these would do the job. The only problem was that they are much too large; I was actually able to pull them on without unbuttoning or unzipping. Another brand I purchased from Dover in the same size ended up being too small. The agonies of women's fashion.<br />The jodphurs have an elastic foot strap to hold the legs down over your boot, and the boot cut cuff is especially nice for those of us who don't want to look like Olivia Newton John in Grease when we have to pop into a store after being at the barn.<br />Overall, these were a great quality product and very comfortable, so I've ordered a replacement pair in a smaller size."
4.0,Nice. I like them
4.0,Perfect fit! Love this dress. Gives you an elegant look and very stylish too! Must have in your wardrobe! This was a great dress for the church function I went too!
4.0,Purchased as just a casual dress.  Fit it as expected.  I was looking for a &#34;t-shirt&#34; type material.  This is a little thinner.  It's very comfortable.  I didn't think I would like the pockets but do.  This will look cute in the fall/winter with a cardigan or jean jacket.
4.0,These are nice face masks. They have nice adjustable ear straps and come in many different patterns.
4.0,I bought this product to help with plantar fasciitis pain.<br />It has worked well for me.<br />It is a quality product and I'd recommend it to anyone  who this issue.
4.0,This is a 22” hat in cream color with top crown shape & well shaped all over. The brim is 1.5” making this hat simply trendy for a casual event. The band (1 “ wide  in black and off-white stripes) & sweat band are both 1 “ &  black.<br />It looks to me could be unisex and one size fits all. The good thing is that is slightly stretchy and adjusts well with my long hair if I feel like not showing much of it.  It’s a fashion statement wearing this hat and the rest of the clothes follows the attitude!
4.0,This dress is adorable but was too tight in the chest area on me. I had to send it back but overall a nice dress. I would not recommend it if you have a large chest.
4.0,"The cuffs are very cute, but do not seem durable. I have very small wrists, and these sort of stay on them but not for the entire day. For the price, I think these are a good deal."
4.0,Modest without being frumpy<br />A little hard getting on and off
4.0,Nice shoes but we returned them because they seemd to run a little big and would have been uncomfortable sliding up and down on the heel for all day at a wedding for a little boy.
4.0,"Tough buying on line, color was as described and it fit well"
4.0,My daughter says it's pretty and she loves it
4.0,Didn't care for see-thru lace at waist & neckline lace a little picky
4.0,Love the length. Bought XL But could have worn a L.
4.0,"I like it a lot.  It does just what it says it does.  The Elastic holds tightly and I cant forcefully fling the cards or cash out of the sleeve.  It holds all the cards I have, and the slots make it easy to get the cards in/out.  Not sure about the RFID blocking though.  As you can see in the photos the chip shows through the gaps in the carbon fiber.  I'm not sure how that will affect the RFID Blocking.  Tempted to get an RFID scanner just to test it, but that would be an expensive test."
4.0,I followed the measurements guide and it fit perfectly. I like a classic style and that is what I got. The fabric is nice and not too giving but not too structured either.  The hem is below the knee.  Please note this dress runs small. I've never bought a dress this large :).<br /><br />My only complaint is I did not receive the belt.
4.0,bigger than i thought/......
4.0,"Great length and comfortable.  I ordered the small in purple (I'm 5'5&#34;, 125 lbs) and my only issue is that the chest area is see through.  I also ordering a medium and it gapped at the armpits.  I will keep the small but had to order a black racerback crop top to wear underneath the dress.  Not a deal breaker, but something to consider."
4.0,Calvin Klein swimsuits are great quality.  They also have removable cup pads.  i have 3 in different colors.
4.0,"Great quality, fits as expected, great price for the three pairs. The purple ones are actually more of a blue color."
4.0,These are stunning.  Wore them on a cruise for formal night and got many compliments.  The only reason for 4 stars is that they are heavy.
4.0,Nice design. Just eish the lobster claw clasp was larger. Hard to open. Looks wonderful with the pendant I had. Very elegant.
4.0,The shirt sizes run large but after exchanging a larger for a medium it meets my expectations.
4.0,the pearls on mine were baby pink. not white like the picture
4.0,This suit is perfect for a active day on the water without having to give up the cute factor.
4.0,"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this. It works well enough but it can't replace a full multitool.<br /><br />If you want an inexpensive multi-tool for your wallet, this is for you. If you want a full multi-tool then spend the money to get a leathermans."
4.0,Buena calidad...mas pequeños de lo esperado..buena presentacion...
4.0,This top is super cute. The color is a little richer than expected. It was a tad too small for me but fit my sister perfectly. I love the length and softness of it.
4.0,I had read some reviews saying they were bad. I must have been a lucky one. There may have been 2 or 3 that were somewhat tarnished but nothing a Mr Clean eraser didn't fix. Sweet saying. I made key rings...but you could use them in any craft.
4.0,"I love boots, I pretty much want every kind in every color. I saw these and knew I had to have them. After receiving them I worn them asap, they did hurt my feet a little but only because I have somewhat wider feet since having my last baby. I know that if my feet weren't so wide they would fit perfect and feel good! I totally ignore the tightness for how cute these boots are. Now to go get some in the other 2 colors!<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest unbiased review."
4.0,"I liked it & had no issues except, the black nose ring does start to chip after a little while, & it finally got bad enough that I took it out; it was very noticeable. Black was the only color that I had this bad of a problem with.<br /><br />*Side note: Pay attention to the size, THEY ARE THICK!"
4.0,Very nice bathing suit. I was worried about sizing but I followed the chart and it fits true to size. It's very flattering in the mid section and has good co coverage for a big bust.
4.0,"Super cute and a good size, looks like an expensive purse but Zipper isn’t the best."
4.0,I loved it! Wrapped around my braids nicely
4.0,"They fit nicely. Completely satisfied. Sizes do run small, so just order one size up. That's what I did, and they're perfect."
4.0,This hat would have been GREAT if the ear flaps covered the ears like muffs.  But it's still quite fine for brisk fall or light winter.  It looks good and its brim works to protect against snow or sun.  All in all a winner.
4.0,Quality dress with a good price. Went off sizing chart and should have gone with my normal size. Bought an XL (5’3” /190#) should have gone with a large.
4.0,This is a beautiful little dress. Perfect the holidays. Or anytime. I bought the red one. It's a stunning wine color. It came in lovely packaging with a cute necklace. What a nice surprise. I am 5'1 and wear a size 16. It fit  very nice and wasn't too long on me like a lot of these dresses tend to be. This company seems to understand plus size. I will be buying more.
4.0,Nice earring would of made a better impression if the pakaging was better like a gift box to keep the earring in instead of a plastic zipper bag stuffed in a small velvet sac earrings
4.0,"Work great for my grandson. but too large for me.  These glasses are nice but being a teenager in the 60's they're nowhere near what we wore back then.  The roundness of these glasses are too big.  If they would make them a bit smaller in roundness, they'd be perfect and I'd buy more"
4.0,"This dress was really cute, and I probably would have kept it, but I wasn't a fan of the cold shoulder look for my body type. As a petite (yet curvy) woman, it was a flattering fit and flare style, and the length was good. I considered trying to alter the sleeves, but I didn't want to mess with that."
4.0,I used to add to kids waistband on school uniform. Worked well.
4.0,Very classy dress. Wore to a November wedding.
4.0,"Belt is a bit stiff but, I guess that is necessary to maintain a good appearance.  Other than the stiffness, everything is good."
4.0,hair clips came off and had to repair with glue gun. No big deal - nice hat
4.0,"it’s kinda small,,, i washed it but idk if it’s gonna shrink or not i haven’t checked yet pray for me"
4.0,Will do a review as I purchased for my aunt and has not worn yet.
4.0,Love this.  Worn it at least 20 times already.<br />Comfy (may need tank under)<br /><br />But it recently got itchy at the end of the sleeve and i look and its sewn with plastic????
4.0,I love my ring. My only complaint is that it does leave a greenish residue on my thumb after I wear it.  But a good wash with soap gets it off.
4.0,i am a guy. fits perfectly as a bracelet :) just pulled off the hand of fatima! nice quality looks great often get compliments on it!
4.0,"Love the feel and the design, but our toddler is too little to wear these without them falling off all the time."
4.0,It’s pretty but the little screw breaks easily had to order a replacement
4.0,Scarf is cotton/polyester blend that is quite soft and is not scratchy.  I have sensitive skin and don't like anything around my neck that scratches or irritates.  This material is fine for me.  It is warm enough for a chilly day yet not heavy or bulky.  The scarf arrived promptly and is as described.  I will order additional colors.
4.0,"It's been a long time coming, but Andrew Christian has finally put out a version of their net briefs with the larger 'Trophy Boy' style pouch, and it was definitely worth waiting for.<br /><br />If you've worn any of their other net style briefs, one thing you might have noticed is the fabric has a bit less give (elasticity) to it than, say, the model/rayon/bamboo style, or even the polyamide. It's probably more on par with the polyester offerings than anything else and, while not uncomfortable, isn't -as- comfortable, especially if you're average, much less bigger. Here though, with the addition of the larger pouch, what you finally end up with is a superbly comfortable and wearable version of the net brief. The extra room makes all the difference, letting everything hand the way nature intended, rather than awkwardly bunching up, which I find happens with regular style net briefs. As with all the net briefs, these breath very well and even after wearing them all day, you'll barely notice they're there. Extremely comfortable and functional at keeping things dry.<br /><br />Fit and finish are good, despite being made in China. Unfortunately, the product being made in China is a pet peeve when charging designer prices, so I'll have to deduct a star for that. If they were made in Thailand like some of the other offerings, I would easily give it the full five stars. Unfortunately, made in China does not carry the connotation of quality, and probably never will, so it's too much of a slap in the face to ignore.<br /><br />On the modesty side, these briefs are not nearly as revealing as some of the mesh style offerings, or the gigolo series of briefs, but they don't leave much to the imagination either. Depending on the lighting and how close you are, not to mention how well you fill them out, you may not want to sport these in a locker room or similar. Of course if you've no shame in your game and don't mind the attention, these will do the trick without being too overtly immodest. To put it another way, it isn't obscene, but it certainly will raise eyebrows.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the net briefs in general, I definitely recommend picking up a pair of these. I liked them so much, I ordered a second pair. My only real regret, other than issues with the country of origin, is that they don't offer any other colors."
4.0,"I love this tank but~it is shorter in length than I thought. Because I use it as an under layer, it's a good tank but, if you have an average or long torso, do know that it will not be a longer tank. I am 5'4, 40 yrs old, 135lbs, and a 34Cbra. hope that helps !"
4.0,"Nice, but will not hold anything over 1/2 lbs. The clasp opened up twice on its own."
4.0,"Cute top, but the black color looks a little faded."
4.0,"absolutely love the colors and pattern! However, it was way too cheeky for me so I had to return."
4.0,This product works wonders! My glasses don’t slip off anymore! They stay stuck to my face. The only negative about this is your ears will start to feel sore after a few hours of wearing these that’s why I gave it 4 stars but other than that they really do work 👍🏻
4.0,Worked as she expected.
4.0,Received item superfast. My only complaint was that they were rounder than I would like. Spoke to the company on Instagram and was advised that the smaller sizes are normally rounder. Can't want to go bigger. Thanks!
4.0,Nice quality but runs way too small
4.0,I love the top just a little smaller around the waist then expected but will be returning to purchase more from carrier
4.0,Runs a little large but great if you’re going to wear it over layers. Seems well constructed. Bought it as a gift and he was pleased!
4.0,"Everything was good except for the clasp. It was slightly broke, so it wasn't secure. I'll probably just replace the chain. The pendant is great."
4.0,"nice fit , but i had to buy  larger waist size then i normally do.  when  i bought a pair 2 sizes larger in the waist they fit beautifully and look sharp"
4.0,These in size Large fit more snug than the same style of pants in size Large by this brand. I don't understand. It's not a huge difference but they're less comfortable than the other ones I previously bought in the same size because of that.
4.0,"I bought these for a project in my son's class, and on the whole, they were a pretty good buy.  There were a couple that weren't the best quality (glued on crooked) and the clasps on top aren't top quality, but overall they looked great and I was able to use them all."
4.0,"Sturdy glasses, bifocal a little high on lens for me."
4.0,Nice for costume jewelry. Felt a little cheap but I would still probably wear with a nice outfit and no one would know the difference.
4.0,I purchased this beautiful pendant for my two sisters for Christmas. They arrived very nicely packaged in a black velveteen bag.  They are marked 925 and the pendant is very lovely.  I knew they were advertised as oxidized ans they are darker than a brilliant silver.  I'm sure they will be happy to receive this gift as it is a touching reminder of our friendship as sisters.
4.0,Love it! It's just the right size. I have one in white too!
4.0,They serve the purpose. Seem thinner than expected but like I said they fit and work.
4.0,I'm a size 12/14 and a D cup and the 2x fit pretty well. I wish the top was a little more sturdy as it tends to roll up/down some but overall I think it's a decent swimsuit for the price.
4.0,"Seems well made. Time will tell. I ordered a medium, runs a bit small. I have a 33 waist, looks like a large would have been a better choice."
4.0,Nice light weight for warmer months.
4.0,"It’s a nice quality t-shirt. Just the right length . I’m 5’1 ! Hard to find a shirt that’s fitted, but not skin tight and this shirt is just perfect!"
4.0,"This probably shouldn't have to be said, but please wash this on its own when you first receive it. I made the mistake of washing it with a few other items and they are now red, so do not make the same mistake as well. Also, this robe sheds like a husky the first few times that you wash/use it so I would suggest running it through the dryer 2x and changing the dryer lint halfway through.<br /><br />Other than shedding, this robe is extremely soft and so cozy. I am 5'4, 185lbs and I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. It is a longer robe which is great and it also had pockets on the front for a phone or whatever. I love how soft and cozy it is and it is perfect for after the shower if you want to stay warm."
4.0,"The swimsuit Looks great, but was too big, have to return it."
4.0,Good Product. Fits well and works well. Pricewise- there are similar things available at a lower price I guess (but maybe not with the HH proprietary technology etc that they market their products with).
4.0,"(Really it's more like 3.5 stars, but halvsies aren't an option.)<br />This bracelet has decent weight to it, and looks ALMOST as pictured. The stones are shown as a deep, rich red, but are actually washed out, making them look more dark-pinkish-red (yeah, that's a color - haha). Also, the clasp is very light and cheap -- not sure how long it will last. It's still a pretty bracelet, but it won't work for the outfit I had in mind.<br /><br />Item arrived much more quickly than Amazon predicted (thank goodness).<br /><br />Overall, this bracelet is well worth the price (come on, folks, what do you really expect for under $5?), just be aware that the color isn't going to be the same as pictured."
4.0,"So I had a crazy idea, buy bigger gloves to put over winter gloves! I needed a nice padded grip to walk my German Shepherd in the winter. These gloves are great, while they didn't work for my crazy idea they would be great for bicycling. I'd recommend them."
4.0,Good walking shoe
4.0,"Fit great, material a little thin"
4.0,Smaller than I expected & cubic zirconia are not as defined to the earring...stones are too small also.
4.0,Love them but the gold paint chips off really quickly. But you get what you pay for 😉
4.0,"This is a nice watch and perfect for what I need. But the one that came was not gold, it was rose gold. Still really pretty so I decided to keep it. Ended up buying a different gold watch, so just be advised that the color mai differ from that in the photo."
4.0,"Using these as thank you gifts for &#34;moms&#34; of the bride and groom. &#34;Thanks for helping us tie the knot&#34;<br />Pretty, good color, arrived earlier than expected. They are a little flimsy and will bend"
4.0,"I'd gotten the impression that these tops run really small, so I'd ordered Large ( I usually wear Small). The Large fits me like a Medium. For a true fit, you might want to order 1 size up, but you could probably get away with ordering whatever size you'd normally wear.<br />The top looks exactly as shown on the item page."
4.0,"It does run small, so go up a couple of sizes"
4.0,"My daughter is 5'3&#34;, 120 lbs, 34c bust. This dress fit and looks great! HOWEVER, the slip underneath is completely wrong. As in other reviews, it comes to just below mid-rear! It doesn't cover her rear-end. I did expect that because of previous reviews and pictures. We still ordered it knowing this because I can sew. I will remove it and replace with a lining that is long enough to cover everything! Plan to do this if you get this dress. Otherwise, very attractive dress."
4.0,"I just bought to use during a Christmas party. They are cute but I think the little bow is a bit smaller than I expected. Even so, they hang nicely and worked well with my outfit thst night. Will probably keep to have handy for other Christmases."
4.0,"I ordered these for my 5 year old granddaughter. Size 6x at Target (Cat and Jack) run a bit big on her, so I thought these should fit. They are too snug.  I would buy the next size up, if I buy these again."
4.0,"Took forever to get here, didn't pay attention to where it was coming from, but quality was fine."
4.0,It's a very good key holder good strong spring I'm buying a spare the price is right fits well on my belt
4.0,The material is soo thin and tight! giving away. go a size up!
4.0,The only thing about this robe that bothers me is that the ears are placed so far back on the hood that they might as well not be there. Other than that it's warm and soft and awesome. Should have gotten a size up but thats on me.
4.0,"I made this purchase prior to Christmas - though the product was fun - not all items worked, and the company worked to make sure I was completely satisfied with the purchase. That kind of service goes a long way in keeping my business."
4.0,I really need a petite size.  This was just too large overall for my body type.  I think it would work well for someone else.
4.0,I live the idea of lighted slippers since I do get up at night. When I first received slippers they were great. Now they have loosed or stretched and became hard to walk in. Feet slip out
4.0,Wife like this and is hard to buy for in this catigory.
4.0,they are very nice pants but i didn't think that the size ran as small as they do i ordered a size 36 turned out i needed a bigger size so i gave them to my step dad that's the only problem i have with the pants if you are going to buy these pants go up two sizes i wish i would have.
4.0,Beautiful but flimsy
4.0,"Bought it as a part of a Halloween costume. The idea is to be able to use it for Halloween and also casually so it doesn’t seem like spending a lot of money just for a costume.<br /><br />From all of the reviews, I was hoping the fabric would be a little thicker and better quality. Does not mean that the quality is bad, just so-so. At least it stretches enough to fit me even though the size seemed to be to small on the top which is ok. It is comfortable enough to wear everyday, just keep in mind that the fabric is thinner than it looks, T-shirt/legging-like fabric, so might not be good for cold days."
4.0,Sleeping jams
4.0,"It fits kinda big, I could've gone with a size L/12 I got a L/14 because L/12 was out of stock. But other than that, I love the design, and I love the ruffles in the front, definitely hides the mommy tummy!"
4.0,A little cheap but I expected that. Still cute though!
4.0,It was hard to find a dress for my robot loving friend. The sewing on the dress is simple and the fabric was soft. There was a slight difference in color of the sleeve and the main section of the dress.
4.0,"Purchased these for my kids to carry to Disney to trade with cast members.  Was a little disappointed that I did have duplicates, but my kids just traded with each other first."
4.0,I like the pants set. I like the material and the pattern of the pants. They are comfortable outfit. I like the fact that it has some stretch to it.my boyfriend loveS it:
4.0,"bought this for a family member, does as expected"
4.0,I purchase two of these gowns last year and my  granddaughter loved them.  I purchased another this year and she feels the same.  Will probably purchase 2 more next year.
4.0,I really like this shirt. The cut may be a little funny but over all it's a good shirt. This shirt is NOT chevron like I thought per the picture. It's more of a silk/night gown/ stretchy material. Does show everything so I would wear spanks and a tank top underneath if you get a skin tight one like I did.<br /><br />size 2XL 5'7 240lbs.
4.0,I tried three or four different brands and this was my favorite. Most of them were a little too long for my legs so they would cut off the circulation at my ankles these are just the right length feel great on my legs and do the job. And the colors are fun
4.0,i love it its pretty. its just really big on me -.- . sizes dont run small they run just about normal
4.0,I love this except it wrinkles badly.
4.0,Works very well but it was packaged such that there are permanent folds on it.  It needs top be packed completely flat.
4.0,Cute bows
4.0,"I like the quality of the fabric this sweatshirt is made of.<br />However, I purchased mine in a larger size so that it would be looser on me. I normally by mediums- and they fit well- but I bought a large. This large felt more like a medium. The sleeve fit right to my arms, and the hood fit small.<br />I'd say this fits smaller than you'd expect. If you want a looser one, buy two sizes up."
4.0,Perfect for your babygirl
4.0,Very cute dress for price
4.0,Love these glasses!! I'm always misplacing my glasses and to have a couple of back ups at home and office is great. The vision is consistent and the quality is great
4.0,A little short for me but it will be perfect for the beach and around the pool. Fits as expected otherwise.
4.0,"Size up, it was too small I had to return it but it was really cute and good quality."
4.0,"Teh gold of the frames are not as light as pictured, but more of a true gold (which of course is a good thing). These fit perfectly. The legs of the frames round out around the sides of your face but become snug by the ears, making them sturdy and comfortable. The ends of the legs are pointed and sturdy so they scrap a little when putting them on and taking them off. Also, the legs are really skinny so I'm sure that if you accidently step on sit on them that they will not make it. The rest of the sunglasses are very sturdy though. They are tinted and provide protection from the sun. They also come with a reusable leather-like case."
4.0,Very warm and some tummy control. Cannot be worn out without a tunic or something long or over it because you can see through it a bit. I wear it around the house and under jeans. Ordered a medium and fits great.
4.0,Doesn't turn everything you look at completely purple. But still looks cool.
4.0,Size up and the dress is great! I love the material and the fit it perfect! Wish it came in more options. Would definitely buy again!
4.0,Its okay. Gave as gift
4.0,"This EONFUN Turquoise Necklace is rather nice. The chain wasn't great however, but, the ornament like I said is rather pretty."
4.0,"Fits well, looks nice. I only gave it 4 stars because I expected the fabric to be heavier. Reviews said it was a lightweight denim but it is a polyester knit. However, it is not see- through and should be great for the hot summer days in Florida.  The adjustable buttons are a plus as I am short in the torso and wear a petite when I can find it."
4.0,Very nice quality. beautiful color
4.0,"Good sale, arrived quickly."
4.0,"EXACTLY AS THE PICTURE.<br />YOU HAVE TO TIE IT WITH A CORD. THATS WHAT I DIDNT LIKE MUCH BT MY HAIR WAS DOWN AND COULDNT SEE IT. OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS BEAUTIFUL."
4.0,"have no Idea what it is like, My Grand daughter age 4 likes it"
4.0,"Quality of jacket and hat is good, gloves are pretty flimsy. Jacket fits small. Ordered 120 for my 7 yo, grade 2 son who is small-average size and it was tight. Return policy excellent"
4.0,I ordered an XL and received a L but it fit perfectly so no issues.
4.0,Glasses frame is a lot darker than pictured.  Fits perfectly over my regular glasses.  Light weight and comfortable.
4.0,"These are probably fine for most people, but I have them on a small sized women's boot. They work, but are a bit large. Would recommend."
4.0,"I liked the fact that the hat looks good, even though it's not the original design from the TV show Enterprise. What I liked the least was it has a small nick on the bill of the hat in front. Not very noticible, but there. The packaging of the hat was great."
4.0,The choker is fine. It looks very nice and fits the online description
4.0,Doesn't work effectively on all fabrics. Takes some practice to apply in a flattering way.
4.0,Very comfortable! Love them! The only thing I think they should change is the waist button is a snap button... not good for a larger guy. Need a belt to keep snapped.
4.0,Very nice and warm but sometimes slips off the ears a little too easily.<br />I wish it were tighter.
4.0,"like the look of these, but this is the second one I had to buy because the first one broke. It lasted a couple years though so I'm not salty or anything. Just wish the gold clipping part with the spring was tougher."
4.0,"These bracelets are superrrr fashionable, and I LOVE them! For some reason they sent me two, so I gave it to my bestfriend. Only problem is the chains are very fragile and break easily. Luckily my mom is a jeweler 😂"
4.0,Quick drying but somewhat small in size
4.0,I love it  it's very cute a refreshing punch  to your summer outfits
4.0,Ran big on our daughter. No problem will keep it until she grows into it. Cost is great for a quality gi when kids grow fast!
4.0,"The ad title is very misleading. If you have a nickel allergy DO NOT BUY. They're not 925 silver and definitely not 14k gold. It's just gold color plated nickel. The stones are not CZ, but just cut glass. But they sure do sparkle! I like sparkly things, even if they're made with cheap materials. For $8, I could have spent the same at Claire's in the mall anyway so I'm not complaining."
4.0,I'm 5'1' and 115lbs and the small fits wonderfully. A little baggy on me but its a jumpsuit so I actually prefer it like that. Very comfortable fabric. A little see-through up top but nothing a tanktop underneath won't fix. Has built in shorts liner for the bottom so only slightly see through from knee down.
4.0,"It was great for the base of my poison ivy costume, but I wouldn’t wear it without adding all the leaves I did. It’s very high cut on the butt and extremely low on the bust. It snaps in the crotch. I hadn’t expected that. I had to change the lacing. It freed a bit and wouldn’t maintain size because it stretches a lot. I had to add boning in the back so it would stay up. It’s nice that the bust has padding."
4.0,"I was skeptical at first. Its a large tote. The bag inside can be used as a smaller purse. Overall this purse works for what I need it for. I'm able to carry a 8 inch tablet, stethascope, book, wallet and all my needed belongings. I bought 2 so I can use it year round."
4.0,"The necklace is actually a lot nicer quality than I thought it would be. Mine came nicely wrapped and is made of a much heavier material than I imagined. The shade was a bit darker than I hoped, more red than coral, but I am still pleased."
4.0,"Good length but a bit too skinny. I don't mind tapered jeans but don't like having to struggle to get my foot into a leg...that is the case with these. Once over the feet, these are okay since there is some stretch but not my favorite pair. In fact, these are annoying skinny. Good denim and true to size at waist and length."
4.0,"It’s very pretty, just much darker than pictured. That’s the only reason why I’m sending it back."
4.0,"I love this scarf. It's very warm, and the pattern is nice. The only bad thing I have to say is that it does pull quite easily. The first time I wore it, I got a very obvious pull in it. I'm going to try to fix it because I really like it overall, but just be aware that you might need to be a little gentle with this scarf."
4.0,"Good quality, can't beat the price.  Overall great value for the money."
4.0,Luv em
4.0,This shirt is so comfortable!  I ordered a size up from what I normally wear (I ordered a 4x) and I'm glad that I did.
4.0,"Love the color, style, and fabric, but this dress doesn’t stretch at the waist and was uncomfortable to wear. I sent it back for a larger size."
4.0,Awesome party dress
4.0,"These are great glasses for those of you who are like me and go through glasses like Kleenex, from either loosing them or accidentally messing them up.  The overall construction of the glasses is nicely done and the lenses came in without a scratch.  The glasses themselves seem like they might bend out of shape somewhat easily due to their style.  I would say these would be better on people who have larger heads.  I have an issue with them being a bit loose on me and I don't have a small head.  The price is nice for what you get."
4.0,Good shoes for beginner youth players
4.0,Love the neon colors! Learning 2 tie & wrap new looks
4.0,A liiittle small in the fingers but very very cute and warm
4.0,"I was shocked that I liked this on as much as I did.  I am short (5'2&#34;) and cannot ever buy clothing online, so I was glad it fit"
4.0,"Love these hats, this style run very small. Definitely did not fit my 3 year old!"
4.0,"Looks nice, but very small and not the greatest materials.  I'm thinking it'll last for at least a few years because the person I purchased this for is -very- careful with all her things."
4.0,"Ordered these because they were the style I was looking for, and in that respect, they delivered perfectly.  The magnification/lenses are good quality and non-distorted.<br />On the plus side, these glasses are very light.  On the downside, they are almost too lightweight; the arms don't do a good job of holding the glasses on over my ears & tend to slide off the bridge of my nose as soon as I look down or bend over.  There was almost no adjustability in the nose pads to spread them out, so in the end, these are good looking glasses but you have to remain very still when using them or else they slide around & fall off."
4.0,"My husband could squeeze just barely into this hat, though it was fine on me.  Quality is great, just watch the size"
4.0,I ordered a small and medium and returned the medium. Soft t shirt. I like the color and the picture. Just a fun shirt to wear with jeans.
4.0,"Great for shower shoes/house shoes/labor & delivery<br />Flimsy, so I don’t wear them out of the house much. I had the same issue as other reviewers with the front portion folding under while walking."
4.0,These are soft and useful when thicker gloves are not needed. They are thinner than some so be careful when applying.
4.0,"I love this ski mask, it keeps the wind and snow out of my face, it is great!"
4.0,It was a little big for my 8 year old. But it's really nice and has a silky texture to it.
4.0,"Item is fairly nicely made, but instead of uniform bending around the mask so it forms to the face, it has straight bends which makes it uncomfortable. The metal is soft, so i can reform it, but an unnecessary thing to have to do. I had bought one other for a tad bit more cost and quicker shipping from a different vendor, and it was perfect."
4.0,I preferred the earlier versions off these but they're still OK.  For whatever reason the new cut is more wedgy prone.
4.0,These are a nice size - but not too big! Also a good color selection and price for 5 pairs!
4.0,"It's a lot paler than the photos online show, but it's still a pretty color. It does wrinkle easily but the wrinkles steamed away easily."
4.0,"I've been trying to find a pair of winter boots like these in an extra wide width for years and would have been happy with anything that fit. These boots did that; I wear a 7 1/2 EEE and the 7 1/2 boots fit well. In addition, the quality seems pretty good. They have good traction on ice and the uppers are flexible and comfortable. I found the insoles uncomfortable but they were easy to replace. I don't wear these a lot so I can't really comment on how well they hold up."
4.0,"This dress is better than I expected.  I ordered the grey in small and it fit perfectly.  My measurements are 34D, 27, 37. I love that it's tea length underneath and sheer the rest of the way."
4.0,"The sewing is well done, flat seams.  The material is soft.<br /><br />Holding it back from 5 stars- I got black and it attracts and shows everything- lint, dust, pet hair.  The collar is baggy, but I think if were tighter it would look too ""priest-like"".  There is JUST enough body that the collar stays mostly up, but is somewhat slouchy.  The biggest negative is the zipper.  It doesn't slide smoothly always and the end (tail) is untacked and about an inch and a half long inside the shirt and it curls.  The zipper also causes rippling... more waves or if smoothed a bulge... of the fabric on the chest."
4.0,Its nice....a little hard to reach the clips in back but probably because my reach not there yet.  Its is does hold everything in place as its supposed to at &#34;Maximim.&#34;
4.0,They've held up well enough.<br />Works with my CCW IWB holsters.<br />Have to retighten a little to often.<br />Good enough that I have recomended them.
4.0,"Recently, I purchased a set of these for my adult sister. She seems pleased with them. Today, she text me to say she was headed to the gym wearing the earrings. I saw them in person before mailing them to her. I noticed they are small, however; when a lady is active she may desire the smaller size earrings."
4.0,"This gloves are nice and thick. They work well with my phone. My only complaint is that they are a bit small. My hands aren’t huge, but my fingers aren’t short. I’m 5’ 9”, so not crazy tall, but a little taller than average. I wish they came in a larger size. I’m keeping them though because they will work."
4.0,It’s gorgeous! Exactly what it said it was and is perfect. Many compliments!
4.0,This bag was larger than i expected but i love the sturdiness and material. It fits lots of stuff but that's just too much weight when I'm looking cute.
4.0,"Very cute, but too small.  I ordered a large- I'm 5'9&#34;  143 lbs and it was a bit too tight. I could snap it, but it puckered a bit. Snap front is nice. A bit more flare to the skirt than the picture shows."
4.0,"Fit was spot on and it looks good, even the nerds at Comic con liked it"
4.0,Comfortable and soft. Let’s see how it feels after washing
4.0,"Size ordered: XS<br />Measurements: 5'2&#34; tall, 32DDD bust, size 0-2 pants, size S/M in tops<br /><br />I knew this dress was supposed to have a flowy/loose look before ordering, so I ordered an XS because I'm so short and I didn't want it to look like a potato sack on me. I'm very pleased with the quality of this garment and the color is a very prettty deep red just like the photos. I like the elastic arm bands around the upper arm and wrist so I can shorten the sleeves if desired and it makes the sleeves not so baggy looking, however I felt the length of the sleeves for an XS were too long and they went past my fingertips, while the shirt itself seemed short in the front and back.<br /><br />Overall I liked this shirt/dress, but I felt for an XS it should have been a little smaller; it is more suited for taller people in the torso/waist, but shorter people in the length."
4.0,5 pairs of Merino wool socks. These are so comfortable and cozy. They keep my feet warm at night and are long so they go up my legs. They are big on me especially in the foot area. I wear a size 7.5 in womens. Good wool socks that are great for winter time.  Love the colors and the 5 pack. Quality made socks.
4.0,"I made the mistake of ordering this in dry season, so I've had to improvise my testing.<br /><br />Black poncho with hearts on it. Light weight, and folds down to a small size, and fits into a provided pouch. Pouch has a carabiner clip on it. Hooded, with zippers and snaps to hold the hood in place.  Only concern is that the length of the poncho is such that the ""sleeves"" only cover to about midway between wrist and elbow.<br /><br />Now for the fun bit - I tested how waterproof it was by turning on the shower and holding it up to the spray for a couple of minutes. It did not soak through. Dried within a few hours."
4.0,"This thing is basically what you expect to get. It fits well and is nice support. I am 5'9&#34; and 140lbs and I got a small. The color is the same - pretty bright and saturated. There are little pockets that are accessible if you want to take out the pads for any reason. The only awkward thing is how small the pads are. You can kind of see the outline of those when you are wearing the bra. All in all, good product for the price."
4.0,To early not cold enough<br />To see how it does
4.0,"Son dislikes the print on the back, but likes the color"
4.0,Cute dress..true to size. Bought the green. The colors are nowhere  near the vibrance  depicted  on sellers  pic. I guess I'll  keep🙄
4.0,"It's not the same color blue depicted in the picture. This is more of a blue heather. This is an XL and it's a bit snug. Nonetheless, I like the message. The material is nice too."
4.0,"The blush is a perfect color for summer.  The closure worked very well, I was hesitant about it.  I am always a 6.5-7 and got these in a 7. I wish they had 6.5 because I would exchange them in a heartbeat. The toe section at the top was a little long and going down the half size probably would have helped."
4.0,Super soft and flattering. I'm 200 lbs and got a large.. and it has pockets!!
4.0,Keeps my legs and feet warm and I love the silver stitching but does not fit well in most of my flats (Rothy’s) takes some work to hide the black from peeking out
4.0,Nice key chain however arrived with a broken stem. Still nice and happy to have.
4.0,"Comfy, but if you have a bigger bust, the bust runs tight! I'm only a b/c and the 2X is tight on me."
4.0,These are cute. Bought the xl. A little snug but cute. They run small. Just enough stretch
4.0,"Good for travel. Interior zippers stuck a little, but worked fine."
4.0,"I love this necklace! Design is 10/10, quality of the metal 10/10<br />However, the reason there is a star taken off, is that I am about to buy a second one of these. I wear it 24/7 in the shower, to bed, etc, and after a while the string that loops under the hole on the pendant, wears thin, until it eventually breaks. If it did not have this issue it would be all 5 Stars. I would recommend getting some kind of metal chain for it, that is my plan."
4.0,"Fits ok, a bit too long cuz I'm short but the fit is nice"
4.0,Very nice little bit darker than picture but it’s pretty
4.0,"The ring is really cute don’t get me wrong. But kinda small, for sure on the smaller side. And it is kinda dirty around the smiley face part of the ring, but for $10 it’s not bad."
4.0,"Good product, would purchase again."
4.0,"Tired and achy legs from standing on concrete have definitely been a problem for years.  These simple compression sleeves truly help!  The multi movement sleeves help the veins return blood and minimize swelling and discomfort.<br /><br />I wear them when driving, hiking, standing or sitting for long periods.  I know they are mostly promoted for exercise but they really work well for aiding with blood return for those that have abused their legs for years.  Hospital workers, security personnel, retail workers, drivers, and anyone else that spends too many hours either seated or standing.<br /><br />Give your legs some support and feel great at the end of your day."
4.0,Bought both colors for my twin boys...love the fit and look!!!!!
4.0,Really cute and light weight. Size up if you want it loose! I normally wear a medium but really glad I got a large!
4.0,"As expected, working well"
4.0,It is so soft! The blue was brighter than pictured but it is beautiful. Buying more! 💗
4.0,Very cute! We’re a little small on my baby
4.0,Received quickly and as advertised
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter to wear to a wedding, in the middle of the hot Midwest summer. She was comfortable and it looked adorable!  The only downside was that it wrinkled very easily"
4.0,"This is a cool and fun watch. I just needed something bright and big for reading purposes, the watch just did."
4.0,This will help my dance shoes that are narrow and too tight.<br />Very understanding and thoughtful people.<br />Looking forward to future products.
4.0,"They r really nice , got the xxl<br />I usually wear a 16 , they do fit me but<br />Be happy when I lose 10 more lbs"
4.0,Cute & cuddly.
4.0,i really liked the style of the bracelet and most of all the price<br />i would order again if there is something different in silver
4.0,"This looks like a denim shirt but it is a much softer chambray. Everything is well tailored with double seam stitching, most of which is in a contrasting white thread.<br />The contrast stitching is more pronounced in person, which as another reviewer said gives this a strong country/western vibe.<br />It is very comfortable to wear, seems true to size and launders well.<br />Even though it looks like one, this is not a denim work shirt but it works for casual weekend wear."
4.0,I wear them when outside shoveling or operating a skid steer. Typically my hands would get cold after a few hours of doing these type of activities but the zero gloves kept my hands dry and warm the entire time.
4.0,"This IS adorable and I love the color, HOWEVER, I took one star off because of the material, its form fitting. I usually wear a medium, but since this has spandex (in it which makes you look fatter in MY opinion 😑) I had to exchange it to a large and its STILL clingy! Do chinese people make ANYTHING without goddam spandex??😫<br />Anyhoo, If I got the extra large, I would then be wearing clown 🤡 pants! I'll just keep it and maybe with a few good washings, it won't look like I'm stuffed in a colorful spanx whole body girdle. 😖<br />If you liked this review, click ""helpful""<br />Thanls"
4.0,"These are just what I wanted for around the house/ relaxing.  They're short like bootie shorts and I do wish they were a tiny bit higher waisted but sit at my belly button/ natural waist so they're fine! Fit true to size, good stretch, stay in place and the waist doesn't roll down! Very comfortable! Great for around the house or swimming!"
4.0,I actually like these. They're a little cheap but they're cheap necklaces.
4.0,Awesome sunglasses. They are a little heavier than normal sunglasses. You do have to get use to the pinkish tint it gives when wearing them.
4.0,My daughter loves these earrings but they are not anti allergic so can not use it for a long period of time
4.0,It’s a great winter cap and keeps very warm but I ordered size 2-4 for my toddler who is 2 and average built and it just fit her. I don’t think it will last her till she is 4 and she has a standard sized head. So it runs a little snug. Size up when you buy. It’s a good cap to have. Covers the sides perfectly.
4.0,Beautiful piece although a little delicate.
4.0,Everything is great.  The only part that does not go with the set at all is the earrings.  But the dress is a great fit.  Just wish it came with hose too!
4.0,"If you are looking for something tight that can hold you down, I'd either get something else or size down because the material is thin. Great for working out if you don't want sweat to stick around but overall if you are looking for compression gear the material (although very nice) wouldn't hold you together if you know what I mean. I'm 5'6 and 230 lbs. I got a medium."
4.0,Overall great product.  I had problems with one piece of the all thread that connects the two halves together and had to chase the threads with a tap/dye.
4.0,Nice earrings just wish they came with backs to stay in ear
4.0,The shoes are definitely super cute they are a bit more on the feminine side for a little boy to be wearing but nonetheless they have a rockstar look to them and they're a little big but my child will grow into them and really seems to like the shiny star
4.0,"they ride up a bit, but they're comfortable and look great"
4.0,I do wish the dress was more full like in the picture but over all it’s good and the wig is pretty good quality
4.0,Long fit. Great for those seeking length for longer legs. Great pockets.
4.0,"Good quality. The only complaint is that the bill of the hat is  a bit too long, making it a little weird  if you have a small head. Still wearable"
4.0,Measured per guideline and were big
4.0,Overall I'm pretty impressed with how warm these keep for feet. But be careful! I think they are only waterproof past the rubber part. I walked through a puddle and my feet got pretty wet.
4.0,This sun visor is great.  Had a tiny issue with removing the some sections of the film because it’s sewn in with the seam but I was able to clean it up with tweezers.  The shade cover is adjustable and can be moved up or down.  It’s fairly large so you get good coverage.  This is great for protecting your face when working in the sun.  I wear this while gardening and working around the house. I would feel a little silly if I wore this out in public due to the size.
4.0,"I just received these and love the way they look and feel!  I own several pair of Lularoe leggings ( which I adore) and war pleasantly surprised to discover these are similar to T&C in fit and are just as stretchy and buttery soft!  I haven't washed them yet so the jury is still out on durability, but so far I'm very happy with this purchase!I just received these and love the way they look and feel!  I own several pair of Lularoe leggings ( which I adore) and was pleasantly surprised to discover these are just as stretchy and buttery soft!

4.0,The compression is good but the sizing is off.  I bought these for my husband but cannot get them over his foot.  They fit me.  They were large-extra large.
4.0,"Fits nicely, cute outfit. My only negative is that the design looks a bit different in person."
4.0,"no irritation, great size .. unfortunately one of them didn't stay clicked shut and I lost it in the pool. Otherwise I liked these alot and felt classy in them."
4.0,This chain looks like the picture. My son loves it. It looks good. Does not look cheap or fake. It is the chain and the dragon pendant.
4.0,Bought a 2x and don't normally wear that size but glad I did bc it fit perfect. DO NOT DRY IT!!
4.0,"For the price of these rings, I will purchase again in the future. I bought my husband these as a Christmas gift because it feels as though we were purchasing the name brand ones too frequently and their cost adds up quickly!<br />These have lasted the same amount of time for a fraction of he price."
4.0,"Fit as expected, not the best material, but excellent relationship between the cost."
4.0,"Excellent for the price! I wear them around the house mostly, I wore them to work one day and got a lot of compliments, so that was nice :)"
4.0,"Fits to size, however unable to determine the front of the blouse from the back. Otherwise very pleased"
4.0,They felt nice but way too big and I didn't feel like trying another size so I only returned them.
4.0,Good product.  Lengthy delivery time.
4.0,Omg! I love this piece I like how it looks on me its a bit short from the back but it's a beach attire so I don't mind it at all :) I gave it a 4 star because I need to lose a few lbs (which I'm working on lol) for it to look perfect 😍 can't wait for my trip to Cancun! For reference I'm 5'3 and weigh about 185
4.0,Overall well made. The tag that is sown on broke fairly easily. They are very think and definitely keep my little ears warm!
4.0,These are really nice except the nose pieces that hold it in place are a little loose and wobbly.
4.0,Great dress very flowy in the belly I wore it while pregnant and not pregnant  I got a lot of complaints very comfortable...material is a little shinny fit great. I am 5'5&#34; very busty and wore flats it just got the floor
4.0,LOVED this but it broke a year later.
4.0,They last for long time looking like new for as long as you clean them after few days of use.
4.0,"I bought these a half size down, as advised.  They fit well and look nice on the foot.  A bargain."
4.0,Expected rough edges for the price. Was pleasantly surprised that they were evenly stained and smooth.
4.0,Material was ok but color was off from picture.  That was not the problem it was the to didn’t fit a “ D” cup
4.0,Runs a little small but a beautiful dress for the stage. I ordered a size 12 for my daughter and it fit just a little tight on top but definitely looked like a more expensive lyrical costume.
4.0,"Very nice...<br /><br />But just to clarify, the print will probably be more faded than you can tell on a screen.<br /><br />It also is a bit larger than most shirts are.<br />So my advice would be checking the measurement table and probably going down a size.<br /><br />I usually wear a large, but I ordered the medium and it fit like my usual large shirts do."
4.0,great top. great for work and obviously casual wear too. I got a large and normally wear a large but a medium may fit better. but I was happy with the loose fit anyway .
4.0,"Nice looking shirt.  True to size.  My husband is 5' 10"" and 205lbs.  He typically wears an XL in shirts and this fit perfect.  The colors are nice and material hangs well but is a slight bit rough.  I am hoping after a few washes it will soften up.  It's not so rough that it's uncomforable, especially since my husband wears a t-shirt under his polos, but it's definitely not super soft to the touch.  Overall not a bad shirt."
4.0,Ordered for sister.
4.0,"Pants came with a greener tint than pictured but otherwise there perfect, fit better than I expected."
4.0,Love design and the lens is clear with blue tint for computer use. A bit too big for my face but I like the look and I get alot of compliments!
4.0,It was a bit tight around waist. Ending up returning it. But cute dress. Said I should be a large.
4.0,Cheap but very serviceable. Perfect for a wedding or formal event. Not for everyday wear.
4.0,It's shorter than I thought.  My lil one will have to wear shorts with this. But it is cute
4.0,Nice quality. Fit the description. Just a little small.
4.0,It was a fun gift but it broke pretty fast
4.0,Cute leggings. As described
4.0,Very nice but it does shrink a little in the wash.
4.0,This is perfect for summer....in expensive but cool......fun
4.0,This product is for Halloween and cosplay to wear at conventions. Pretty decent quality especially for price not sure you'll find better anywhere else unless you make it yourself.
4.0,This is a good quality leotard. My daughter loves the skirt part. The only thing I don't love is that the pink color I bought her is a little see through because it's a light pink.
4.0,"Nice dress, soft lace (not itchy). Slightly small which worked out well for us since I had to buy a size bigger. I wish the under layer were a tad longer but overall am pleased."
4.0,It's cute a little small so when it's doubled its tighter to your neck but adorable great spring color.
4.0,A little too loose fitting for me around the mid section.  Im usually a large (or extra large if very fitted).  These in large loose on me.
4.0,"I would have given these super cute and comfortable boots 5 stars, but they have a very strong smell of rubber. I just got them a few days ago so I’m hoping that goes away quickly. Other then that they are perfect!"
4.0,Was a little darker than expected but overall very pleased!
4.0,I liked the product. It really is a slim card holder.
4.0,"I love this gaitor, the ability to tighten it is very useful ad these things tend to stretch over time. All in all very satisfied. The only downfall was that  I was planning to use it at work, my employer had a problem with the logo being so visible, so i can only use it for personal use, so hopefully I can find one with no visible logos."
4.0,"After purchasing the pink one and loving it, I bought this blue one to stash for last minute gift giving. Can't beat the price, so easy  on my wallet."
4.0,"It fit me well enough that I can wear it and feel comfortable, but it was a bit loose in the bust region.  Like I said, it still fits well enough that it looks great on me when I adjust it properly.  The color is absolutely wonderful and spot on to what I expected.  Very pleased with the product.  I will warn you that the floral pattern was larger than I expected, but looks really nice.  I can't wait to wear this when I walk across the stage at graduation."
4.0,"Ordered this to hold up my tactical long shorts - for summer yard work.  The belt looks great, and it certainly holds the pants up.  That being said, the locking mechanism gets worn and weak within a month.  The best still works, but I will tell you that every once in awhile, it will pop open.  Not TOO big of a deal, as your pants won't immediately fall, but you can absolutely HEAR it when it pops open.  lol.  Everyone within earshot knows that your belt just gave way, and the jokes then ensue.  Sigh.  Ah well.  Recommended, but I have to think that there is a better version of this type of belt out there."
4.0,"Exactly what I have been looking for for months!  I LOVE it/Them I got black and also red. I normally wear 42 DD.I ordered 40D. I wanted push IN, not up and it's great. So yes, size up one or more but keep in mind they come with a 2 inch extension of 5 hooks for the back. Very Sturdy, and Pretty. I'm going to order some other colors next month!<br />[Women's Extreme Support Push Up Bra Brassiere...]]"
4.0,Its a soft fabric. My only concern was about an inch shrinkage in length on first laundering. Otherwise pleased.
4.0,I loved this tail! Too much fun! Wish it would have been a little longer but I’m pretty tall so I just sewed some extra fabric to the bottom and it was perfect!
4.0,"These socks are nice and light.  However, they do not hold their form on my size 13 feet for all day use.  I have to keep pulling them up!  If you need socks for sleeping, they are great."
4.0,My favorite gown this winter
4.0,"Very soft fabric and comfortable...especially if you like sexy and dressy.  It was low cut, especially in the back so I opened the neckline seam and ran narrow elastic around the neck which helped a great deal.  I got many compliments when I wore it."
4.0,"The overall quality of this hat is amazing. The range, however, is not that great. The 33 foot range seems to have an actual range of 15 feet. If you plan to take this to the gym, keep your phone with you. Also, if you listen long enough, there is a rattling noise with music in the right speaker. Sometimes the beanie also has a hard time syncing with my Note 5, but sometimes it connects right away. However, for the price this is a steal."
4.0,They fit perfectly well. I like it very much.
4.0,I love it. Fits well and im 5ft11.
4.0,"Nice dress, material is too thin though."
4.0,"Beware this product does size down, so if you're looking for a big comfy jacket size up one or two sizes. Other than that the bomber  looks fantastic and I've gotten many compliments."
4.0,Cool shirt go up a size if u don't want that squeeze tho.
4.0,"This ear cuff does not go through your ear, but over and around it. CUTE dragon! Smaller shape can be reshaped. Arrived with the cuff portion bent and almost broken, so a four-star rating. If you are willing to take a chance that the cuff ring may break when you reshape it to your ear, then take a chance on getting this one. I figured it would be great decoration for a pencil cup or lamp shade if I couldn't bend it enough. Good luck!"
4.0,Simply beautiful! Chain clasp is a little hard to open. But the key is absolutely stunning
4.0,"Great suit.  Ordered it in white.  Be aware that it is sheet when wet.  The front has double fabric, so it's not a problem but the back will definitely show your &#34;ass&#34;ets."
4.0,Very comfortable to wear. A tad longer than I wanted.
4.0,"Its size is great. Fits my fat gut just fine without it hugging me. My main problem is that the shirt I received is not the color that I ordered. I expected a blue shirt like pictured but I go a black shirt instead, which leads me to believe that this is a counterfeit product."
4.0,Quite serviceable.
4.0,"This is a cute little necklace.  Customer service was great as I needed to return my first necklace as it was a ""b"" and another necklace, ""a"", was sent immediately."
4.0,"After wearing to one yoga session for an hour and half, I noticed that the material in the armpits looks thin, like it may rip.  I am worried about that."
4.0,"Paired it with a red puffer vest and some leopard leggings for total cuteness! Material is lightweight and flexible, washes well and doesnt pill. But the hood string is weird thick and extra long like a jump rope."
4.0,Its a little smaller than I thought but it still pretty much cool.
4.0,"There is a bit too much fabric to hide under my dress shoes, but it's great on hot days as a sock substitute.  It doesn't fall off and there is a little padding under the ball of the foot."
4.0,I was so happy when I saw the refreshing look and colors of the dress.  The only thing that surprised me was the material is heavier than expected.  But it’s a keeper.❤️
4.0,I love the style and fit! It is very flattering on. The top is very stretchy. I ordered a large and wear a 36D. I wish the color was more true to the description and pictures shown.<br />I ordered the dusty blue and it's purple in person. I gave it 4/5 stars because of the color.
4.0,"There's nothing plain & ordinary about this cute, comfy, casual lightweight top."
4.0,Good hat for beach
4.0,"Good summer sock. Comfortable texture and proper foot ventilation, and they stay on my feet with all my different sneakers. I like the color variety. I will buy more."
4.0,Great quality. Great costume. I got the right size for my neice but the arm and leg bands were too small for her to get her feet and hands through them. Still very pleased
4.0,Chain is to small but the quality of the bullet made up for it
4.0,Gift for my granddaughter. Size chart was great. Granddaughter loved the t shirt
4.0,Sooo cute. But the sizes run big!
4.0,"The purchase of my Brahmin handbag, shoulder strap broke after carry it only twice. So I’m not able to use the strap anymore I have to carry it by hand. But the purse itself is fine, I’m satisfied with it, a little smaller than I thought."
4.0,Fishing and work
4.0,Simply ...<br />SPECTACULAR !!<br />excellent product
4.0,"These are great quality. My only complaint, they feel and look smaller than 20mm.! So they keep sliding out, otherwise they’re great"
4.0,"I liked the look and fit of the shoes (they were very easy to put on over any type of shoe, from skinny high tops to bulky Ugg boots), but the material is not very durable (at least not for hiking, which is how I had planned to use them—they tore after just one short trip through the woods). However, I think these shoe covers would be great for, say, protecting your shoes during a rainy football game or crossing a flooded street, which is why I’m still giving them a high rating."
4.0,"Would have liked a little roomier, and the fact that it didn't hold heavier items was disappointing, but the bag was well made and lightweight."
4.0,They were a little tight for a size 9 foot....but worth the purchase.
4.0,This dress is exactly like the picture ! I really like it
4.0,They get the job done for Miraflex. Pretty tough to put in tho.
4.0,"I love these! I was worried when they arrived, they seemed a bit plastic, but they fit great and are super cute. Once washed the plastic feel went away. I got tons of compliments, even from people who don’t know the show and just thought they were cute tights. I’m 5’7” about 145 lbs and the m/l are perfect. They lose one star for the color - the blue is much lighter than any other TARDIS item I have. They didn’t go well with my dress so I ended up wearing them with a regular skirt and sweater."
4.0,The boot is pretty cool.  The tip of toe feels weird as if I should have went up 1/2 size.  Too scare to send back
4.0,The thong is too small for my hips (unflattering/make me bulge) but the top is so cute I just wear it with a different bottom. Sexy without being too revealing. Good quality.
4.0,Love this top! There were some loose strands on the rose when I received it but nothing that couldn't be trimmed.
4.0,Order a small and it comes just past my knees. Wish it was a little shorter but if your tall it will be perfect
4.0,They are perfect :3
4.0,These socks are a little tight but they do the job.  I hope they will be cool in summer.
4.0,"i really like this handbag, it's the perfect size and I love the lining, it looks so luxurious."
4.0,Wearing this thing feels like getting a warm hug.  Its awesome especially for the price.  My only complaint is it's really tight in the shoulders and arms
4.0,"Well fitted suit, minor tailoring to be done."
4.0,Good price. Thanks
4.0,A bit shear fabric
4.0,"A bargain for the summer, I wish you carry more color choices"
4.0,These socks are adorable. They are a little bit tight but not too bad.
4.0,The fit is great. Its a beautiful print. Dress style is leaner then the average roomy maxi dress which makes me look slimmer. Very soft but polyester material. Keep in mind it might be hot in the sun.
4.0,"The medium fits like an XL. Material is comfortable, is cute on in the right size"
4.0,Theses are great quality.  They stay in well and look nice with pretty much every outfit. They are comfortable enough I can sleep in them. My only problem was they take a lot of effort to put in.  They are definitely for someone who wants to put in earrings and leave them in for a while.
4.0,"Cute pants, a good deal for the price. Light material, and I was surprised to see the quality for the price."
4.0,"I'm happy with the fit and durability of these gloves, the only thing I have a problem with is the color. I thought they were going to be like a blue-camo, but upon arrival they are green-camo. Not a big deal, and for this price am not sending back. Overall happy, just not with the color."
4.0,This dress is so cute and fit true to size. Hits right at the knee and has a beautiful flowing look. I look off a star because the zipper keeps getting stuck but still a great piece at a great price
4.0,"Bought this for a trip to Florida as a beach cover up even though there were no reviews. I’m usually a large but sized up to an XL because I had no idea how this would actually fit, but I’m glad I did. The material is not stretchy, sort of thin and wrinkles easy. But I’m still pleasantly surprised! It’s flows really nicely and the design is just as cute as the photos. Since the material is stiff, I’d recommend a size up to ensure it fits nice and flows. I got the lavender color and it looks super cute with a tan. Excited to wear it to the beach!"
4.0,"I liked this, was hoping it fit but was too small."
4.0,I put it on and the neck wouldn’t lay flat. The length didn’t seem as long as I expected so I returned it.
4.0,"I’m a 6ft 167~lb guy, not a “jacked” build. I wear a medium in every other shirt I own/would buy, I bought a medium in these. The length is fine, the waist fit is loose but it doesn’t hang that much, it does feel breathable and looks alright. The side cuts don’t show much, and my nipples aren’t about to pop out. Your results may vary though if you’re jacked and go for a smaller size then like an “average” fit."
4.0,"This swimsuit is super cute on, and definitely looks better in person than it does in the photos.<br /><br />I typically prefer to wear the tankini style swimsuits when I am at the pool or beach, but recently have been trying out some new styles and this one really caught my eye. I do have to say in person, the green is slightly more of a minty green as opposed to the lime green that it appears so be conscious of that when ordering if that is something that makes a difference to you. I am a fan of green in general, so it wasn't a big enough difference to matter to me, it's beautiful either way.<br /><br />The suit is well made,and didn't have any loose threads or anything. I typically wear a 10/12 in clothing, and following the size chart, I ordered this in an XL and it fit me perfectly. The only spot that was a bit tight at first was the hook that clasps behind the neck, but I think that was only because I have a large chest pulling the fabric forward. With that being said, this cups in this suit easily accommodated my large chest, which is a size 34i. There is plenty of fabric and I am completely covered when wearing this. I received one to review, and am very happy with it. I love that it is stylish and still covers me fully while the little cutouts give it a cute style."
4.0,Great Fabric and color. Look Fabulous . But only problem is it is on the smaller size. Maybe great to tie on purse
4.0,"The product was ok. The Material reminds me of a Halloween costume though. If you are a woman who doesn't mind showing it off then by all means yes! I wore this on vacation in Cancun, it worked out so that's why I give the stars."
4.0,"This is a really great adjustable band. The only issue I have is that the clasp (where the magnet is) is very sharp and occasionally gets caught on clothing, bedding, etc. I've had the band for 6 weeks now and have snagged 4 items. For me, it isn't too big of a deal, the pros definitely outweigh the one con, but just something to be aware of. If the clasp could be smoothed/filed down, it would be perfect!"
4.0,Good quality but runs very small
4.0,Love the colors. They seem a bit small but i like how they look in my ears. Very light and make wearing them nice. My ears are very sensitive but I am able to wear them continually for days without an issue.
4.0,"Very cute, mine came with a small scratch on the lens. But still super cute."
4.0,Dri fit material very good
4.0,Perfect for tall men. Soft fabric; fantastic price!
4.0,Overall I liked the sweater. It’s a basic large comfy sweater dress. It comes to my knees and has a a good quality for the price. I have really long arms so I like that the sleeves were long enough
4.0,"Pretty, flows, light and comfortable."
4.0,"I was intrigued becauseof the cute patterns and individual wrapping which is perfect for stocking stuffers. I would buy them again, however, these are not the ""thick"" wool socks you're thinking of. They have the thickness of a regular pair of hanes cotton socks. Just want people to know what they're getting!"
4.0,Nice jewelry<br />Great buy
4.0,The neck dipped lower than expected but fit beautifully
4.0,I ordered a size up because I’m pregnant and it’s a little tight still. It’s really comfy and soft and will be great for my prenatal yoga sessions
4.0,"It’s a effort to get into cause of all the hooks, I like bra better if it held my boobs , don’t waste your money"
4.0,"Good quality bag, racket case is a little small."
4.0,Super cute and looks just like the picture. Its a little flimsy though so I will have to be careful but it was so cheap its a good deal!
4.0,"I was worried that this dress was going to be too short based on prior reviews, but it was perfectly fine on me. For reference, I am 5'4, 115 lbs, 32C, and I usually wear a size 2 or a 26 in pants. It's a little too baggy up top but not so much so that I'm worried about my boobs falling out of it. I probably could have gotten an XS instead of a S, but I'll likely just shorten the straps a little even though the dress is fine as is. Color is a little less orange than it appears in the picture; it is very much the literal color of mustard. Dress isn't sheer and the fabric isn't flimsy but isn't stiff either. Would recommend!"
4.0,Nice looking watch. But the links are very hard to take out.
4.0,As pictured. Material is cheap and didn’t last long after washing.
4.0,Nice belt but I still prefer an adjustable braid belt.
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter and she loves them
4.0,I love everything about this dress. Very flattering for curvy girls!!!
4.0,These ear warmers definitely keep your ears warm. I also was able to keep an earpiece in my ear without any problem.  They did not muffle sound either. They were comfortable and stayed in place. I gave it 4 stars because the band that wraps around the back of your head is not quite as pliable as I would like it to be.  But for the price they are worth it. In Texas I won't wear them that often.
4.0,Love everything about both pair I wear them to dinner church work etc. so fashionable and affordable
4.0,This dress is a tent. There is no fitted part anywhere. It’s polyester and I can’t figure out which is the front and which is the back. I’ll end up wearing a tank top under it for the Pride Parade this weekend. I hope I don’t melt because of the material. The pockets are al plus.
4.0,Would like a better price break
4.0,A bit large but overall comfortable and flattering
4.0,The material is a bit thin so I'll probably wear a slip underneath. The color and fit are nice
4.0,Loved everything about it...fits well and it's just as described
4.0,its neat
4.0,Color is true. Wasn't expecting it to be plastic but I guess that why it's light weight. Size and look was true as well too.
4.0,"I truly love this bracelet, especially when I wear it around my versa 3,giving it the appearance of rhinestone wraparound band. Only criticism is the colors are a little bland."
4.0,I loved everything about the clutch except for the zipper which sticks a little.  It's a great color and size!
4.0,I had been looking for a tassel style earrings but they’re usually too big and heavy. These are light weight and comfortable to wear all day. Love having a trendy little pop of color.
4.0,"I ordered a Large (size 12-14) and they fit well. They have a good amount of stretch and are lightweight. Though they're denim the material is so flexible I feel like I'm wearing Spandex. They're comfortable and surprisingly non-sticky in hot weather. The only thing is that the length is extremely short - if you feel self conscious about your thighs I wouldn't recommend them as these shorts expose more of you than other shorts. It's like a Daisy Dukes short-short. Except for that, they're pretty cool."
4.0,"Good item, it works great while you are working out. Great value for the money."
4.0,"I love the colors and the feel of the fabric. Unfortunately, this ran small and was very tight in the chest. I had to return it."
4.0,"Not bad, I like the thin straps showing under a t-shirt dress."
4.0,love the natural fabric and the gathering at the waist. Wish it was a little looser on me like it is on the models. I am 5'3&#34; 180 lbs. The XLarge is snug.
4.0,This hat is just as pictured.  Worked great after a medical procedure to block the sun off my face.  It's comfortable too.
4.0,It's cute. The seam came lose after about a week of wear. So the stuffing just... came out. I had to sew it up myself. Needs to be more durable.
4.0,Dramatic. Bigger than I realized.
4.0,"Super soft on the inner band and looks great on a two-tone watch. We will see how the leather holds up in the long run. I have recently swapped out the original buckle for a deployment clasp buckle to increase the longevity of the leather. The only downside is that band is a little too thin for the deployment clasp, which makes the buckle on the clasp really stick out. Other than that, very nice."
4.0,"I orignally ordered this ring to use as a wedding band.  I was very pleased when it came.  It was packaged well and shipping was very fast.  The ring is beautiful, very sparkly and comfortable to wear.  It does not match my engagement ring the way I had hoped and the size I ordered was a little big because they did not offer half sizes so I will be returning it.  Otherwise I would keep it."
4.0,"These were definitely on the small side and my toddler could barely put them on (she is in a size 5.5 to 6 and we got the 5/6 size). She was excited until she had to try to squeeze into them, and now she refuses to wear them and says they are for babies. We are giving to them a friend, otherwise I would have returned. Based on my purchase, I would recommend sizing up. They are very cute otherwise!"
4.0,Very nice.  It is a christmas present for my niece.  Only thing is I should have read the size of the pendent.  It is smaller than a dime.
4.0,"I really like the look and feel of these, and I like being able to put the essential oils on the lava rocks. However, the part where you can tighten or loosen the bracelet become unraveled, so the bracelet doesn't tighten anymore and just falls off my wrist. Too bad. These are nice."
4.0,Thought it would have more hair on it.  Still good though.
4.0,Shirt is good material. Have to steam or iron it after each wash. Nice pale color. Bought in black too.
4.0,"This is perfectly fine. Does it feel like the absolute best quality item? No, but it serves its purpose and looks nice!"
4.0,Good quality. Cute
4.0,"For the price, this can't be beat. True it isn't as soft or comfy as some others in this category, but it also doesn't cost $100+ and mine became more comfortable as I gave it a few washes with fabric softener. I don't think I've worn it once without getting multiple compliments. Oversized so I can use it as a poncho, or just lay it on the beach as a towel. Also love the pocket which is big enough to fit multiple items and the hood which is also nice and big."
4.0,"I wish there was more room for my Locks, I have a lot  of hair"
4.0,I took off a star because it isn’t very soft. Not like a normal sweatshirt. The color is really cute and it fits true to size. No stretch to it though. I do wish it was a softer fabric but other than that I like it.
4.0,Colors are beautiful really does call out for attention
4.0,"Tight around forehead, but nothing a lil stretching can't fix. Thin though, not made for warmth. Took awhile to ship. Worth the $4, It's cute"
4.0,"I love the overall style of the dress (3/4 sleeve length, A line) because this is more modest and as a practicing Christian I find this to be great.<br />The dress came with a smell out of the package...like mint? wash it & it’ll go away.<br />The color I ordered (beige) was just a tad different in person; It has a light pink undertone; still a nice color, just unexpected.<br /><br />The material is really soft but it shows EVERYTHING if you don’t wear the right undergarment. You can see the individual fat rolls around my stomach/back. Lol. You can also see the cellulite in my butt/thigh area. Shapewear will fix this.<br /><br />If you have smaller boobs/smaller frame like the model I’m very sure this dress will look like the picture.<br />If you have bigger boobs like me it wont fit at the chest loosely like the model. The dress will be tighter at the chest and THEN start to flare out. My breasts are always noticeable even with baggy sweatshirts you can still see the “full shape” of them (You know what I mean ladies) so don’t let this deter you.<br /><br />I just wanted to give a heads up to who it may apply but I recommend this dress. Just wash it, wear some spanx, a good bra & you’re good to go (if needed)!"
4.0,Bought for my daughter who is petite. It was too big.
4.0,"I really like this dress. I ordered in the green and it’s a beautiful color. The fabric is really nice. When I washed and dried it did not shrink drastically and the fabric came out looking the same at least for the first wash. It’s very oversized so order a size down from what you think. I was looking at this dress as a maternity dress/post partum dress (I’m 25 weeks pregnant, 5’7” and my pre-pregnant weight was about 190 lbs) and in my search for those kinds of dresses I’m generally looking at sizes XL-XXL. But after reading reviews of this dress I ordered a L and it fits well. It’s oversized under the arm so it can’t really be worn without a decorative bra/bralette or an undershirt. But that’s okay because that makes it perfect for breastfeeding when I wear it postpartum. It’s VERY long. I’m 5’7” and it brushed the top of my feet. But I also have a pretty big belly right now so it probably would hang lower if I wasn’t pregnant. I ended up cutting 4” off the bottom and leaving a raw edge on it. I haven’t decided if I’ll hem it later or not. I used the extra fabric to make a braided sash/belt to give it better definition up top. Otherwise it kinda hangs like a sack. That’s okay if that’s the look you’re going for. I just didn’t like it on me. I haven’t decided if I want to order a couple more in other colors or keep looking for other dresses."
4.0,"I bought this a couple of months ago and decided to wear it to work and I love it! I only have a couple of issues, one of which the sleeves are little tight and the other issue is that the dress is not form fitting at the bottom which is not a big issue. Overall, the dress is super cute and I loved the purple color."
4.0,"Good adapters, work well to add a generic band to the Apple Watch.  However, the bar is a bit thicker than a typical spring-bar on a regular watch, so it might require more finesse to install on bands with a smaller hole."
4.0,Great price and great product! Its very comfortable and looks stylish too
4.0,"This is a gorgeous dress. I<br />Make sure it's the Gloria & Sarah brand. It has some weight to it. Not cheap or thin at all.<br />I'm 5'7, 225, DDD cup. The dress does hug my curves, XL. But I honestly could have gone one size down."
4.0,"Wife loves it, good fit she’s a small woman 5’ 100+ pounds. Good night to type like to host (adjustable).<br /><br />United States Navy ret."
4.0,"I’ve actually gotten great use out of this wig. I initially bought it back in 2015 for a cosplay I was doing. It’s certainly a costume wig. However, I pulled her out of my dusty storage bin, gave her a face lift and now I can wear this hair for more fun. 4 stars bexase you can see the tracks through the hair in several areas, but for $10 it’s beeb fun."
4.0,I literally have obsession to this color. That's the only reason i bought it. Turns out that the quality of the wallet is satisfying. I like how soft feel it has. And enough room for my cards and phone as well.
4.0,"I wear a 7 and these were a little large - not unwearable, but I think I could have worn the small comfortable.  Cute with the Joules boots."
4.0,"This is a very cute barbell, and I love the pearl accents! It hangs well and is not too long, nor too short. The barbell was also delivered nearly a month earlier than expected.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this product four stars instead of five is that it was in pieces in the package in which it was delivered. One of the two pearl dangles had come detached from the bow charm, and the barbell had also become separated from the bow. I was able to put the pieces back together fairly easily and I also reinforced the metal ring holding it all together by squeezing it closed with a tweezers. Although it was easy to fix, it seemed that this product was sloppily thrown together by its producers and fell apart during shipping."
4.0,Did take a While in delivery. These are cute though.
4.0,Very pretty but much smaller than expected even with picture indicating size.
4.0,I got this sports bra for my teenage daughter.  It fits her well and she says it is very comfortable.  It looks well made.  The color is nice.
4.0,"I got these non-skid memory foam house shoes for my mom. She is disabled and needs a good shoe that fits good, to wear around the house. We used to get her house shoes, like this at a local big box store, but they haven't been stocking them lately, so when I saw these on Amazon, I rushed to get them. Although these are a bit tight, they are still wearable, and as she has worn them, they have relaxed to fit her fit better. I give these shoes 4 stars only because of the tight fit from the beginning."
4.0,I am 5'10&#34; 155lbs 36B. I ordered a MED and it fit perfectly! My only complaint is that it is much shorter on me than in the picture. More like just below the calf.
4.0,good deal for the price.
4.0,"I am an avid SUPer, these small floaties fit on the bow of my glasses. If I go fo a dunk and my expensive glasses come off, this little gadget allows them to float so I can retrieve. Sorta of a PFD for your shades. Well worth the purchase. Many colors to choose also"
4.0,"This is the most different looking chain I have ever seen. When it first arrived, I thought I had been sent the wrong product or maybe I have.  I purchased the chain to wear with my everyday locket and needed a smaller chain to fit the bale.  I ordered a 2mm; however, I believe the one I was sent is more like a 1.5mm or less?  I minded at first, but now I am appreciating it because of the look..  My locket is a sterling silver heart-shaped pendant that is very dainty-like. Actually, the thinner chain does look better.; this is when I became okay with the thinner chain.  Instead of appearing silver as it should appear because it is sterling, it looks white.  It is white and has a silver shimmer to it.  It almost looks like a Christmas item. I have never seen another one like it.  As I stated it is very thin and is definitely not a 2mm.but the white shimmering look makes up for it.  One more thing to add, when you look at it under a 10X loop, it is definitely all silver. I do not know why it gives the impression of looking all white with the silver shimmer.  If anyone or the seller knows, please inform."
4.0,They don't fit my newborn yet but they are super cute!
4.0,"Bought this for my daughter . Is just as advertised and is very good sized. Only rated 4 stars due to the fact that the picture of a labrador looks more like any generic dog, but that's just me being picky."
4.0,The only problem I have is I am left handed. So I put my belt on from different side. With LSU buckle if I put on my left handed way it would be upside down.but that's cool. Love the belts. I have to do it right handed. The other buckles work fine for being totally a leftie. I purchase 4 belts and I love them. Saw it on shark tank and knew Amazon would have them.
4.0,"So im currently pregnant I'm normally a small I got a medium in hopes it will work during and after and it should. So the bottom of the shirt/top rolls uo at the bottom. Like u when u make clothing into a crop top at home type ordeal. (In my side shot pic u can see its also rolled in the back of the shirt and that it's not just my belly causing the roll even though thats why its as extreme as it is in the front.) STRING DOESNF TIGHTEN THE WAIST. FAIR WARNING. BUT IT STILL HAS ELASTICIT IN THE BAND.  I'm always sad when the strings are decoration but it does fit me and I'm hoping there's enough of that elastic band thing to keep it tight after baby arrives. Cute, soft, comfy. This is a hard review like I'm trying to point out anything that can be a flaw type of review."
4.0,"I really liked this dress however, the orange that I got was more of a burnt orange. The dress also has two layers and the under layer is about 3 inches shorter than the top layer causing the dress to rise up. I’m 5’8 and I ordered a large which was way too short. I overall think the dress is super cute and of good quality. I’m just disappointed that it was so short!"
4.0,Feels a little cheap. The cloth isn't that comfortable but for $10 it's okay for the value.
4.0,It is what I expected. Light weight.
4.0,"Suits run small so go up 2 sizes, yes 2 sizes.  I received mine, XL when I usually wear a M, it fits well.  Nice color and material.  I use for swimming at the pool."
4.0,"This is a princess cut. Berry long. In 5’6” and it almost touches the floor, it cinches just below my bust. Supper comfortable and looks dressy"
4.0,"So cute and &#34;flowy.&#34; Drapes beautifully. Runs true to size. I sized up, thinking they would run small, but I'm constantly pulling them up. They don't shrink in the wash, either. Still love these pants despite the fact. So comfortable!"
4.0,"Runs very large. I just reordered a smaller size, I hope it will fit. The fabric and design are amazing!"
4.0,"Beautiful shirt! Well-made and good quality material and ink. It’s definitely intended to be a tighter fitting shirt. I ordered an XL and I hoped for a looser, more comfortable fit but it didn’t work for the look I was hoping for. Also not a good fit for women with a large bust- the sleeves showed more of my side bra cups than I like."
4.0,"Nice band and will probably last longer than others I've purchased. I guess I didn't measure wuite right because it's a little short for my wrist. I make it work, but it could be a bit longer."
4.0,Quality is great and I still might buy one but I need to know it'll fit.
4.0,"I love the material, so soft & comfy.  Was a little big on top but it is a beautiful shirt."
4.0,"Cute, but very, very small and thin.  I bought them for a gift, but inspected them prior to wrapping them."
4.0,"I really like the piece.  But, It doesn't quite look like a snowflake.  I thought is was to look a little like a snowflake.  However, it is a lovely piece and I like the size."
4.0,Cuter in the picture.
4.0,Love the sleek and style haven't tried it on yet but will be soon so I'll keep u updated on how it holds up
4.0,Super wide brim and comfortable
4.0,"This is a beautiful, classy Fitbit bracelet Band and I love it!  The look makes me feel like I'm wearing an expensive watch while also being practical at the same time.  I didn't give it a 5 star rating due to the fact that it was so big upon arrival and had to be taken into a jeweler to have 6 links removed and cost me an additional $16.00!  Still, the look is worth it and my watch is lovely and stylish."
4.0,"I just received this suit today. After putting it on, it is fairly snug but it feels super sexy and is exactly what I wanted. And the two way zipper should make things very interesting in bed😉😉."
4.0,Got the ties for my son.  Good quality & right price.
4.0,"A bit more narrow than expected, but I am 56, so a bit behind the times, most likely.  Good if not great quality, well worth the price."
4.0,The belt was nice but its smaller in person.
4.0,Looks great. The fabric is a little stiff.
4.0,super cute!!! and is adjustable
4.0,Rock is pretty big but I like it a lot.
4.0,The Apron looks good and easy to use. I like the product but haven't washed it yet. Will see how it will be after a wash. So far everything looks good.
4.0,Nice dress a little wide but I received lots of compliments.
4.0,Really like this but the arm holes at the wrist are VERY large.
4.0,Cute hat! Arrived in good condition.
4.0,The band update and upgraded the look of my Fitbit!
4.0,"I love the earrings but I have to dock it a star because of the packaging. There was no protection for them, they were in a brown envelope. So some of the backs were bent and its very hard to straighten them out without breaking them."
4.0,"comfortable, reasonably priced , pretty good support"
4.0,Perfect fit and very warm!
4.0,"It's a perfect dress to wear to work. Comfortable and has pockets, what could be better?!?"
4.0,"Like the look.  Like the fit, but it narrows at ankle which makes it uncomfortable to walk"
4.0,"Got this for a gift to one of my friends. Everything on it looks great, the only thing I noticed was that it says Strong Than Yesterday. Other than that my friend thought it was awesome."
4.0,These look great! Quality not so great. But you get what you pay for. Cheap but cute.
4.0,GIVEN IT AWAY
4.0,"Too small for my wrist, but most things are. If you have issues with one size fits all things, and think it may be too small for your wrist, then it will be too small. However it seems decently made, and just gave it to my girl. Haven't tried soaking up any oils in it yet. If she does I will update my review later with the findings there."
4.0,It looks really beautiful on any plain top.
4.0,"Under a magnifying glass, these earrings are cute!  Photos in description were misleading ....."
4.0,"Look, I'm no authentic jade guru but I wanted a jade ring because it spoke to me. Ordered this little stack & when they came I was pleased. One was cracked but not broken. I wear it. It's not noticeable.  I thibk its a good purchase 😌"
4.0,"I should have order the 3t, but he will get plenty of wear out of it. He lives the dinos!!"
4.0,they break pretty easy but theres lots so its not to much of a problem and unclip often but work for a picture or a couple hours
4.0,"V liked it,awesome"
4.0,Way too small so am having to give as a gift to another. Otherwise I really liked the top and was disappointed about the siziing.
4.0,"I'm a knitter.  I could handknit socks like this for cheaper than $20, it's true.  However, I couldn't do it easily.  Socks are the main type of project that gives me ceaseless headaches.  I'm happy to pay $20 for these high-quality, fun and sturdy socks.  My only beef  is that I bought the Medium (I'm a size 8) hoping they'd still fit after laundering.  I got them today and laundered them immediately, and they are now almost - *almost* - too small.  They feel like compression socks now.  So in the future I'll be ordering the Large so that they shrink comfortably to my foot instead of squeezing.  (For your reference, my laundry cycle includes a cold water 'casual' wash in Dreft followed by an 80-minute hot tumble dry.  This is, I mean, for a full load of laundry!  I wouldn't launder just one pair of socks.)"
4.0,"The jacket is just as I imagined it. I read previous reviews and order a size bigger which was a XXL. I'm 5'5&#34; and wear about a size 12-14. The only problem I would say is that I won't be able to wear bulky clothing underneath it. Other than that, I love it. The style is great!"
4.0,This shirt was a different brand than the first shirt and much better quality. It was a little large on him as he normally wears a XL but the XL I first ordered was poor quality and way too small. Therefore we will keep this shirt and hoping it will shrink a little in the wash.
4.0,Beautiful shoes they just run small
4.0,For pajamas there needs to be a more generous cut in the hips area for easier movement while sleeping
4.0,"Very pretty ring, looks great and is a unique piece."
4.0,The pants become static easy but they look nice!
4.0,"I read all of the reviews before purchasing so I was aware that there was no support from this bra. I was looking for something that would basically cover my nipples and this is definitely it. I like it and it's going to do the job well. The only thing I would have liked it to have would have been removable cup inserts. All in all, price is great, product is sufficient, and it will be used for my purposes well."
4.0,"Gifted to my hubby. Fits fine, per size ordered. Nice, lightweight material. Don't dry it on high, it'll shrink a bit (as expected though, for cotton jersey) but it stretches back out. Good clear paint on the logo thing."
4.0,Easy to use and great selection on sizes. Great start up kit for stretching.
4.0,Nice light cap for summer walking
4.0,Very nice product and quality.
4.0,"But other than that, it is perfect!  I will need to purchase an extender to wear it."
4.0,Size up 2! I’m normally a size medium but got an XL. It fits perfect. Not tight at all but not too oversized.
4.0,I bought a large but I think I should have bought a larger size. The zipper keeps sliding down and popping open. Excellent quality and would buy it again
4.0,Lots of great rings. Some were bent or the jewels were offset
4.0,"Comfortable, good quality fabric. Only 4 stars because some of the stitching on the left sleeve came undone and had to be repaired."
4.0,The top part was to small...but a very cute dress.
4.0,"It looks shinier in the picture than it is in real life.  This is a full, natural leather look.  It definitely has that handmade look with no bonding or stitching.  The only stitching is to attach the buckle and it’s only a couple sturdy hand stitches which make it look great for jeans.  The buckle looks handmade as well and quite sturdy.  The leather is soft and supple and definitely smells of real leather.<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend this for dressing up but it would be perfect for jeans, even with a collared shirt."
4.0,HAPPY WITH THEM
4.0,Brought as a gift and he loves it
4.0,Package was crappy but I put them all in their own box and they were perfect! My girls love them
4.0,"These are great we wore them to the water park, mesh holes are large enough that I could see her wearing them to the beach"
4.0,Pay attention to size conversion. Becuse it's elastic & drawstring ordering 1 size up then your normal size can't  go wrong. Love the pockets. Material is more coarse then expected but not irritating
4.0,My son did manage to break one pair of these at the &#34;hinges&#34; but the company replaced them. They fit his face better than the Miraflex brand and are much more affordable. If your child has a low bridge on the nose (common with Asian faces) these may fit better than other styles. At least that's been the case for my boys.
4.0,I receive this yesterday I love it I got color white too...but sad part is my large size for me is fit...I really love it tho
4.0,"Mostly I wear size 7 or 7.5 but this one I need 8.5 because even 8 didn’t fit me so yes overall its a cute comfy slipper, so I am returning and buying size 8.5"
4.0,This fabric and cut of this dress is so pretty...but it was a bit tighter in the waist/skirt area than I expected. I recommend ordering a size up for curvy and fuller-figured gals.
4.0,I’m 5’10” and a size 6. Amazon recommended a size M for me but it was huge. The small was just right. The belt is really long. Overall it’s a nice dress for a ‘50s sock hop I’m attending.
4.0,I really like these but they are constantly falling out of my body. The clamping mechanism doesn't seem to work with this size wire.
4.0,"Very cute design but a little cheaper made hat than I was expecting for the price. The back is velcro, not snaps. Hopefully that holds up"
4.0,"Quite pretty, and the recipient is quite happy with it.<br /><br />Note: Had a few very distinct scratches, but on the underside, so not worth returning. Also, the box was badly crushed (despite a blemish-free shipping container) and no longer suitable for giving as a gift. (I took it out of the original box, assembled, and boxed/wrapped it myself.)"
4.0,"Thought it'd be a unique alternative to baggy swim trunks you see around, but this leaves nothing to the imagination. I can't imagine getting in the water with it- wearing it dry leaves very obvious wiener definition. Rides a little low too...lower thank you think it might. If you're into showing a little crack and letting people know exactly what's going on under the belt, go for it. Definitely order a size up- I'm a 30inch waist and got a Medium, it's form-fitting but not constricting or tight.<br />Update: their customer service is incredible. They contacted me about a refund, and I hadn't even thought to contact them or make a big deal about it. Definitely an awesome business to buy from."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:a6703d9682b84de332aa24ef032f855e]] I think the watch band is very compatible and very similar to the Apple Watch band.
4.0,"Loved the color, quality size. However outside side zipper kept splitting apart. Fearful of getting caught on something was able to return. Sad about returning."
4.0,"Really nice socks and fit me well! I am 5'2&#34; & size 16 and I was worried these would be too tight, but actually fit very well. They dont quite go up around my thighs but roll down nicely over my knees. Overall great!"
4.0,I bought this for my youngest son because his pants are always too big and needs a belt but has trouble buckling it by himself while at school. Unfortunately it was too small to use as a buckles belt for now but I was delighted to see it did have a buckle option. I will try and show that in my pictures. He is kind of skinny for a 4 year old. Has about a 2t waist for reference.  I also used it on my older son who is 9. Very versatile.
4.0,"Runs a bit small, but is sturdy."
4.0,They are polarized as stated. Quality matches the price. The problem with these is that you have a visible reflection on the outer edges when wearing them. That's why it's a 4 star.
4.0,"I really liked this bathing suit, however I ordered a size small and the top was a little bit too big. The bottoms were a little too small where your legs go. I wish you could order two separate sizes! I'm going to deal with it though because I do like the suit a lot."
4.0,The fitness great bought me hem for my son
4.0,This was a gift for my husband. He likes souvenirs from movies.<br />Kinda thought the impressions on the coin would be a bit more clear.
4.0,"They are very elegant, but the gold color is not as vibrant as the image shows."
4.0,Love the short they are very light weight and cool on hot days. They were a little big. Wish I had gotten the next size smaller.
4.0,Bought these for my husband for xmas and they fit well and seem to be decent gloves.  I had hoped the pictures were a little dark but they aren't.  If you're looking for an obviously really brown pair of gloves these are not them.  But they are great gloves.
4.0,"good price, light weight, good fit for a medium sized woman's head"
4.0,"Looks good, fit isn't quite right, but plastic band hats aren't."
4.0,se ajusta bien
4.0,Cool! good looking. Serves its purpose.
4.0,"We used this for party favors for my daughters 7th unicorn party. She loved everything that came with it and so did the other kids. The keychains broke off her backpack the first day, but we just put a new chain on them. The strings for the mask don't stay in very well, but I think it was worth the $."
4.0,It’s fitted bigger than I expected
4.0,"The helmet did not come with the spike on the top as advertised, which is why it gets a 4 and not a 5. I ended up not needing it, as I painted it and modified the horns. Overall, great product for the price. It is a bit big, so you'll need to put in some padding on the inside rim if you want a snugger fit on your head."
4.0,but runs big. I slide off of it if I walk faster because its big and soft. My husband fits it perfectly and he's a 10.5.
4.0,"These straps are great and have a very large capacity. However, they are difficult to adjust, particularly when on a box or piece of luggage. I couldn't really cinch them down on my trade show case, instead I had to unclip, guess on how much to adjust the straps, then test on the box again. Very inefficient."
4.0,"Gorgeous color, gorgeous fabric weight, very flattering front view although the neckline is too low for work in a professional office. I could have dealt with that with a cami or lace panel though.<br /><br />What I can't deal with is how the skirt sucks up under my backside and rides up toward my waist as I move.<br /><br />So sorry to have to return this gorgeous dress as there is no way another size option would fit appropriately, even if there was one."
4.0,Impressed my sister ... and it was exactly what she needed for her &#34;short&#34; trips around her region.
4.0,"While the quality is really nice, it's a tad too small. It fits fine but I'd like it better if it didnt slip off my head so easily."
4.0,You cant have too many credit cards & coins with this wallet because it won't close. I find that I have to carry a separate case for my cards.
4.0,Good loafer for 18 month old easy on. And stayed on.
4.0,"I am in love with this outfit. It’s very soft and very cute, but it runs very small. Order a size up!"
4.0,"I typically wear a medium or large. Ordered XL based on reviews. Glad I did, they are fitted like a size medium in other brands. Body and sleeves are sufficiently (not overly) long."
4.0,"I love the hat, but the brim is a little to big for me, only problem that i had, and that's because my back is bad, and it's hard to keep my head up straight anymore. Great Cap though."
4.0,"Well made dress, definitely worth the money."
4.0,"Cute, nice coverage, and I really like the tint! Frames are cheap, but should be ok for awhile. At least, the was I go through sunglasses..."
4.0,"Chokers are very in right now and I like this one since it's a flexible material that doesn't irritate my neck. It catches the light well and has a nice shiny look tonit that could be dressed up or, worn to work on a whim like I did, for fun. The neck is adjustable as well so it can fit several sizes"
4.0,"Good quality, very soft. The ""baby/toddler"" description is not accurate as this could nearly fit and adults head"
4.0,"Beautiful to look at and high quality with such a good price. The downside for me is that it was a bit larger than I expected, I don't like the fact there are no outside pockets (to slip the cell phone in) and there could also be more inside compartments for my taste as well."
4.0,This dress is very thick and since I live in a tropical climate- it will only be for cool days or evenings.  It’s very clingy and shows off my curves.  I’m a little concerned about how it also clings to my belly which is a bit round.  I can lose a few pounds or wear some shapewear and feel like it’s the perfect sexy dress.
4.0,"These head bands look great when you hold them,they are not as cute on the baby's head. (Not as large on baby's head as pictured) Very cute colors,very nice fit for most heads and comfortable for baby band is soft and not irritating on head. I would recommend"
4.0,"Very nice item, and I appreciate the extra set of attachment tabs.  It is a trifle long, which adds a bit of weight, but this is not annoying.  All in all, very serviceable."
4.0,They are really beautiful shoes but they are a bit too small to comfortably wear.<br />Also they smelled crazy bad when I first got them. Super chemically.<br />Make sure to order a size above what you normally wear.
4.0,"I really like this bifold. It is small enough to fit into my pocket, yet it has plenty of room for my cards and money. I especially like the three outside card holders that I can use without opening the hole bifold up. The leather is very soft. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the soft leather strap. I don't know how well the snap will hold up over time because of the softness. Other than that it's great and I would definitely buy it again if something happens to the one I have."
4.0,"Cute, comfy shirt for Disney!"
4.0,"I ordered these in my normal size, but they are a bit snug.  However, I love the color/pattern, they're comfortable, and as long as I wear a longer shirt, they look pretty good."
4.0,Slightly smaller than expected but the quality and cut is good.. My abs let it down 🤣 but definitely a great product.
4.0,Nice costume but the hat that came with it is awful. Do yourself a favor and order one of the licensed dumbledor hats.
4.0,"Alpine Loop (orange).  It's difficult to distinguish this band from its name brand competition.  Under intense light you can see it's slightly less opaque and has just a bit more elasticity than the Apple model.  Neither is detrimental and the marginally more elastic band may be more comfortable for some users.  The color is bright and vivid, the material strong, and only time will tell if it holds up -- but I expect it to.  Side by side it would be difficult to say the other is $75 better."
4.0,It is a very beautiful and good quality pyjama all the style and colors are immaculate but four stars because the top is right and the slacks a bit too loose. I  personally prefer them a bit tighter. I love that the fabric is 100 % cotton. Never shrinks or lose color after wash. I have many  pyjamas of this brand and am very satisfied and sleep well through the night. Thank you PyjamaGram
4.0,I wear a size 18 and ordered xl.  It fit perfect.  I ordered the red color. It was a true red. I needed a pop of color to wear with my black jumpsuit.  I received many compliments.  The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is the clasp looks cheap made.  In the picture it looks like silver studs or jewels but it is not.  The clasp does hold good.  I am glad I purchase this belt:)
4.0,"The Kolagri Women's Sexy Halter Criss Cross Tank Crop Top is what you wear when it is hot and you want to look hot.<br /><br />At first, I thought the neck strap was constructed wrong since there was a twist in it.  But when it is worn as shown in most pictures, the strap is flat.  The twist in front of the neck results in the back twist being eliminated.<br /><br />The material is soft and comfortable to wear.  The girls are lightly supported and are sure to draw attention."
4.0,Pretty earring but a bear to put on...I've lost the ball already.
4.0,"Good for the price.  A bit snug on my arms, but I do have bigger arms."
4.0,Nice quality. Good length. No problems with the product at all.
4.0,"This is a great looking suit. I ordered a few sizes up as suggested by other reviews. The fit is good, but there it's not much support in the bust"
4.0,"I love the relaxed shorts by Madewell. I usually have to size up for my ample thighs in shorts, but in this style I don't. However, the tile white color runs a size bigger than the 2 other colors I have bought. Still a great style for curvy gals, this color just runs bigger by about a size."
4.0,"The color is ""Soft Leather Brown"", the suspenders are actually Synthetic Leather. Otherwise I like them."
4.0,Great fit.. Really cute. Perfect summer dress. Maybe a little thin as material goes . But I will appreciate that when the temperature rises.
4.0,"VERY SHEER! had to wear a slip under it. other then that it was very cute and flowy, super nice for what i needed, very soft"
4.0,"I ordered my regular size, M. They fit in the length but the waste band is really wide which I don't like. I think I could have gone with an S but they may have been too short. The material is soft and they are comfy. I would not order again. They are not warm so they'll be nice for spring. I wanted thicker sweat pants without elastic at the bottom. These were not it."
4.0,I'm a curvy girl and so on my the shorts are pretty short and a little booty showing.  The hubs loves them but I'm definitely not taking out the trash in them to show off the bum to the neighbors.<br /><br />They are so comfortable though and soft.  I really like the soft material and it stretches a lot.  These are great for wear in the hot summer months and so comfortable to change into right after world.  The blue color is really vibrant and it pops.<br /><br />I like the shorts a lot but be aware that if you are curvy the bottoms might not be something you'd wear if you have kids at your house.  Luckily we just have the dogs now.
4.0,Love everything about this bag.  The print reminds me of a basket weave. It is light weight yet durable and so comfortable to carry.  Its really big though as I didnt pay attention to the dimensions when I ordered it.  Since its so large you might be tempted to overstuff it which could be a problem.  I bought it as a beach bag.  Its a little expensive to be throwing it around in the sand though.  Could easily as a weekender too.
4.0,A little larger than expected and no sash. I thought a sash came with it. Beautiful design though.
4.0,It's nice but not easy for the restroom!
4.0,"Definitely the cutest pair of sandals I own. Love the color, the platform, and the toe shape. The only downside is that they are a bit heavier than I'd prefer. Not the most comfortable, but still worth it!"
4.0,"Love the bracelet, although I was disappointed that the gems are dark. I expected them to be brighter in color. Still cute though."
4.0,"Love how warm this sweater is! It is above thick sweater, perfect for Mi winters. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of loose threads on it when I got it. I still wear it and hope they don’t unravel. But I love this warm sweater!"
4.0,Very very nice!!!!
4.0,"Beautiful Dress, with a little bit of a train in the back. It had a bit of stretch as well, which helped it fit better. The dress is a bit see through so be aware of your under garments."
4.0,"Fit is pretty much as expected! I bought as a maternity dress. I think it could be a little bit longer in length, but overall it's super cute!"
4.0,Un poquito grande no se ve muy bonito
4.0,Nice feel just ran a little small
4.0,They are perfect for the project I am working on.
4.0,"One of the earrings was broken on the top, but they’re still cute and enexpensive!"
4.0,"I like these simple belts to finish an outfit, I got them in every color, but they do stretch out pretty easily, so these are great for an accent, not so much to hold tight."
4.0,"This is a very lightweight pullover rain jacket. Fits well but is a little shorter that i would like. I am 5'10&#34; and weigh 230 lbs. Would probably be better for someone who was a little thinner than I. However, I will use this as I am trying to go ultralight for backpacking."
4.0,Cute mug. Socks were on the smaller side.
4.0,got it fast and looked good it was a gift
4.0,Nice quality. Fit great everywhere except the length of my torso.  It was digging into my shoulders. My torso may be too long for this and a small would be too big in the width of bottom half.
4.0,"Came without backs.  Fortunately, I had extras."
4.0,It is good shoes for youth cricket. It serves the purpose at good price.
4.0,"Darling shoes, but runs a bit big. Luckily the Velcro helps tighten them somewhat. I would order these again!"
4.0,just as look in the photo
4.0,"I bought 2 of these and I like them a lot. The material is a little thin, very soft, super comfortable."
4.0,"Great dress. I got many compliments. The material is soft and stretchy. It shows everything so be prepared to wear something like control top pantyhose. I’m 5’9 , pear shaped and 170 lbs. The large fit great. The only problem is the top sags and the sleeves don’t stay up. It’s worth getting altered though!"
4.0,It fit my 5 year old fine it just was very characterized. She loves me not so much.
4.0,Very nice my only concern is how to adjust it to my size.
4.0,Super cute  pattern and design however this is for someone under woman’s size 6 the waist is a lot smaller than it shows. I had to stretch it to fit my stomach which I’m a woman’s 6 /30 waist . It is very short and I’m 5’3. I am using this for a candy store photo shoot otherwise I would have returned it because it hurts on my stomach .Way small for me but perfect for a teenager or petite adult ! I didn’t have the issue others had with glitter it was fine for me<br /><br />Hope this review and photos help you
4.0,This went perfect with my green lantern Halloween custom!
4.0,Colors very nice
4.0,So far I like the fit and feel and am hoping they wear well
4.0,"The boot is an exceptional quality, and incredibly comfortable. It looks just like the picture. However, it does run a little larger than I expected. I typically wear a 9 and could have done with an 8 or 8.5 here. With thick socks, though, the larger size is not a problem. My only complaint is that the toe area is a little narrow despite the shoe being large. My toes get a bit uncomfortable when worn for a long time, but overall it's a great easy boot."
4.0,Pros: America!!!!<br /><br />Cons: Made in China<br /><br />I subtracted one star for not being made in America.<br /><br />USA! USA! USA! USA!
4.0,Only gave this a 4 because they fit smaller than size listed.
4.0,"A gift for a friend. I like it, I hope friend does too"
4.0,Such a cute skirt!! Fits great (used size chart to determine size and firs perfectly). Great to wear with a variety of tops and shoes to creat a different look each wear. Only reason its not 5 stars is the material is slightly thinner than I hoped.
4.0,"I am a belly dancer and needed knee pads for floor work. Some of the folk dances that use floor work are pretty intensive and I wish this knee pad had more cushion for those. However, I think this is a good product. I sometimes wear them even when not working on the floor because they have good knee support in general. They get a little hot, but I don't know of any pads that wouldn't. I will be buying a bulkier, more heavy duty pair of knee pads for practice and save these mostly for performance. Their slim lines on the leg makes them great for performance in sleeker costumes."
4.0,They feel very comfortable and the price was great.
4.0,"The picture looked like it was a long sweater, but when I received it, it looked liked the long part id something to tie up. I was looking for something long, but it did its job. It was for a choir performance and the sweater was the color I needed it. I also had no idea it was a sports product."
4.0,It's very light weight but it serves it's purpose.
4.0,For the price it was well worth it. I just wished the brim was larger.
4.0,"It just a perfect fit, very comfortable."
4.0,It's actually a butterfly
4.0,"The bottoms fit perfectly! I love this bathing suit. I just wish that you can request a different size for the tops. I'm 5'2 and 115Ibs. I have small breast (small b cup) but my bottom is larger. I went with the medium and although it fits on the bottom, the bikini top is too larger. Shipping time was perfect!"
4.0,"wore this to a black and white event and it was a big hit. got so many compliments and people asking me where I got it. only issue I had was the chest part was tight, and the arms were even tighter. not to the point where I had to struggle to get it on and be uncomfortable all night, just to wear I couldn't roll them up as it was a hot night and didn't realize the material was going to be as thick as it is. if I went a size bigger it wouldn't have looked the same as the medium I did get. 5'5 145lbs and ordered a medium."
4.0,These are very high quality socks. The only negative is they are a bit smaller than other socks listed to fit the same size of feet. I am a size 12 shoe and these socks fit a bit tighter than what I am used to.
4.0,"We bought this to be a costume.  It was cute.  Fit a bit large.  The only down side was a big bubble-gum pink print on one side of the chest area.  we tried to peel it off but sadly, it was stuck on pretty tightly.<br /><br />Since then, we've been using it as pajamas and our daughter loves to sleep in it."
4.0,This is the second time I've ordered these underwear. They are EXTREMELY comfortable. They do run a little large so I'd recommend sizing down. They fit higher up in the front (hit just below my belly button) which I love with my post-baby body. They aren't the sexiest things but they work for every day life and I will order again.
4.0,his product arrived quickly and in minimal packaging. Over all I am happy with this set of hat and gloves. The product is clearly knitted by a machine but the knitting is tight and the product is easily stretchable / flexible. The hat is surprisingly warm and soft and so are the gloves. For the price this is a great set and I am happy with it. I am also happy that the gloves allow you to use your swipe options on yuor phone as many dont. I had no problems using my phone with these gloves on.
4.0,The jacket itself is comfortable & stylish. It does have specific laundering instructions so don’t throw it in with just any mixed laundry but it is sized very small. Order at least 1 size above your normal size if you want you shoulders inside & the sleeves to go down your forearms.
4.0,My first set of bamboo clothing.  Great quality and comfortable to wear!  Will definitely be adding to my pj collection from this brand.
4.0,"I love the earrings, the backs are a little loose tho, trying to come up with a solution-<br />transaction was great, quick and the earrings are very pretty-"
4.0,fits my two year old just barely. love the all cotton though!
4.0,"This shirt is comfortable and soft.  It is long enough to wear with leggings and look appropriate.  I gave it three instead of four because it says it can be worn with x in front and back, however I thought it fit strange to have the x in back.<br />It has held up in three washes."
4.0,"The fabric is soft and comfortable. It allows lots of room for the baby to grow. The only thing I don’t care for is because of the design the side gather affects the back of the shirt as well, which isn’t growing in the same way. That is a personal preference though. For someone else, that might be the feature they like the most."
4.0,Están exactamente como yo lo esperaba muchas gracias
4.0,The bottoms fit good and the top was way to big!
4.0,Nice purse but I needed something a little less bulky!
4.0,It worked nicer with shapewear.
4.0,Lenses aren't as big as I wanted...
4.0,"This little ""safe"" (wallet) is a great way to save some money in the casino.  Once money is in, you are NOT getting it out without the key."
4.0,Super stretchy and comfortable!! The color is different in person but is still cute. I would describe it at purplish blue.
4.0,it’s super flattering but it’s right so if you don’t want it to hug your body size up but it’s a little shorter than expected
4.0,"The little rubber bands broke instantly when putting the glasses arms through them. The beaded chain is fine. I will just have to get more bands for it. Not happy, because this was a gift."
4.0,"I purchased this to pierce my ears and yes it works however, if you are not a master at it I would not recommend it. I did pierce my ears aa couple of times and it worked but every time I did it it got more painful the next. the pieces that they give you to put in your ears or wherever did not work for me, I ended up putting other earrings I had."
4.0,The description says it’s kelly green and that’s exactly the color it is. It looks darker in the picture so if you’re expecting it to be a darker green you’ll be disappointed. It is still a really pretty color and fits great though!
4.0,"very nice, like these bracelets.."
4.0,"My husband's had his original wallet for decades & i purchased this as a replacement.  It's good quality leather & the EGA logo is embossed perfectly on the front flap.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because the picture shows one flap as having a &#34;window&#34; where he can place his id.  But both side flaps are only made for cards.  The middle portion has the only mesh window on the wallet.  His original wallet had a clear plastic window, which allowed him to open the glap and easily show his ID.  Now he'll just have to remove his ID card upon entry to the builidng."
4.0,"Even though this is from China, order your true size.  I would normally order a large, but ordered up to a XXXL.  It was way too big!  I’ll alter it to fit, but not everyone can do that.  It’s decent quality and I would order again, but in a smaller size."
4.0,"I wear a ladies 7 1/2 W sneaker so I bought a Large slipper. I used to only be able to wear open-toe slippers because my feet would get too hot if closed-toe. Then, while wearing open-toe slippers, I broke my toe....twice.  That put my family in quite a bind, and thus the search was on for me-approved closed-toe slippers.  The search took a while.  I finally took a chance on these Cellicigal Cotton Knit Anti-Slip Indoor Slippers six months ago. They are soooo comfortable! The inside is a plush material, but not too plush and hot - just right.  They are loose-fitting enough to allow plenty of air circulation. The pink plush is pretty; the grey outer material not so pretty, but it does have a thin colorful band over the toebox which helps the look. The sole is flexible, rubbery, and truly non-slip on wooden floors. I like that I can briefly go outside in them and not have to change into shoes. At first, I could get these on my feet without using my finger for the heel (like a shoehorn) because the back was stiff enough.  Over a few months, the stiffness wore down so now I have to use my finger to finish getting my heel in. Not a deal-breaker because they are still stiff enough to stay on just fine. The outer top started to ""pill"" after a couple of months. I wear these a lot and am not worried about house slippers pilling. On my former slippers, the stitching holding the sole to the footbed was on the bottom of the slipper, causing the stitching to break and the whole thing fall apart in two months.  With my current slippers, the stitching is on the side because the sole wraps up onto the sides by about a half-inch. Good design! I am a little short and so when I sit in this chair, my toes rest on the floor and bow out my slipper's toe area. Now after these six months, the stitching on part of one side has come loose and will soon unravel the whole slipper.  I also noticed that where my big toe is, the slipper is getting worn through. I do put more pressure there than most people, and this is a typical pattern of wear for me. I washed these twice and they did great in the washing machine and briefly in the dryer, then allowing them to air-dry the rest of the way.  Though I was hoping these would last me a year, my conclusion is that it is very difficult to find slippers as comfortable as these and maybe my habits are hard on them. I will buy again."
4.0,They're cute but Minnie doesn't look quite right. I'm not sure how well they'll hold up (I'm thinking the print will probably wear off after a couple wearings and washings)
4.0,"Nicely made, Perfect look of the butterfly with the decorations in the wing.  Looks great with my tye dyes"
4.0,They are really cute but a little large for me but with a wig band it helped keep it from slipping. I would recommend these to everyone.
4.0,This is a good quality product just wish it was bigger.
4.0,Love it! It is big and love the stretchy strap! The fuzzies aren’t as soft as was hoping but it is nice. A little pricey for material
4.0,I’ve had the bag for a little over a week and it still has a strong mothball smell. The fabric is smooth and soft. Some of the stitching is coming out. Good product for the cost.
4.0,"Although the price has increased, the item is still good value and true to the photo."
4.0,"I'm a shoe size 9 and after reading the reviews about the slippers being way too big, I ordered down a size to 7-8 and hoped they would fit. They're definitely snug, and I do wish I had another quarter inch in the toebox, but since it's soft cashmere, it's not too bad. The slippers themselves are nice - the cushioning is silky soft and the cashmere is very warm! I just wish the manufacturer was more accurate about size and had a couple more size options."
4.0,Wish there were belt loops to hold the belt in place. Very pretty fabric.
4.0,Great turn around time. Very nice hat. It did not have the clover button. Other than that very happy. As good as the Hannah collection. I buy a hat every year from across the pond. Excellent buy.
4.0,"took a couple days to untangle them from shipping., .but after that...we are loving them"
4.0,This is just as expected. It is very small in person. The gold tone color is a nice rich gold. The pendant is very lightweight. The stones on the pendant do not sparkle they are just white-ish. It's okay for the price. I wish I could afford real gold and real diamonds.
4.0,Granddaughter thought it fit weird!
4.0,Liked it.. just what I wanted but afraid the letters will eventually come off since they are stickers. Like it for now.
4.0,Overall I like these and will purchase again. What I learned:  Fit seems a little small.  I have a 36&#34; waist and would buy a large (rather than medium) next time.  Not as &#34;fluffy&#34; as I expected.
4.0,"Normally, I do not write reviews but this dress really impressed me. The material is thick but stretchy. The trim is so pretty. I am 143 lbs 5'3&#34; and ordered a size 8. I am more top heavy (36D) than the model pictured but since the material gives a little, it worked out. One will definitely need to wear a strapless bra with this dress."
4.0,"I loved the gown, but it was just too largel"
4.0,Ran a bit large.
4.0,"Pretty cute, some of the ends are a little rough so they hurt a bit while putting them in. But it’s just the tip.... would buy again. Very cute."
4.0,This is a cute dress but was not forgiving with my tummy rolls. Would need to wear some kind of shape wear - probably spanx rather than something more lightweight - in order to look nice. Sadly will be sending back until my fat magically disappears.
4.0,Good quality! It was just way too hot for me when I was pregnant!
4.0,"Gives a casual look a little more flair! The material is quite thin and definitely won’t protect you on a windy day, so will best be worn on a slightly cool or fall day. I don’t like my coats/jackets too tight, so I sized-up to a large, which still fits like a medium. Seems well made and has made it through 2 washes with no damage. Good value item!"
4.0,The snaps need to be red aswell
4.0,well made! just a little big<br />good quality tho
4.0,Just as shown in the picture. Fabric is a bit thin and a bit see thru. So wearing the necessary undergarments is a must.
4.0,"These are pretty good for inexpensive, ankle-high, thicker socks.  But they don't hold up for daily wear with combat boots. For that, you'll have to break down and buy the Injinji versions.  I would still recommend these for less demanding purposes.  Machine wash and air dry -- it helps them last longer."
4.0,"I loved, only problem is that it irritated my neck, besides that I liked a lot"
4.0,I’m on the second to last dot.
4.0,"When comparing similar products you have to remember this watch is not a G-Shock, though it does carry the ""Tough Solar"" label.<br />Solar power means no batteries to be replaced. It's got good basic digital watch features.<br />It's a very good watch for the price, but it is a cheap watch: The stainless steel is not solid and it sounds and weighs like plastic (though it is not). The light is a small orange LED on the side (not backlight like on newer models)"
4.0,I got the size suggested and they are little baggy. I would order again and size down
4.0,Loved the pendant.  Chain skimpy.
4.0,"I belong to a community farm project.  I'm always looking for ways to  keep the back of my neck protected from the blaring sun.  This coverup cap works well.  I thought I'd never be using the front price but last weekend we took a trip to the desert and bingo - the front snapped on and I was ready for the wind.  Momma may have looked funny but I was protected from the elements.  Snap it on, snap it off.  Both ways work when you need protection."
4.0,Those little bastards hurt if squeeze it a little bit too hard lol.
4.0,"Looks great, feels great. The inside is particularly soft and luscious.<br />That said, the touchscreen sensitivity is far from perfect. Also, these aren't very warm; unsuited to below freezing weather."
4.0,"I got this to wear to a wedding, but I won't wear it.  I am 5'5 and got a small.  It's really short and moves alot so I don't want to have to keep adjusting it all night.  It's a great Vegas or holiday fun party dress."
4.0,"Love the style, but a little small. Had to exchange it for a larger size"
4.0,"I love this open skirt, but the size chart is off. I ordered a small since my waist size is a 27 in. and the one I got measured at 24.5in."
4.0,"I like this ankle bracelet but the way it dangles is awkward , does not always drape on ankle as picture shows but still cute."
4.0,I loved this dress! It looks a bit different than the picture- minor details and slight color change. But overall a good purchase!
4.0,Liked it but was a little too small.
4.0,Product was durable.
4.0,Fit tighter than expected. But this item came exactly as described.
4.0,Good quality. Was hoping that it would have a rubber lining on the inside but it didn't. I still use them everyday but would love a rubber lining.
4.0,"I've worn eyeglasses pretty much since I came out of the womb. I'm also very light sensitive and live in a sunny climate, so some kind of shades are pretty much necessary.<br /><br />I've been using clip-ons, and I like them. However, they require a bit more time putting them on and taking them off. I also worry that the clips might scratch or otherwise harm the plastic lenses on my eyeglasses.<br /><br />This product is much easier to put on and take off. I also think they look more stylish, and I don't have to worry about them harming my lenses.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with them is that they are so dark that I have trouble seeing my dashboard. Other than that, these are a good choice. I still, however, plan to keep my clip-ons."
4.0,"As expected, seems to be good quality."
4.0,"Arrived within just a few days of ordering. I ordered a medium. I am a size 6-8. This will probaby worj for the one night I need it, but would probably be more comfortable in a large. Especially since the sequence is a bit scratchy. It's also a little transparent, so plan to wear a solid layer underneath."
4.0,"I'm about 5' 11&quot; , 235lbs, athletic-medium built and the XXL was a great choice. It fit awesome and best of all I could kick and stretch in it too, but still had to be careful not to rip it taking it off from my shoulders because they are broad.The mask fit okay, but I can't see out of the eyes very clearly. I may have to cut the white part of the eyes out and change that fabric material only.  A small modification.The belt looks and fits great too. The leg holster is ok if you are going to use a very small toy gun. The color of the suit is also a bright red, but that's fine with me because I want to be spotted right away and stick out too when Halloween comes around."
4.0,ZLove the quality of bag. Has a tight opening tho.
4.0,"Love these joggers, they ran a bit large but not enough to warrant an exchange. They are not see through and totally comfy for lounging or working out. A great dupe for Lulu align leggings - they are a bit more satin-y than the aligns but so great."
4.0,"It generally does the job and makes walking outside in the winter more bearable. Sometimes some water droplets form on the glasses and it can be a bit spolchy, but it makes life easier for us glasses wearers."
4.0,Stays on my face over my N95 mask. 3 more masks and fire to be safe.
4.0,"Fabric and color were nice. Unfortunately, had to return. I am a bit chesty (34G) and this altered the fit too much to keep."
4.0,"The zipper broke the first time I put them on, and the stitching on the knee is coming apart. Aside from that, they fit well and look good, so I'm pleased overall."
4.0,"love this shirt... giving it a 4 star only bc it's very short in the plus sizes... layering with a tank underneath fixes this issue, and I don't let it stop me from wearing it"
4.0,I really like the bracelet for the price. The stone chips are polished beautifully.  I wish that it wasn't strung together with plastic stretch cord.  In time the cord will lose it's elasticity and break.  I would prefer wire to be strung through the chips and clasps.
4.0,"I normal wear a medium, 8-10, but the dress was too small in the bust area. The large fits well. Dress is as beautiful as pictured."
4.0,looks great so I ordered in  larger size .Smashed my size Ds. Medium way yo tight on top Very pretty not for heavy women though Shows all;
4.0,Great song battery life could be a little better but all in all very nice product for the price
4.0,Love the moisture wicking feature. The weather here in Cali can be brutal in the summer time!
4.0,Good looking boot. I like them with it's wet out and I don't want to damage real leather... Great value for the price. My zipper is on the outside (I'd prefer it on the inside). I replaced the insoles to provide a bit more support - these are pretty soft boots.
4.0,"Great fit,made well,and  easy to care for.AND GREAT PRICE."
4.0,"Really cute dress, but the back did become fuzzy because of my braids. They kept snagging the dress. This was after one wear."
4.0,Replacing the band on my Garmin vivo proofed much better with this product.
4.0,There are two broke buttons and only one replacement button.  Not sure what I will do yet.
4.0,"Beautiful colors, material is soft and lightweight, just a bit large around the waist.  Wish they had more colors. I would order another.  Received 2 days after I ordered"
4.0,I like it so far but haven't had a chance to take it up yet. We'll see how it hold up.
4.0,"I am a solid size 14, sometimes 12. I ordered the XL which is supposed to be equivelant to a size 14/16. These fit more like a size 10. I returned and ordered up to an xxl to see how those fit. The XXL is supposed to fit a size 18-20 and they were insanely tight. I have a fairly small waist and I couldn’t not even get them to button. Recommend sizing up multiple sizes."
4.0,"Read that this ran small so I ordered the XL and I love it! It’s light enough to stay cool and looks really cute too! Wish it ran a little larger. It’s a tighter fit so this wouldn’t work for everyone unfortunately. Overall, the fabric/style, price and delivery time were definitely worth the buy."
4.0,"Very Soft and Cute. This top is amazing! I ordered a MED in the heart pink color. for reference I am 5'6'', 135lbs and wear a 36A cup. It fits comfortably and the color is true to the pictured color. I will probably be wearing this as a casual top as well as working out."
4.0,I would suggest ordering one size up as the suit is cut a bit snug.
4.0,We will see how long it lasts.
4.0,"I had a problem with my original band,which wore out after 3 months' wear,so when I ordered this replacement ,I was skeptical . This band is large enough, and fit me better than the small band that was enclosed in the original package.Unfortunately,the buckle is silvertone and my watch  is dark gray stainless steel,but it really doesn't matter because I like the band color. I plan to order other colors."
4.0,"The key looked just like the picture. It was a little smaller than I pictured, but it was still very nice. Thanks."
4.0,"Family member suffers from severe narcolepsy.  Properly configured, this thing will shock you awake.  You just need to figure out the correct shock level and interval and increase of the shocks. You want something strong enough to get a person awake but not sow strong as to make them pull off the watch in a stupor and go back to sleep.  Also setting further shocks to increase in intensity but not so quickly as to again make a person panic and pull it off.  Set properly, one wakes up and thinks, I better get up and get into the shower before this thing hits me again.  Software is a bit of a bloated mess but it works."
4.0,Material is nice weight. Color is gorgeous. Runs large. Elastic waistband is comfortable. The wrap tie is long so it can be tied or bowed.
4.0,"So surprised when opened box, came packaged so well, fancy case, protective wrap! And they fit wonderfully and I have a smaller head size. Gorgeous on! Love. Might buy another color! They even looked good on my husband and daughter. Definitely multi use!"
4.0,"This sunglasses are nice, but I feel like they are small.  This may be because I generally lean towards larger, chunkier framed glasses.  That being said, my teenage daughter likes them, and will be wearing them.  They go on very smoothly, and are very lightweight."
4.0,"These are fine, but are a little short and difficult to adjust. Other than that, they should do the job. Seller sent discounted item for review."
4.0,"Beautiful color, but sleeves are very hard to keep unwrinkled because of the material.  Still a beautiful shirt."
4.0,"Thought they  felt to small as i was putting them on there very snug  i like that no wiggle room feel nice and light then the temp's go up  not going to be  an issue with these gloves, very breezy with good amount of padding for a full grip did 20 + miles  they work great  and another feature is that there is some grippy layer on the palm a friend also liked them. will up date in a month or so after a trip to vultures  knob will test these gloves."
4.0,Bought this product for my daughters who run in all kinds of weather and fits them perfectly
4.0,great summer dress
4.0,"These were a little difficult to set up, but once I did it for my kids, they were able to use them on an every day basis."
4.0,"The owner/user is very pleased. The colors were carefully selected to match chosen garments which we are certain was the intention. Thanks to designers, craftsmen and al who contributed to its cuccess."
4.0,Earrings where larger than expected but I do like them. The color matched a coral necklace to a T.
4.0,"Be careful with the first wash, the T shirt takes on even the mildest of dyes from other clothes."
4.0,It serves the purpose. Slides down on face but not a lot. fits securely. No real complaints though.
4.0,It's exactly as it is in the photo. It's a little disappointing for $30 considering you can probably make it at home. I understand that it's a intellectual property but it's still pretty expensive for a sheet with patches.
4.0,I like the top very much.  It is very comfortable very &#34;slouchy&#34;---
4.0,Looks very little like the photo. I think it looks better than the photo. It is mostly tourquoise with black and is maybe 6 inches shorter.
4.0,"Originally ordered a large cause that’s usually what I fit in most swimsuits.  The top was really big on me (I have small boobs lol).  I reordered in a medium but was worried the bottom would be too tight.  To my surprise, it fit really nicely.  The top was still an odd shape for me tho.  Like it’s too wide where I feel I might have a nip slip.  Haha I haven’t used it in the water yet, so hopefully it stays in place.<br /><br />I also didn’t like the small round cups that it came with.  It was a really weird shape and felt like it needed to be adjusted often.  I threw them away and put in the triangle cups from an old bikini top I had which made it look better."
4.0,My 3 year old daughter loves this apron. Shes tall so it actually fits perfectly. The only criticism I have is that the end of the straps are burnt so they don't fray. I understand why this is done but it leaves the end looking dirty and brown. It's not a huge deal though since it's going to get messy in the kitchen anyway 😂
4.0,"I love my boots. Bought a black pair and they've been amazing in this wild Boston Winter. Feet always toasty and warm. Walk on campus all the time so it has been through a LOT of snow. Just didn't give 5 star because it takes such a long time to lace it, unless I put the laces in every other hole. Wish it had a zíper!!!! Plus some of the fur started coming out because of puting the lace all the time. That's why I gave 4 stars.  Otherwise it's really cute and does its job!"
4.0,"This product arrived on time and fits just fine. It looks exactly as pictured except a bit more green toned, which is what I was hoping for when ordering it in the color mint. My only complaint is that the skirt part is a bit short for my liking, so I usually pair it with leggings. All in all, worth the money."
4.0,It's not as long as I would hope.  It is very comfortable. I was hoping to wear leggings with this but due to the length that won't happen
4.0,Love it! Very fast shipping.
4.0,"I love this suit (got matching top as well) because it’s comfortable, has a cute cut, and fits perfectly. I also really liked the colors and print of the fabric. So I was super disappointed to find that after wearing it in a hot tub ONE time, it had drastically faded, especially the purple parts of the pattern. Previously I had worn it in both fresh and salt water with no problems, and I have worn other swimsuits in the same hot tub with no fading issues. So if you get this suit, either be prepared for some fading, or make sure not to ever wear it in a chlorinated pool or hot tub!"
4.0,"A wonderful set of durable fashionable bracelets. As I wear more expensive bracelets on the weekend, I bought these to wear at work during the week. And seeing that I work in an industrial environment, these little babies have held up very well."
4.0,"The quality of this 14 pack order was not as good as the last order, but checking them and pinching them where necessary makes them work well."
4.0,"Constructed very well.  Granted I will never be able to wear them.  They are impossible to put in yourself.  I had to have my boyfriend put them in for me, with a pair of pliers."
4.0,The Dial is not centered but overall a good and nice looking watch.
4.0,Pricing was great.
4.0,ended up returning because it was not wide enough but was made well.
4.0,It looked stunning on my baby.<br />I’m searching one for my elder kid too
4.0,It’s a cute bracelet especially for the price. Doesn’t look like a real jade bracelet but I do get compliments on it. It also feels very study like it won’t be breaking anytime soon. I guessed my wrist size when I ordered and it fit perfectly. It did take very long to come in the mail but it was a nice surprise when it showed up because I had forgot about it.
4.0,Normal…
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8158d08d86d7e209c0bce668f91bb73b]] The color and shape is perfect. I tuck my long hair back so it fills in the neck space pretty well. You can't see my hair shape either so the material is pretty thick enough, but i don't feel terribly warm and I'm writing this in 109 degree weather lol. My eyelashes get squished into my eyes when i wear it however and so I tear up, may have to cut eyeholes. I can see through it just fine, a great upgrade from my homemade Plague doctor costume that used dark sunglasses and I wore that at NIGHT haha. You won't see fine details though, but if you're using this for a con like I am and you're just posing for photos and walking around the con, you'll be fine. Just move cautiously. It'll be slightly tougher for me because I'm wearing a mask over this but that's another story.<br /><br />The neck opening is rather loose and rolls up, shame."
4.0,The shirt fabric is thinner than I expected.  I wanted a long sleeve for warmth playing golf.  Otherwise it is a good value.
4.0,This is a cute coverup.
4.0,"These are really soft and comfortable. They run kind of big, so you may be able to size down. I am hoping they will shrink in the dryer."
4.0,it works off a sweat.
4.0,"Great for the price.  I have a bigger belly than I would say a booty and I had room in the belly, but they were still tight on the booty. I think it is because there is different material around the booty instead of just the regular cotton. Definitely worth the price, just size up."
4.0,"I suggest getting a size...maybe two sizes smaller for real compression. Otherwise, it just fits like a tank top."
4.0,Item arrived fast and as described. Refer to chart for sizing. I'm a regular XL but this sizing I'm a 3XL.
4.0,Got these for a Sunday School class and the kids loves the helmets as well as the lesson applied. Really helped.
4.0,Kids loves them and seems to walk around pretty balanced.
4.0,Very delicate but pretty. Need to wear with other chain bracelets. I have small wrists and ordered a size seven and it fits well. Great choice for someone petite.
4.0,"These are the cutest little rainbow gladiator sandals! My daughter is 3 and wears between a 6/6.5. These are a size 7 and you can see there is plenty of room to grow. I would definitely say they’re true to size.<br />The back zips up and down and that’s how you get your little’s feet in and out. My daughter tends to have narrower feet and I struggle with finding shoes to fit her. These are great! So, if you have littles with narrower feet these are excellent sandals. The zipper doesn’t go all the way down so if you have wider feet, you may have to wiggle back and forth.<br />The zipper isn’t easy up and down either. You have to be hard with it. So take great caution with your littles when zipping up and down to make sure their skin is clear from the zipper. For toddler shoes, this is can cause damage. So this is the only reason I give it 4 stars.<br />Otherwise? They’re cute! And perfect sandals for kiddos with narrower feet. Their feet won’t be flopping around."
4.0,Material seems a bit fragile but it’s roomy enough to carry all of my documents. Nice carry strap.
4.0,Great gag gift!!
4.0,GREAT DEAL WELL MADE
4.0,Bought it for my daughter and she likes it.
4.0,"Amazing product, definitely worth the money."
4.0,Amazing Ring. It is NOT hypoallergenic the cobalt is has is reactive.<br />Engraved and everything. Super shiny.
4.0,"Super soft and comfy, runs large"
4.0,"gave to my daughter., i am a small and she too, but it was a little tighter fit than i like.  BUT it is nice and pretty"
4.0,The dress is really pretty. My boob kept wanting to pop out the sleeveless side tho. Fit my shape nicely though.
4.0,"Great for the price. I'm now on my second band of the pck after a few months. The slide on the other band begin to tear after getting my watch snagged on something, the silicone likes to stick to everything."
4.0,"I want to give this dress 5 stars but I cant. The sewing on the the one strap was bad (see picture) but PLEASE take note the purple isnt purple.....its cranberry/wine/burgundy but NOT purple!!!! Its the same color as the one that's shown as burgundy.  VERY DISAPPOINTED,  the color just let me down and its false advertising.  My fiance thought it was different a little and I said well I'll but it and see ---> NOPE! Besides that I AM  5'1 123lbs I ordered a small but really needed a xsmall tried to re-order for over 2 weeks and  no xsmall to order.  This dress overlooking those negatives was INCREDIBLY  CLASSY and just wow!!!!! This was for graduation of residents becoming doctors! Work event and dressy. I added necklace earrings and boom. I will be keeping it because it just looked so good."
4.0,The fabric wasn't as soft as I was expecting but overall I'm pleased. I'm excited to wear it to see how it feels and fits.
4.0,"These thongs are super soft and comfortable!<br />I really like how they are seamless. You always need a few pair of seamless panties for when you wear tight pants or leggings.<br />The sizing and fit is accurate and as expected.<br />I took off a star because although the thongs are good quality, I just don't think the price for 3 pair is very competitive or that great of a value."
4.0,Beautiful. Runs small but love it.
4.0,"It's a little itchy, but I think I'll get used to it as I move it around on my wrist. It's durable (so far) but I gotta match it up with the few watch ""bodies"" I'll be wearing it with. Versatile, constructed well, comfortable (on MY wrist at least) & easy to keep clean. ALOHA!! Coz...."
4.0,"A bit long, but I like it. Will wear with heel shoes.  I have not worn it yet. (but have tried it on --fits well like shows in item picture. snug on top half but very flowy on dress part.  Has side pockets)."
4.0,"I bought 3 different colors in size medium from 3 different sellers.  I'm 5'3 115lbs and was looking for an oversized look like the picture.  This one was a tad smaller and shorter than the other 2 hence the 4 stars however I am still very happy. The material feels like a wool blended sweater, medium thickness.  I prefer the way it looks as a cowl neck as opposed to off the shoulder.  It is soft, warm and cozy and I would highly recommend it however if your looking for a more oversized look go 2 sizes up."
4.0,"quality isn't bad, works well for minimal uses. If you're to rough with them, the outter coloring will start to rub off. Not sure if it'll be the same for everyone, but was surprised my daughter could still use her phone's screen with them on"
4.0,"Nice watch.... a bit on the &#34;thick&#34; side.... also, I'm not sure if the band can be replaced, should it break or wear out."
4.0,It’s a little snugger around then I would have normally liked. I did size up so it wasn’t uncomfortable but still snug. It’s easy to use and It was comfortable enough to sleep in. Washes very well. I just toss it in with other laundry and dry it as well.
4.0,"The spider looks great. It's a bit fragile, but they were a succsess at our party."
4.0,Is very  thin good for summertime
4.0,"I usually wear a medium or large, so I ordered a size up because of the reviews. It’s honestly still kinda tight because the material is so stiff. Hopefully it softens up after a few washes. However, the design is awesome just like the picture. Debating on exchanging for an XXL."
4.0,Very nice durable belt. The buckle is attached with a screw rather than a hook and 2 little prongs. Looks nice and the buckle itself is nice.
4.0,"Soft,  stretchy material.  Comfortable."
4.0,I  really  like it I expected a cheap looking suite based on the price but it looks great I just wish I could have bought the pieces separately as I really need a small bottom n medium top<br />I'm 5 6 about 120 pounds 34c and the top is pretty tight
4.0,Pretty and well made but the color is not like the picture. It’s more like a light pink.
4.0,"Fits good but is extremely wrinkly coming out of the dryer, must iron the wrinkles out."
4.0,Quality not the same in terms of sheepskin lining as my previous uggs and a bit heavier than similar boots bought at Nordstroms last year. That said they are comfortable.
4.0,"This is a really interesting piece. It does have some substantial weight to it. I am a larger girl, so I realized it wasn't going to fit like it does on the model. I chose to hike up the neck chain and pull the v neck above my chest and up closer to my neck... I am short waisted, so by doing that, the dip at the bottom, on the lower end in the front, hung just below my torso. I plan on wearing it over a teddy for a boudoir shoot. I do have to add about a 4-5"" extension chain so I can hook it in the back, due to my size. There is a drawback... it will get stuck on any kind of a knit, or lace fabric, so be aware of that."
4.0,"So. It's cute, and cozy, and becoming a go-to. But the picture makes it look longer than it is. I thought it'd be a bit more tunic-y, like maybe mid to upper thigh length, but it hits right around my waist, which is a bummer cause I wanted it to cover my bum. It does have pockets but they're not big enough to fit a phone. Shipping was relatively fast considering it wasn't Prime and came from China. All in all not bad, but not perfect."
4.0,"This is a beautiful print and flowy material. However I used the size chart thinking a Medium would fit perfect (5'4&#34;, 150 lbs, 36B). Unfortunately the chest area of this dress is too small... I couldn't even wear my bra with it!<br /><br />Returning it for a Large."
4.0,"This was a gift for no actual reason but it was a home run! My wife needed this type of bag for a very long time and has never bought one, so she dumped her other one immediately."
4.0,"Like how it fits, feels comfortable and not too thin. Has some substance to it. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the glitter rubs right off.  As a hairdresser, it's a perfect placeholder for work."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful! I am very satisfied with the quality just from opening it and putting it on. I wasn't expecting a loose fit since I have big wrists and no options for size were given but I'm surprised at how well it actually fit. Let's see how it withholds the test of time and wear. Didn't give 5 stars because I really wish they had an option to pick what size I could so it fit my wrist a little better. Will update review if anything happens to the band.
4.0,"I am pleased with the skirt and how it fits and looks.  The belt is extremely small, but the skirt looks ok without it!"
4.0,"A little flimsier then I would like, but still a very good product."
4.0,"So, I measure between the medium and large (going off of the seller's measurements for the sizes), but ended up buying a medium. It is definitely fitted, but not tight and a full slip does smooth things over. The straps are obviously too narrow to cover slip straps, but a black slip (to match the straps) actually does work with the dress, even though it has some light covers (plus there's shrugs to cover the straps). The material is very light and resists wrinkles. It is cheap material - although smooth and comfortable - and some of the seams don't line up perfectly, but it's still nice for the price and dressy casual stuff or even, maybe, with some good accessories, an outdoor summer wedding kind of event. The colors are nicely bright and even, as shown in the seller's picture.<br /><br />My one serious gripe is that the straps are very narrow, non-adjustable, and a bit stretchy. So, if they're not a perfect fit for you, they're useless. Personally, I don't want the bodice quite so low, so I ended up taking out a bit of the straps to fix that. If they were adjustable, it would have been a matter of seconds and I would be able to switch looks up a bit. As it is, getting the straps short enough took several minutes and it's permanently on the conservative side because that's more versatile. Yay."
4.0,The fit is as expected but the seller should consider a 7/8 length because they were pretty long on me. I’m 5’2” and about 140lbs and ordered a medium and they’re about two inches too long. (Unless they have that length and I just couldn’t find it).
4.0,"I bought this to use as a nose hoop and when I put it in, it was HUGE. Not good as a nose ring, so I put it in my tragus which is fine. great quality and fast shipping, just way bigger than I thought it would be."
4.0,the fabric is great. well made. only mistake I made was putting it in the dryer so now its incredibly short on me. I am 6ft and I liked the fit BEFORE I dried it as it is hard to find pants that are long enough as it is. But I highly recommend it. looks squat proof too because the material is super thick
4.0,We ordered a size up and the legs were still snug but the torso part was too long and caused sagging. It's well made but the fit isn't the best. It suited our purpose.
4.0,The product is fine-just not what I needed.
4.0,"The only thing that was different was where the “V” on the neck landed. It was actually about 3 inches lower, making it look very sultry."
4.0,"Was purchased for a wedding later this May. Looked very different in photo. Very informal, like Tshirt material."
4.0,"I chose the blue and yellow bathing suit and it's very pretty. The bottoms fit perfectly and are flattering, even after multiple c-sections and the rounded belly that can come with multiple pregnancies. The top is less than flattering for smaller breasts but I can see it looking good with those more blessed in that area."
4.0,"This swimsuit is so cute! It looks just like the picture. The only down fall is that it doesnt have a lot of support in the great area. It's a little shorter than I expected, but after all, it is a swim suit. The top, floral part is flow, and the suit is very comfortable."
4.0,Love it.  The fit is great and I get tons of compliments.
4.0,"Bought this but it was too big and clumsy for me (5'4"").  It was never used and I had to buy another one that fit me better.  Otherwise, it would have been a great bag."
4.0,I wear this several times a week. Just wish the initial in the center wasn't such an obvious sticker
4.0,"Looks small, butt very cute. Colored is vibrant. My teen will love it for Christmas."
4.0,fairly nice
4.0,"It is a little snug but cute and quite pretty.  With Amazon and it's many varied suppliers you just can't take any sort of normal sizing convention at its word like extra small or medium whatever . You have to actually look at the specs like what the bust size is , the waist, and make sure it's going to fit you along those numbers, oops I forgot . still fits and still awesome I might have gone one size up though"
4.0,"For the sale price of $2.99 and free shipping, I am very satisfied with this piece. The positives: it is cute; in a soft, neutral colour (beige) so it can go with a number of outfits; the floral shapes appeal to my feminine side; it looks good against my brown skin; and it's unique looking. Negatives: the chain is not too long, so may not fit someone with a thick neck comfortably. Overall, a good buy for me."
4.0,The Geneva brand provides great jewelry selections for the price range.  I like the look and function of the Geneva selections that I purchased.
4.0,It's only been a few weeks.Not sure how long it will last.<br />Almost as thick and sturdy as I remember...But still a good product.<br />We will see.
4.0,"I bought these for my family for our flights to London & Paris in a few months. We've already tried them out just hanging out on the couch and they are quite nice. We'll probably look like fools on the plane, but at least we'll be comfortable. I didn't notice any odd smell that other reviewers mentioned and the hood helps block out noise if you're trying to sleep. For me the only negative is the fact that you have to carry them when you're done... they don't deflate, so you can't just throw it in your purse."
4.0,It is a bit too big for my small wrist  and I'd requested a small band.  It's beautiful otherwise.
4.0,Love this. For the price it is great. Easy to fasten.
4.0,Sole was narrow but still wearable.
4.0,A little short but love the style! and fabric is great :)
4.0,Have enjoyed these gloves!  I like the feel and the ability to pick thinks up.  Just wish the palm of the gloves was better.  I feel that I will burn through this pair in a month of so.
4.0,Looks like the small version of the pineapple pendant from Maui Divers jewelry store; not as good quality but very reasonable. The crystal has a small patch of “hyperpigmentation” that I found noticeable-see photo- so I deducted a star.
4.0,"The quality of the material is good, but it is too tight around the neck and face."
4.0,"Nice color, design with pockets, a nice addition. Easy care. True to size. Good price"
4.0,"Love the dress and quality. I have a DD chest, and its a little tight up top, but wearable."
4.0,"The bodice and sleeves are MUCH tighter than I expected. From reading other reviews, I thought it would fit better. I got the XXL and I'd say it fits like a size 16 blouse. It's beautiful and well made of very nice fabric, but I've got to lose some weight before I wear it. I'm 5'3&#34; and weigh 190."
4.0,"A lot more see through than I thought, but otherwise great"
4.0,"They were just beautiful, even prettier than I expected. Gave them as gift and she loved them as well!"
4.0,"It went on easy and looks great. Only problem I have with it is the controller skin, doesn't fit the controllers so it must be for older model ones."
4.0,"These are a fun item that my son bought for a friend's birthday gift (a girl).  They were larger than I expected, but seemed to be pretty good quality and everyone was happy."
4.0,"Very pretty, flattering and so soft."
4.0,Fits just right not too tight very good for long standing easy to clean
4.0,"Purchased this dress for the wife based on the picture.  When she puts it on, it makes her curves stand out just right.<br /><br />Guys - this is recommended for that stylish - YOU LOOK GOOD GIRRRLLL - cost effective dress.<br /><br />Can be worn with leggings also.."
4.0,"I bought this necklace because I needed a black necklace.  It is very nice quality, I wish it was a little bit longer. If it was 20"" it would be perfect.  I do recommend it."
4.0,"Just ok, was going for a better quality of garment for the price. should be $8 cheaper price point"
4.0,The fit is just fine and I like the panoramic view. I am impressed that even with a fairly large curved lens there is minimal if any distortion.<br /> For repeated cleaning I would consider something with a liquid like Brilliant to help avoid scratches long term.<br />It is a little tight to easily put the glasses in an out of the drawstring bag without touching the lens.
4.0,These were a really cute substitute for cupcakes for my daughters birthday! A lot of the smiles fell off instantly but the children didn't care!
4.0,This is indeed a beautiful skirt. A little small in the waist though.
4.0,"Overall comfortable, but big."
4.0,Solid helped separate different keys in my department
4.0,"Head band too small, fit for female or teenager not a grown man."
4.0,"These NIMIN jogger pants look just as they do on the model in the Amazon image.<br /><br />The waistband is not too snug around my waist (for reference: 5’2” about 116 and I have a small waist); it’s above my bellybutton. I tend not to like pants hitting me high like that but in sweatpants like these I expected it.<br /><br />The waistband and end of the pant legs have colorful stripes—cute addition to otherwise pretty much boring gray sweatpants.<br /><br />The material is very soft, inside and out.<br /><br />The material is really THICK! These would be great for late fall and during winter. Not as much during the warm late spring  and not for  summer months as they’d just feel too hot. But they are going to be really cozy for winter.<br /><br />I’d wear these to walk for exercise in the cool/cold months, and as well I’d wear them around the house just to lounge around in. They aren’t really the kind of pants I’d wear anywhere but for lounging or walking exercise. They’d  be too hot for jogging, unless it’s super cold outside. And they are too thick for aerobics—I just did a workout in them and was way too hot; had to pull up the legs.<br /><br />They have two pockets in the front, and one small pocket in the back that’s a nice little detail.<br /><br />Most sweatpants are never going to be really flattering on. The top around the stomach area kind of balloons out unsightly but the rest fits fairly close to my body (loose but not baggy)—I was just reminded of gym teacher pants *laugh*<br /><br />They're fine. I will be warm in them for walks in the cold here in the Cove."
4.0,Nice. Could be thicker
4.0,The material was thinner than expected. This is a light hoodie - no fleece inside layer but it was still cute. My daughter wears a size 10-12  in girls and we got a medium. It fits well.
4.0,I like the pants. Nice quality and fit nicely except for the length. They are way too long. I’m 5’2” and they would be better suited to someone 5’6” or taller.<br />I will have to return them.
4.0,"They are made with good quality synthetic leather, but the took forever to get here and the Large wasn't big enough for my hand...and I have small, surgeon like hands. The seller did well, I wrote and they replied right away and I received my gloves the next day."
4.0,"Beautiful dress; color is a little off than what is in picture.  Fit a little big, but very pleased. Delivered within time they said. Would definitely recommend."
4.0,"Super cute top! It’s very soft and comfy. The crop is higher then I expected, several inches above my navel, but it’s so cute and flattering and comfy that I still love it."
4.0,For it being small it still did the job. This was my back up just in case my other bra did not come in on time but it was a good buy just wish it came in a bigger size.
4.0,I love these leggings but its a little tight fitting.
4.0,I bought this for my daughter to keep her swim goggles in. It's perfect for that. I wouldn't use it for my regular glasses though. It's big and they would move around a lot in it.
4.0,This is significantly more lightweight than other cooling towels.  It fits like a regular headband so It doesn't look awkward and it doesn't drip water on your shirt.  It does stay cool for a while but in one night at the concession stand I had to rewet it several times.  I do use it every time though and I bought a second one.
4.0,"My sister loves this loose, the only inconvenience that has found is that it is very hot according to her so it will be perfect for winters"
4.0,great replacement part!
4.0,soft and nice on little ones feet
4.0,aesrdtygukjl;
4.0,Light weight and comfortable.  I like all the padding points.
4.0,"Shirts were great quality, just were a little too small for my liking.  I took the advice already listed that the shirts ran smaller in terms of size.  I am normally a medium and don't like workout shirts that are too tight.  I ordered and XL but am planning to return and request an XXL instead.  That's quite a large jump in sizing, but I really liked the shirts."
4.0,"As far as fit, these replacement band is great.  The only complaint that I have at this point is that the clasp that was painted black scratched off in about 3 days.  Right now the color is gray, which isn't a big deal, but it did not say black as intended."
4.0,Awesome shirt.  Good quality fabric.
4.0,"I love the mask but the nose part is upside down. When you wear it properly the flag is upside down. The Pan African flag is red, black and green. You should fix this"
4.0,It’s a shade lighter then a cardboard box and NOT ARMY GREEN. I’ll keep it bc the size is correct and the pant I’m pairing the shirt with arrived today.
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my maternity shoot. XL. Great material. The lave overlay was beautiful.  The actual print was white and the netting appeared to be vintage white.<br />The sleeves and length were perfect. I was barefoot for tge photos however had a worn a flat or small heel there would have been a reasonable amount of material left in length...<br />I am 5&#34;3 , 200 lbs and very pregnant.<br />The only complaint I have is that the zipper gets caught and is cheap for the dress.<br />Reasonably priced and definately worth the investment"
4.0,"this is a sheer soft color combo, and was lovely on."
4.0,cute socks but somewhat thin. wish material was thicker.
4.0,"These gloves are good, especially for the price.<br /><br />WARMTH: ""-30°"" is, as you probably guessed, an exaggeration. I never really expected these to be good for -30, but I was hoping they'd be warmer than they are. I find them comfortable down to about 20°F. Today was 15° and I found my fingers hurting from the chill. So I consider these gloves ""just okay"" as far as warmth goes. I was hoping to finally find a pair suitable for northeast winters, but the search continues. I have not yet tried adding liners underneath, but that's definitely the route I will need to go as the temperature drops further.<br /><br />FIT: I recommend going up a size, based on their chart. My palm circumference is about 7.5 inches, which puts me in the ""small"" range. Since my fingers are longer than the small, I got the medium, which fits quite well. It's snug enough that I would definitely not want the tighter size.<br /><br />DEXTERITY: Again, these are ""just okay"". Not bad but nothing special. The fingers are a bit fat, but it's par for the course for winter gloves this thick.<br /><br />TOUCH COMPATIBILITY: the pointer fingers and thumbs are touchscreen compatible and work reasonably well. Typing is awkward, but I'm able to enter my phone's unlock PIN, open Google Maps, and navigate around without removing the gloves.<br /><br />COMFORT: The inner lining is very soft and comfortable. This is the best part of these gloves.<br /><br />DURABILITY: I've only been wearing these for a week so far, so I can't really say. Seems okay so far.<br /><br />I have not yet used them in heavy rain so I can't comment on the waterproofing. They do block wind perfectly well,  though."
4.0,I'm very pleased with it! I just wish it was a bit cheaper :) definitely very useful for a college student.
4.0,love it needs other color
4.0,decent suit
4.0,Reached my calfs
4.0,Very nice looking piece of jewelry.....well worth the price!
4.0,This hoodie is the best very comfortable and looks nice. I did not want a hoodie that looked like a guy hoodie on me. I'm currently expecting so I needed something that would accommodate my belly and all. This hoodie is great to wear indoors and outdoors.
4.0,Just like it says. Will do the job at a good price. Could be a little longer.
4.0,"The dress is very comfortable and looks exactly as pictured.  It does run a little small, so I would go up a size."
4.0,Very much adorable but it can fall over a lot cause the ears are heavy so you have to readjust sometimes
4.0,Very small but pretty. The silver scroll work was nice.
4.0,Looks as shown. Elegant. Doesn't at all appear cheap.
4.0,It was a bit big
4.0,"You get what you pay for.  That being said I like it.<br /><br />Issues:  Thin, cheap material.  Not sewn the best.  Stitching in many, many areas have loose ends....which is annoying.<br /><br />Likes:  Looks pretty good and comfortable.<br /><br />That being said, I might get the white one....except for the fact that it hasn't gone through the washer many times....and thinking about it....it might just completely fall apart."
4.0,"Great feel, soft and smooth to my skin.  Just order down a size. I ordered a large ad it is to big.  However, I kept it and will order another in medium."
4.0,Sound is muffled and not compatable with to all  charger cords.
4.0,"Very sturdy, nicely made.  We had to return because my daughter opted not to keep her piercing.  Not too big - feminine in size."
4.0,I was looking for a alternate to highend overly priced polarized sunglasses. Well these exceed my expectations!  I would MOST definitely recommend purchasing these sunglasses and  I love mine.
4.0,"It fits as expected. Maybe a bit bigger. The straps aren’t adjustable but it creates no problem. My only complaint about it is that it’s a bit see through so it requires a skip dress under. Otherwise, I love the dress!"
4.0,This is a fun little bracelet for the summer.  It reminds me of the kind we'd make as kids with beach shells (or even cereal).  It's on a stretchy string so it will fit everyone.  If you're looking for a casual piece of wrist candy that won't break the budget then this line of affordable jewelry from Glitziest will let you purchase 3 or 4 or more.<br /><br />This choice is one of many.  It has tiny cowrie shells  in a turquoise color that is always popular.  It's really cute.  BTW - I've seen similar items at some of the trendy shops in Newport for 3x the price-point.
4.0,"I love the ring, I wear it every day and it looks like the first time I wore it, definitely would purchase another one!"
4.0,"This was great quality for the price. It just wasn't what I wanted. I was hoping it was more form fitting, but it's definitely loose. I think I only wore it once."
4.0,"Love the slim fit. Hate that it sliced through the rubber band after one week, BUT they replaced the bans free of charge.<br />I just used a couple pieces of tape to cover the edges where the band rests."
4.0,the quality is not so good. After wear it 3 times I have to throw them because there are wholes on socks.
4.0,The only thing I don’t like is they roll down.
4.0,Somewhat small because it was a bit narrow . It's is a very neat and adorable sandal. I love it. Will have to let my son wear this right away before it no longer fits
4.0,"While the fabric is a cheaper synthetic it looks a lot like linen. Screen printing is raised/textured. Got the XL and its just right. I am a 36DD 8/10 pant 5' 1"". I do have a curvy figure, the top does taiper in at the waist and is a great fit for me. Is shorter. Front tie hole hits my belly button and im petite. Has additional stitching detail on the front and back i didnt notice in photo. Definitely looks more expensive than it is. What you see in photo is what you get with this one. 10 stars, love it!<br />I want to update, I washed and the fabric hot so nice and soft (pretty sure its linen,) but it shrank big time. I would say the xl is better suited for a narrow chest shoulder measurement and smaller arms, maybe a sm-med. Can get on over my 36dd but only with compression. Dont dry if it's a tight fit."
4.0,I am using it in Italy right now and it packed easily and it looks great.
4.0,It is kinda hard to use them.  But they are comfortable.
4.0,They were everything as described and seem to be put together well.  Good product.  I would purchase again.
4.0,"It's a little bigger around the waist than I was hoping, but still fits better than most other slim fits I've tried. Maybe I should just put on weight."
4.0,"I like to wear clear or amber glasses when bicyling at night or early in the morning. In the past, I've ordered a different brand from Amazon. That brand was no longer available when I needed a new pair, but this option popped up when I searched for that former brand.<br /><br />I think these glasses will perform similarly to the brand I'm used to. Doesn't seem to be of any better or worse quality. Worth taking a shot at this price."
4.0,"I hope the stretch will keep it's shape. So far, so good. Have worn them twice."
4.0,Really cute little bag for taking your most essentials out of the big purse and go on a quick shopping trip or hike.  My only problem was the pattern isn't always what you get.  My first one was all white with just a few black dots of the pattern and I returned it.  My second one is more of what is shown.  I did spray it with ScotchGuard to protect the color from getting too dirty.  So far so good.  The belt portion is made fairly well for the price.  I like it!
4.0,"This hat is well made and I like it, but here in AZ I could use an even wider brim!"
4.0,"The dress has a thin, T-shirt material type feel - not what I expected. It is cut narrow along the hips so it fit tighter than I wanted it too- maybe size up. If I would have tried on in store, I wouldn’t have bought it. I can still wear with a vest over it."
4.0,Like material but graphics could be larger and better detail
4.0,"The fabric,is,more silky than expected but the print is crisp and nice. Its a little,bigger Than expected too, it will allow my son to grow with it."
4.0,It's really pretty and delicate. I'm scared to put it on 😅 my fault by reacting to only the photo. So good job on marketing lol. My man is Omega psi phi and I want to have some accessory that complement him during events.
4.0,"This hat is really cute and works well enough in chilly weather.  I have to pull it down to cover my ears which then pulls the front almost over my eyes. Therefore, wearing it weather where you don't need your ears covered all of the time is preferred.<br /><br />Overall: The hat is stylish and cute, but if you need something to wear in COLD weather, stick to the standard winter hat that covers your ears without covering your eyes!"
4.0,"Love this dress and fits perfectly and true to size. It's thin, but not see through. Perfect for the wedding I'm going to."
4.0,"I really liked this shirt. it fit well, looks nice and good quality. The only issue I had, was the writing was pink not white. But not a huge deal. I also left the sting going across the chest area off, because it made the shirt bunch up weird. Overall I love it."
4.0,"Cute and comfortable but, I had a bit of sizing issues."
4.0,"These keep the suns intensity down, but when using them while driving, I have to flip them up so I can see things on the dash.  Reading the speedometer is fine, it's the clock an climate control stuff I have difficulty seeing, this is with all the vehicles I use them in."
4.0,"I ordered these for my daughter & her friends as they have a thing for piercings at the moment & well at 15-17 compromising with fake ones is better than them finding someone to agree to give them the real thing right now! haha! Long story short, they LOVED them! They are durable & don't fall off all of the time. The girls had no problem keeping these on. I do recommend having them take them out before going to Grandma's house as Grandma does not find these amusing at all! They are especially great for teenagers who change their &#34;trends&#34; every 5 minutes rather than going to get holes poked in them that they arent 100% sure they want for the rest of their lives. I admit they are fun for adults too!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00VY22KU6 8pcs Clip on Non-pierced Hoops Fake Nose Lip Ear Rings Earrings Piercing]]"
4.0,"Wanted this for my sons costume, but they kept falling off his nose and he couldn't see very well with them.  If the width would be a little smaller, it would've been perfect.  They are more for an adult."
4.0,"Works great for preventing the key bulge in my pocket. It is a little bulky when full of keys, I will likely look for a wallet style key holder next time that can hold two key fobs next to each other rather than back to back."
4.0,"Very pretty, reasonably priced ~ fit is actually very good for a mail order tunic, fits true, fairly well made, nice bright spring color, and made of a light easily washable fabric."
4.0,"The size was off a lot. When I wear them, they are tight"
4.0,"It is a cute bikini, the reason I don’t give 5 stars because of the color"
4.0,2 of them for my bf has ripped in the crotch area. I had to sew them but he loves them
4.0,Was a littely bigger than I expicted
4.0,I ordered this as a dress to wear around the house during the hot summer months.  I'm glad that's all I ordered it for.  It actually looks more like a nightshift than a dress. The material is soft and it is comfy to lounge in
4.0,Same as the picture. I wanted something plaid and red and that’s what I got
4.0,"Was a bit skeptical at first but in the end it was definitely worth the buy. The ring looks nice and fits well. It is a comfort fit so do buy a bigger size, I usually wear size 7 rings but this was a tight fit. So I ended up wearing the ring on my pinky finger instead."
4.0,"I ordered this jewelry for a Christmas party. The jewelry arrived quickly and it was beautiful with the dress I ordered from Amazon. The set included the bracelet, necklace, earrings, and ring. It sparkled against the black lace gown. I would recommend this set. It is not bad for costume jewelry."
4.0,I like the feel Of the material. I like the Design but i think the size is smaller than i thought.
4.0,"I should have ordered the next size bigger.  I wear 12 normally, but ordered a 14.  I should have ordered a 16. Very pretty dress though and well made."
4.0,Pretty but the wire in back pokes in arm
4.0,was a gift. Not sure how it fits.
4.0,"I got it for my daughter.  Very cute and comfortable, the only down side was that the top elastic did not stay in place so it was not secure enough and when my daughter played in the snow, some of the snow entered the inside of the boot.  So the solution was not only to use the draw string approach but also to tie a knot!"
4.0,They are so adorable!  I love these and I totally love owls.  One negative is that on my of the backing of the ear rings was totally squished and not fitting properly to secure the ear ring. The almost caused me to lose one of the ear rings.  I changed out the backings it came with and used my own from Claire's.  No biggie but I wish it came with very secure backings on its own.
4.0,It's comfortable though a bit heavier than I thought. It also seems to run large.
4.0,"I have purchased eight of the Long sleeve everyday tee shirt. They fit as expected, they wash well and dry well. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. At times I wear a wet towel on my head that hangs down to my shoulders and on the tee shirt. It dries out very well and quickly. Even in 90 degree weather I did not get hot wearing these shirts. I will purchase more and also look at the polo shirts."
4.0,I wish I had went by my measurements and not by reviews. I went up a size an really did not need to. So u HIGHLY suggest you go by your own measurements.
4.0,"The graphics portion not as bright( it was dull) as I would as expected, as per the photo shown."
4.0,"The keyring is very nice.  I had no idea just how light titanium is.  The caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight, it's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed, making the ring kinda useless.  Definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it.<br /><br />Additinally, the metal is quite plyable and i've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys."
4.0,I love these ankles. They fit perfect andb I wear them all the time. They arrived quickly and ahead of the schedule time they quoted me.
4.0,"I think these are adorable and have bought them a second time (bigger size) for my 2 year old. The first pair she liked but happened to grow out of really quick. So I bought them again 2 sizes bigger (6 to an 8). She doesn’t want to wear them. She says that they are tight. I figured she was just remembering the previous pair and didn’t understand that these would fit fine. I’ve made her wear them a few times and she still calls them too tight. There is plenty of room in the toe box, but they are a bit stiff and I think they need to be broken in before they will be comfortable. But they are very cute for a great price and I don’t believe in buying expensive shoes for kids that will grow out of them in a few months."
4.0,"Beautiful look, wide waist, bought size xl"
4.0,I'm a starwars fan I really like the quality and details of my ring big heavy duty ring
4.0,"This bag is exactly as depicted. It's roomy, cute, light, and strong. I always receive compliments when I use it."
4.0,Really cute little shoes.  My son seems to be comfortable in them.  The only issue I have is the little orange tabs on the velcro straps are fraying a bit already.
4.0,The quality of material is good. The style is good.
4.0,really pretty but not quite as bright in person as in the pic.
4.0,Love love love very good construction great buy
4.0,"I use it anyways but my butt is too big for this, but order a size bigger. Quality is great but it runs small and that's why I'm giving 4 stars"
4.0,Loved it!! Fit perfect!!
4.0,Really liked the dress was just way too small probably should have went up two sizes.
4.0,"The comfort and feel of these yoga pants is amazing. The reason I don't give 4 stars is because they do not allow for airflow and my crotch gets hot and sweaty. The biggest problem for me is that because of this there is an odor, which I never normally have to worry about. The second pair I bought for my daughter and she complains about the same thing."
4.0,Exactly as described and arrived sooner than expected
4.0,I bought two of these tops in red and peach. The colors are beautiful I bought an x-l I uselly war at a 16 top.<br />It fits me well I probably could have gone up a size for a looser fit but this one is not tight.
4.0,"You do get three chains though they are 17&#34; not 18&#34;. The pendants are very pretty, not cheap looking. A good deal!"
4.0,This dress is nicely made! Very cute when matched with a sun hat! Going to return it and buy a medium. I am 5-9 and 145 lbs. Runs big!
4.0,Several different colors and styles. Super soft sherpa. 3/4ths zipper in the center chest area. Kangaroo pocket. Or hooded with no pocket. Winter must! So comfy! I found none of the negative review applications for the garment I received. I machine washed cold delicates and line dried successfully without deterioration.
4.0,"Very nice item. Material is very thin, but seems durable."
4.0,"In my opinion, the shirt runs true to size.  But I listened to the other reviewers here and got an XL instead of my usual large.  It was wayy to big.  I ordered another large one and it fit much better. I could have probably got away with a medium.  I weigh 160, 39 chest, 35 waist, 42 hips.  I'll try and shrink down the xl one.  The material is thin and comfortable, perfect for warmer days or just to lounge around at home.  I don't think it's very see through unless it's skin tight on you."
4.0,Bans are easy to install. Good buy for the money. After a while sometimes they may pop off mostly if you wear the band really tight on your wrist.
4.0,"My waist is 32 inches. I got the size 12. It fits great around the waist, but the thighs are super tight. Luckily they stretch enough that it still looks good. But if you have larger than average thighs, consider getting a size up."
4.0,Fit almost perfect!
4.0,Cool Ring! A bit ostentatious.
4.0,use it all the time. love it.
4.0,"I love pink. These are very comfortable, especially on the motorcycle and very sturdy. Great price. Very happy with purchase"
4.0,Well made and fit was perfect
4.0,Looks just like the picture. I normally wear an XL and ordered the same size hoping it would fit.  The fit is definitely smaller than US sizes. Material and construction look pretty good and it is stretchy so I am hoping I can stretch it to fit better.  Definitely would be better if it were longer. I am only 5'1&#34; and it comes to just above my waist.
4.0,Item was received and was as described
4.0,"I gave  them as a gift, then kept a pair . They seem to run small but are very nice!"
4.0,This may be the cutest thing I own. The cut is very forgiving of a not-100%-in-shape body and the material is comfy and light. I might buy all of the other prints and wear it everyday
4.0,The quality was very nice. The fabric very soft. But the size Large was very big for me. I think that I'm like an M size.
4.0,"I bought these for my wife because they have both our and our sons birth stones in them. Tad small, but for earrings that isn't always a bad thing. Very pretty. Recommend."
4.0,This doesn't feel like real leather.
4.0,I really like my new necklace but it is much daintier than I expected.
4.0,The dress is really cute & sassy but the size large runs really small.
4.0,The glasses arrived quickly and look wonderful (as pictured). It came just in time for a trip.  Great addition to my wardrobe.  I have no complaints about the structure or quickly. - Kay
4.0,Super cute. It's not too heavy and not overly Disney. My only issue is that the band stretches so the watch become loose.
4.0,"I just received my watch today, it is slightly darker than the pictures shown. Very light weight and quiet. My biggest concern is the band, it appears to be layered leather (sewn) and I am not sure how long it will last."
4.0,"Not the most comfortable sandals I've ever owned, but they're fine. They provide good arch support, but aren't super cushioning. Good for walking around the house, but I wouldn't want to wear them for 8 hours."
4.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; 155 pounds, and I ordered the XL. It was very close to fitting very well. However, if I put my arms straight forward, it was too smug in the back/arm area. I've returned it for the 2xl, it will probably be perfect. Otherwise, the coat itself is VERY cute. I think it looks like the picture. Plus I could tell it would be nice and warm. If you order a lot from Amazon like I do, you have learned if you order clothing from China, you need to order up a size, sometimes even 2 sizes. I think their sizes in China run much smaller than US sizing."
4.0,The fit is great and very comfortable. I am definitely keeping them. I am a little disappointed by the material. It seems a bit plastic looking. Not planning on returning them because they fit well.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:fea7771b88f2b014d7724d666588dd51]] Dainty and Cute. This ring is small but the rope detail is so pretty. The stone is vibrant. The gold  is shiny. Looks like it will hold up to daily wear.
4.0,"Good quality, fun design."
4.0,I’m 5’10” I wish it was a tad longer but it will do. Fit is good. Love the dress!
4.0,Pattern looks different up close.  I ordered a size up but it was too large so now I’m waiting on the right size to come
4.0,"I like the size of these earrings.  In fact, I had bought 2 other pair and had to return both because they were too small.  These are just right to wear as everyday earrings as they are not too ostentatious, yet could also be worn with dressier clothes,"
4.0,buy up a size as runs very small but whne it works nice product
4.0,"I am a size 14 and purchased this in a size 14 a my usual Lands End size. It fits easily everywhere except across my chest 🙃 I am in the process of losing weight and I expect it will fit in another month or two, so I kept it. It’s a really nice top. If you are between sizes, order up."
4.0,"Size and fit are really good. The green hat's color in the pic is muted compared to the actual hat. You should expect a bright apple green, literally just like the fruit. Once this hat fades some, it should be just about perfect."
4.0,It is high up on the neck the way I like my necklaces. It doesnt grab and hairs. It looks way more expensive than it is.
4.0,Dress is beautiful but the purse handle broke the first time it was used.
4.0,"The fit was comfortable, although the top section ended a little lower on my waist than I wanted and the color was decidedly teal, or at least a blue with very green undertones that weren’t apparent from the picture. I love the style and had others compliment the look, but be aware of the color distinction if you specifically need a blue dress like I did."
4.0,Shirt has good material and quality. Received it sooner than what was expected. Great to wear for casual or semi professional for work. I did receive this product at discounted rate.
4.0,Good fit and it’s warm
4.0,Ok so this is the second sweatshirt (from different brands) with this graphic on it I’ve bought. This one is better than the last…..but the material is not what I expected. It kinda feels like that spandex material on the front. Of course it’s not spandex lol but that’s the best way to describe it. It’s not that soft cotton sweatshirt that I was hoping for. The inside is soft and it is true to size so I kept it. I am still looking for a better version though.
4.0,"Really like the mom to the third power shirt.  Fit as expected but it has shrunk a little since washing.  But, quality seems good and its comfortable and light weight."
4.0,Nice material. Haven't gotten a chance to wear and can't wait
4.0,I love the Fit & cut  of this jacket. Very attractive!
4.0,"The bathing suit is very cute. A mix of pin up bombshell look with little girl looks. It's not for everyone. The husband said it wasn't quite my style, more too cute then sexy or functional. The bottoms were a bit bigger than I was expecting. Overall I like it."
4.0,"Beautiful blouse but shorter than I thought it would be on me so I had to return it. Also, somewhat thinner material. I could  see the outline of my bra through this when I normally don't with other plain colored blouses."
4.0,Not sure if it was 22 g but it was cute
4.0,This coat worked perfectly for my Cruella De Vil costume. I may even use it again for another costume or event. The quality was surprising.
4.0,"This hood is really soft and fuzzy and feels well made. I wore it as part of a costume in a drama. The hood is too small. It would fit much better on a child. For an adult it would be much prettier and more comfortable if it came to the base of the neck in the back, further forward on the forehead and connected with the button in front at the collar rather than in the middle of the neck. It has cute gray paw prints sewn under the pockets like a Spirit Hood."
4.0,Perfect fit. Could have had lining though as you can see through the material.
4.0,"Light weight , sturdy design, shank and toe protection . Used at nail strewn construction sites daily for over two years. Held up better than top end brand named work boots at 20% the price. Comfortably water resistant without sweaty feet . Order 2pair you'll wish you had. You'll see, these are my second pair of shoes ,I have the boots too."
4.0,"Purchased for my daughter. Sized up as some previous reviewers mentioned the shirt could be a bit tight. The one we got (size medium), ran large, but was easily fixed with a couple of safety pins. Other than a few loose threads (like they didn’t rim the extra threads off after sewing) this is nice quality."
4.0,Cheaply made masks but they work and are 3 layers
4.0,These bracelets are petite and dainty; perfect to buy in multiples for a stackable look. Very easy to wear.
4.0,They  good  and look good
4.0,"Dress looked great. I am a 36D, 190 pounds and XL fit just right. Slightly long but other than that dress is absolute perfection. Material is very thick so its not to be worn in super hot weather."
4.0,I do like the look. The silver accents are a great touch. I did not like how &#34;top&#34; heavy this watch is tho. I also do not like how I have to take it to a jeweler to remove links.
4.0,"The reason why I’ll give 4 stars is because the bow fell 5 minutes after my daughter has the dress on. Overall, the dress is so beautiful , I’ll recommend it."
4.0,It's a pretty color!
4.0,"Love the color , could have been little better quality. Order 1 size up."
4.0,"Love the way these feel, very comfortable"
4.0,"Nice jacket, but Its larger Than size chart numbers."
4.0,"These are the best ratchet belts I have tried.  I recommend paying attention to the people who said don't cut it too short.  I did when I bought my third one and I had to buy another one.  But if you do that, save the buckle.  The belts seem to last longer than the buckle."
4.0,"The shirt isn't super soft, but it's the perfect size and decent quality for the price. I bought it for Ren Faire and it definitely gets the job done!"
4.0,I just received this and tried it all on ...The necklace is a little tight and the color is a little red as opposed to the purple I was hoping for to match eggplant color.  I might still wear it because it's very well made for costume jewelry.  All in all you can't go wrong with this set for a dress up night!
4.0,"Love the purse. Nice material. Doesn't look cheap. Only down side, zipper broke after a week of use."
4.0,I have very large hands fit was great. Very comfortable
4.0,Shirt fit fine.
4.0,I typically where a large to extra large especially since I'm a dd in the chest so I got an XXL and it fit me great - my only complaint is that the first time I wore to water aerobics the colors faded and now it is a purple and green mixture of colors - the fuschia and pinks are now purple so not sure how chlorine resistant it is - I will keep wearing and update if anything changes - other than that I love the suit - the back is nice to adjust for better fit.
4.0,Very cute. My daughter just didn't like the fit. I was impressed with the structure of the dress. It's nice. The material isn't too thin. It's a nice dress. I'm glad we tried it - wish she would've loved it!
4.0,"The color of this shirt is really pretty and I love the design! I typically wear a 14/16, so I followed the size chart and ordered a 3x. I'm so glad I did! Even after ordering that, I feel like it could be a little bigger, but it still fits. My suggestion would be to pay attention to your size and the size chart."
4.0,"These run ever so slightly large, and get a little looser as the day goes on, so I would recommend sizing down one if your child is on the smaller side of their size.<br />They are cute, and a very good value for this price. My son loves outer space, so these undies actually helped him potty train faster because he was super excited about them."
4.0,"I like this hat, it fits good and the shape is just right. The hat band is hard to remove, I like to switch hat bands."
4.0,"Comfortable is the first thing that comes to mind while wearing these.<br /><br />Edit - Update June 17.2017: Today I went to the olympic pool to do some laps while trying these out and I have to say they are definitely comfortable to wear and very good keeping water out, specially the mounted ear-plugs protecting my eardrums whenever I go diving for more than 5 feets underwater. Now, there is a drawback I found while using them and it is everytime I went for a jump-dive they kept coming off, so they aren't really good for competitive activities. Regardless for casual swimmers they are sweet and really accesible.<br /><br />I have to deduct a star because of the given reasons."
4.0,"It's a good scarf. Larger and thicker than I thought, pretty heavy. It has a few stray strings but can be cut off no problem. The texture is not too soft and can get itchy if you are sensitive. Great for the really cold weather."
4.0,"Really nice, comfortable yoga bra. I bought it not so much to work out in, but for when i don't want to wear a regular bra or for wearing with tops that have cut out backs. I would wear it to yoga though, but not a high intensity workout. The material is nice, and the scrappy back is really pretty. The pink color is pretty close to a nude if you are caucasian. The size is about normal i'd say, but i don't think i'd put it in the dryer for fear of shrinking. Overall, good buy for the price considering Athleta or Lulu would be $50+. I also like that there are no seams on the bust cups so its smooth. Overall, great buy!"
4.0,"This is one of the better swimsuits that I've purchased on Amazon. My only concern is that because of the way the top is made you cannot adjust it vertically. Overall good material, minimal padding but a good fit. I'm 5'-3&#34; 125 lbs and ordered a medium."
4.0,This is a nice looking band.  It is comfortable to wear and is  a good deal for the price.
4.0,"The shirt is really nice and fits well; however, I was hoping that the overlay of the arms was a little bit longer and covered more of my upper arms.  Other than that,  I am pleased with the shirt."
4.0,"Bought for my wife, so she will do the review! Love the bag. Very well made and good material. Has lots of zippered and regular pockets both inside and out which is great to keep all my gym stuff separated and manageable. The straps do rub a little on the skin if you are wearing a sleeveless shirt. If you are going to be wearing it like that for a long period it might get painful. The main problem I have with the bag is that the side pockets do not hold reusable water bottles that have a diameter bigger than 2 3/4&#34;. Regular plastic water bottles fit fine and I found one slim reusable one that fits but anything slightly bigger (and most of my reusable bottles are) will not fit. It's not a deal breaker for me to send back but it is annoying that most of my bottles won't fit. I hadn't read any reviews that stated this and thought it was worth mentioning."
4.0,Very cool dress. Sorry I listened to the reviews and ordered up though. Would have been better off with my normal size small instead of the Med I got. I am 5’6 138lbs and a 34C. I am keeping it and I just need to take in the bust a bit.
4.0,Great synthetic leather watch strap. Fits the Timex Weekender perfectly.
4.0,Love these braclets. My wife really loves them as well. They aren't very durable.for the work I do but they are nice braclets
4.0,"The dress fits well, but it's a bit snug at the top so order up a size if you're in-between. The cut is really cute and girlie, but the material is very casual, so it's more of a house dress than going out dress. Well, maybe for a picnic."
4.0,This shirt was a foggy to someone else and they lover it.
4.0,Fit right to size. Just bought more. Wish they had colors other than black and grey.
4.0,Bought this for my husband when we got married. His shirt stayed put and did not slide. Worked out great for him. It’s adjustable for all sizes.👌🏼
4.0,I bought this for a superhero party--It was super comfy and cute. I would recommend getting a size up. I'm usually in between a M or L in tops (I like my clothes loose fitting so I generally choose the Large). I got this in an XL and it fit how I like it. It was still a little tight in the arms so I definitely won't be throwing it in the dryer.
4.0,These run very large. My 6 year old measures a 2.5 at the store. We ordered a 3 for a little room but they were so large he ran right out of them. Very nice shoes but you may not want to factor in that half size of growing room like you do with most shoe orders.
4.0,The compression socks work very well. I have to walk full day once a month for work reviewing building sites. I have used it for a full day of walking/standing and my calves feel much better than thighs.
4.0,"This is thicker and more shiny than I thought it would be but is heavy and looks well made. This was a very good deal and was purchased as a substitute for something similar my daughter wanted, but was out of stock. I would prefer something less shiny, but the final judgment of how fashionable and wearable it is will be hers!"
4.0,"Doesn't leak, so it does what I need it to do. I just wish the clips were a little easier to deal with. They over-rotate when open so it is hard to get them lined up to close the pouch. This is minor, but annoying."
4.0,"Very nice quality. I've got a broad face and they fit fine with no adjustment necessary. Case is a bit funky with a zipper closure, so I trashed that in favor of old cases I've got on hand. I ordered these because the ones I had didn't provide really good coverage. These are taller and wider and will be much better. The temples are spring loaded and have a soft-grippy tip. Nice overall."
4.0,"Bought a 39 for a size 8, but it was way too small. Fit snugly on a size 7.5 foot. Definitely size one whole size up to fit. But otherwise, very cute, and unique shoes.  The colors were very pretty. Would have definitely kept them if they fit."
4.0,I like the size and number of card pockets. The only small downside is that the coin pocket zipper has a zipper pull that is too small. Hopefully it won’t break. The card pockets are a little too tight but will probably stretch and be fine.  Glad I got it.
4.0,Perfect for Spring.  Made with lining which is great.  I cannot  say the fabric is a good quality but acceptable for the price.  The fabric was strechy just right amount.  But size seems to run small.  I need to exchange for  one size bigger.
4.0,"I like this sports bra but I wouldidn’t consider it to be high impact, I ‘d say medium impact at best. It is comfortable and the back is cute in cut out shirts."
4.0,Very pretty. Will be great this fall with a pair of leggings.
4.0,I got this for my mom for Mother’s Day and she loves it. She said it was really soft too.
4.0,Great value. Circumference is quite small if using on a larger wrist. May be uncomfortable and cut off circulation.
4.0,Awesome Hat
4.0,A bit too much bright yellow advertising. But easily taken care.
4.0,I love the saying. it’s acute shirt. not the best quality but for the price it’s fine. I don’t regret buying it
4.0,This was a gift to my girlfriend and she loved it!
4.0,I wish it was just a bit longer. Other than that I love it.
4.0,"The fit is slightly smaller than expected but does offer a soft cushiony feel. Myself, open backed slip ons are a challenge for me to not walk out if them. With that said, I believe the slightly smaller fit has actually helped with keeping them on my feet without doing the shuffle walk. A really well made pair, these would makes good holiday bonus gifts."
4.0,Fits a little close. Bout it's very nice. Will keep it.
4.0,nice lounge around t shirt.  i wear it often
4.0,"One of the features was slightly bent.  Though the item was nice over all, the feathers were not full and not without some fray at the tips.  The feathers on the amazon website were full and not curled at the tips."
4.0,"Ordered this for my mom, she loves it."
4.0,"I brought this thinking it was for my nose piercing I was a little disappointed, but I use it for my ear piercing instead so either way I didn't waste my money. Love the colors too!"
4.0,"This shirt fit a little larger than expected, but not bad. It's really pretty, loose & flowy. I like that it's flattering for a post partum body and also a stylish nursing top that doesn't seem like one. The color is nice and vibrant. I absolutely love that the back is a little longer to cover the bum. It works out great to wear with pants or leggings. Some cons would be that it gets a little staticky and also that the fabric is so flowy that sometimes my nursing bra or breast pad outlines stand out a lot and require adjusting. Overall I'm happy to find affordable, cute nursing tops and am glad to have this and another of a different color in my wardrobe."
4.0,The photo was a little misleading.  The contrast between the black and the gold is not as pronounced as it is in the photo.
4.0,"Cool design. Good quality. Not for small wrists, as the clasp will come open."
4.0,This fit great and looked really great. Only down side was even after i ironed it there was still a few wrinkles that seemed to not want to come out but not a huge deal.
4.0,"I liked the vintage look of the frames but, I loved the change from room lighting to a sunny day!No more digging for sunglasses."
4.0,Muy lindas… esperemos que dure un poco.
4.0,"Shoe sizes per style, though marked the same seem to vary widely these days; at least for my feet. And since I don't like to have ""to wear in"" a tight shoe, I bought these to slip over my toes. Especially makes my boots more comfortable, snug but not tight. They work great and seem to be constructed for long wear; worth the money."
4.0,"Does not keep it's shape as well as expected but still pretty.<br /><br />5'3, 155lbs, L"
4.0,Love these!  They’re the cutest and really don’t show.
4.0,Love this shirt.  Does run small
4.0,"Extremely comfortable!!! Probably my most comfortable NATO! The blue is more of a purple though, therefore only 4stars. But I am still digging it!"
4.0,I like this bustier/corset. It is not too thick but work well. The buckles will show if you don't wear a cami or something between it and your shirt. I love that it has straps for the arms. I feel lit helps keep it up and in place.
4.0,"Hard to write a review when I've only used them once. They fit my Ray Ban sunglasses and were easy to put on. They are lightweight and comfortable. They could however be slightly longer in length. Getting them over your head is a close fit. At least for me. Do they float, I don't know, I didn't drop my glasses in the lake to test them. Price was reasonable."
4.0,"Great product, nice thin light weight coustum. Not something I would wear during cold weather."
4.0,Hat was exactly as described!!!
4.0,The size is a little small than I expected
4.0,Georgeous dress. I was hoping that it would fit. It fit in the waste/rib cage but the top and shoulders were to big. If I had gotten a smaller size it would have been to tight in the rib cage. Also runs a little long. I’m 5’4’ and 122 lb. I bought a medium.
4.0,The skirt is nice it shows off my curves the skirt is slightly see through but other than that it’s perfect.
4.0,"This is a nice, soft shirt. Since it's unisex, it seems to run a bit large for women."
4.0,"I like this. I get compliments on it, but it's fairly large for my head."
4.0,Great insert but metatarsal support is less than shoes. May need additional insert to put on support.  I am adding a metatarsal pad.
4.0,I followed the instructions for sizing and got a XXL but it was WAY too big! Size down! The material is thick and it can get warm quick. I would not recommend on hot day. But overall its nice
4.0,"This beanie is very warm, and it's great for listening to music. The mic is not so great. If you're like me and have a big head, this will fit easily."
4.0,"Beautiful, but I don't like how the arms are so close-fitting. They stretch yes, but plus-sized upper arms look better with a looser fit."
4.0,"Crystal is nice just don't count on using with the included chain. Broke immediately, very flimsy. Would be better off selling without it to keep reviews up."
4.0,"Easy to wear, magnet comes unclipped easy at times"
4.0,"The necklace was a little thinner than appears, overall a nice necklace, just smaller than appears."
4.0,"These are really thick and nice winter gloves. They do run large and are a little bulky for my small female hands. They fit my husbands hands nicely. They seem and feel heavy duty and good quality. The gloves have a little battery section inside that allow batteries for heated gloves. Even without this function the gloves are nice. They don’t get super hot, but do give off a little warmth. Keeps the chill out of your bones. It’s a nice little addition."
4.0,"Been wearing these several times a day for over a month. No chips, nicks, or scratches.<br /><br />They do an okay job with the sun, but I'm not sure they're really polarized. My other polarized glasses make certain colors look different when I wear them, and these don't.<br /><br />Still, decent for the money."
4.0,"Love the product, but not the delivery time?"
4.0,"Love this for my little prince. Fit is a little smaller, but they state that in the description"
4.0,It came and was just a tad smaller than I expected but still fit (it's very stretchy). I ordered a med and have a B cup and am a size 7. I love that it was so convenient for nursing. And your stomach was completely covered which is nice right after having a baby. Good quality. Have had mine for 7 months and wear it frequently. It even stretched over my bump while i was still pregnant!
4.0,"it stamps real light, not dark enough"
4.0,"I love the product, but it was too small for me.  Fit my sister, however, and she got compliments on it when she wore it to the pool."
4.0,I liked the ring in a box. However the setting is a bit too wide for the ring finger
4.0,Food product for price fits as expected
4.0,These leggings are super soft inside! They are so comfortable which makes me want to never take them off.  They are a bit big on me and they tend to sag in the crotch area because of that but folding over the waistband helps a bit. As much as I love the fleece I really really do not like the outside of the leggings! I expected the outside to be like regular leggings and yoga pants but it is a completely different material. Everything gets caught on them and after only a few wears they look really bad. My fingernails get snagged creating pulls and fraying and every hair and fuzz gets trapped in the fibers. The hair is nearly impossible to get out! If you have pets keep them far away from these leggings. My kittens have managed to snag the leggings really bad and my dogs probably would too if given the chance to get near them. I love the comfort of them I just wish I was able to wear them in public without spending an hour getting hair out and trying to make them look nice.
4.0,"Was way shorter than I imagined, but I got a lot of compliments!"
4.0,"Good slippers, a little more cushion would be nice."
4.0,This shirt fits well. The material is thicker than it appears in the photo.
4.0,A bit snug but they are nicely made
4.0,"They're fine and as desribed, except for the brand name doesnt match. Still a good deal for 2 pairs at this price. But Amazon really needs to reduce their packaging. The socks were in their original chinese plastic packaging, then in a white shipping envelope, then in the Amazon shipping envelope."
4.0,"Cute but thin,  see every line"
4.0,I really love them . I didn't imagine how they will look .
4.0,"The material of this dress is perfect for Florida summers. It’s lightweight cotton material and hits my legs above the ankle (I’m 5’7). I wanted to love this dress but the medium, which is my normal size was huge! There was not one place where this dress would fit and if I went with the small, the dress would be at an awkward length for a maxi so I had to skip out.<br /><br />Definitely size down and if you’re over 5’5 be aware of the length."
4.0,"I like how the shoes fit the were true to size. I bought the shoes to use for west coast swing. I loved how the arriving time said it was to come march 5th but they have arrived a week early. Hope this shoe last me a while, we just have to wait and see."
4.0,I really liked the leggings it fit a bit snug but great material and stretch.
4.0,"Antlers don't stick up as hoped, but very comfortable and great price!"
4.0,"SO FAR, so good. I've only tried on him the football ones, but they were great! Great look, great fit, hopefully long lasting because I think he can wear them for years to come:)"
4.0,"I love this.  For the price, it is very nice 👌"
4.0,"Fit as expected, got an xl for my husband. Hes 6'2, 230. Was thinner than I had hoped, but y hubs likes it because it's breathable."
4.0,"A great deal for a good product. However, the bamboo blend ones are so much better, it's worth it to pay a bit more for those. These do not wash up as well, they get stiff and rough after the first few washes."
4.0,"Beautiful bag with plenty of room. The only thing I don't particularly care for with this type of bag is the flimsy inner pocket that divides the inside of the bag into two sections. I wish this pocket had more stability so it didn't fall over. I am enjoying the bag and it is well made. The color is rich and I'm considering getting the one that looks dark pink for spring. The one I purchased is wine red and the pink looking one, the color is called red. Thank you I'm really enjoying this bag."
4.0,"These socks are very cute and I've received lots of complements on them. The only thing I don't like is the top band isn't very comfortable and leaves deep indents and sock patterns in my skin, where my Jobst compression socks do not. These are just not quite as comfortable."
4.0,"They were larger than I expected. I bought as party favors for 90s party, have gotten compliments since! Very lightweight. The backs are little plastic pieces. Not high quality, but very worth the price."
4.0,Nice product at a reasonable price.
4.0,"They did the trick for me, both a 5 hour and 7 hour flights.  I would recommend them.<br />They do shrink quite a bit after the first wash, but with a little hand stretching they will fit.<br />The socks are comfortably warm,  I would suggest a light weight version for travel to warmer climates."
4.0,The cups inside top are great and the bottoms are comfortable
4.0,These pants are very cute and can easily be dressed up or down.  The fabric is flowy and can work as dressy pants with a cute top and flats And  are flattering and have enough stretch to make them comfortable.
4.0,Only thing I didn't like is how they rolled up.
4.0,Other than the size i think the item is great
4.0,Really like the compact size.
4.0,Very cute dress! Great for summer time!
4.0,"I love the colors, the style, and the fit. Thought it would be a bit longer though. That's ok I'm still keeping this beautiful sweater. It runs big,therefore I order the xl. I'm 5'7 200lbs if that will help anyone out. Btw, shake your sweater out or use link roller before wearing because the strings from garment will get on your clothes that your'e wearing."
4.0,I love this dress.. The only thing I am in trouble is that it opens in the front.. Perhaps it doesnt happen if there were more buttons.. I also would add something to stand the belt in its place.. The material looks great and with a good quality. And it streches!
4.0,Exactly what I expected. Very pleased!
4.0,"This is really cute, and fits my toddler well, however I'm working on convincing her it's a good idea to wear it."
4.0,It's adorable!  Looks so cute on my  miniature schnauzer! The velcro keeps it from sliding around on her collar. Very well made.
4.0,They are a soft piece of leather. They work for kids if they leave them on...
4.0,Had to return because it was too big for my son who is 10.  I'm sure it would be great for an adult.
4.0,Just wished it was a twist lock. Other than  that I loved them.
4.0,I really like these a lot- because I wear them under V necks & open shirts a lot. I only wish they had a lace border.<br />I would order again! Thanks
4.0,These fit perfectly for little girls or extra piercings like second and thirds
4.0,This bracelet was for a Girlfriend I’ve known for 40 years! She’s wonderful & I wanted to send it to her to know how much I appreciate her friendship thru the years. It looks great and she really loved it!
4.0,I didn't realize they had a rubber bottom.  My grandson is having a hard time getting used to them.
4.0,Too big and too short
4.0,"Adorable little outfit!! Fit my 2 year old daughter perfectly. However, the Rudolph nose fell off after 3 hours of her wearing the outfit and had to be sewn back on."
4.0,Pockets were a bit too small and people kept calling this a pikachu but looked great otherwise.
4.0,I got more compliments wearing this than ever before. 5'9 200 but smaller in the belly/chest area. I wear a xl or L normally but ordered a 3xl. Should have ordered a 2x. Size runs about 2 sizes smaller than US sizes.
4.0,Minor stitching issue in the crown but otherwise the Husband loves it.
4.0,Quite pretty. A bit more sheer than I like. I am 5'4 -130 lb. Was going to order large because I don't like clingy shirts but other reviewers wrote that it was billowy so ordered medium and it fits fine.
4.0,Good dress overall. I’m short 4’ 11-1/2” and the straps aren’t as sturdy or adjustable as much as I’d like them to be but I managed to still make it work.
4.0,This piece is very good for a man. It shows the Armor of God in detail and is a noticeable Tie clip or Lapel Pin.
4.0,"It's ok, not great,but it passes"
4.0,"The necklace is pretty, but doesn't hang well. The tree charm is too close to the moon and it doesn't hang inside the crescent like it should (the cresent lays partially on top of the tree charm). Since I have jewelry-making tools, I may try to fix it. Still, for the price, it's cute."
4.0,"I would have given these 5 stars if some of the crystals weren't out of alignment on one of the straps. These are sturdy for my 36DD, while being glamorous. I have clear plastic straps on my Victoria Secret bra, these give me another option."
4.0,"Had to order twice! Don’t necessarily go off the amazon sizing reccomendation. The medium would have fit if the bust size was bigger. I’m a 38C. So i ordered the Large for a nicer, looser, flowy fit"
4.0,"Really like this dress. It was kind of a heavy material, but it fit really well. Had to use some double stick tape for the bust (size 16, bust DD) because it was a bit too small. Collar comes up a bit high, but very cute dress."
4.0,"It came in a week early, granted it was a month wait in total but atleast they tell you upfront. It's really stretchy so it fits very nicely. Mine was an XL. The fabric is comfortable. The design looks how it did in the picture. The only thing I'm not crazy about is how the little edge of the white fabric in the front keeps lifting up. Other than that I am very happy with my purchase and am excited to wear it to interviews and professional settings."
4.0,I followed the reviews and ordered a size larger than usual and the fit is perfect.  Great value for boxers with a button fly.
4.0,Loved the color and pattern but it was kinda small but I wear it anyway....Love it...
4.0,"Good quality product. However, I have not found it true that it won't get your stuff wet when you get in the car when it is raing."
4.0,gift...……..cant say how it is really liked.
4.0,"Fit well, super soft. Not sure how long they will hold up but will see and the price was right!"
4.0,"These arrived today, two days before expected. They're simple and adorable and I would give them 5 stars except they are a little awkward to wear. They keep getting caught in my long hair and slip out of position, making them look a little funny. I took them out and tried to bend them to be closer to my ear, that's helped. I have another pair in my wishlist and will order them if I get used to these. I would definitely recommend them, but know they're not like wearing regular earrings."
4.0,So far happy with the leggings. The material is better then I expected after reading some reviews. The waist band is super thick and at least 3 inches long. Bonus: they match my pink seamless bra that I have on in the photo. I tried to squat in them & they appear to be squat proof so far. I plan to wear them on a hike in the near future and will update my review with how they hold up. Overall I would recommend buying these & go for your true size. I’m 5”5 and 148 and I ordered a medium. I have a smaller waist and a bigger but and hips. I hope this review helps! 😊❤️‍🔥
4.0,well made- was small so buy a bigger size.  It seems like Asian sizing
4.0,"A little thinner that I was expecting, but I ended up loving them! My daughter is almost in a 3t so I went one size up and they fit perfect!"
4.0,"I am between a M/L and unfortunately the XL was just a little too small for me. Quality was not bad for the price. It is a cute blouse, very much like the photos."
4.0,Good product. 4 stars because it didn't clean my white sneakers flawlessly in one go.
4.0,"Great pattern, wish fabric was waterproof so when wet it didn't leak to the other side and stain clothing. I bought this for my kid for arts and crafts and science projects and did leak into her clothes and get her clothes wet and stained.  But for just cooking with flour and chocolates not so bad."
4.0,Not as soft as my one other pair. I don’t know why since it’s the same material.
4.0,"The elastic on the waste line is a little higher than expected, so it looks a little awkward. Otherwise, fit was great!"
4.0,"It looks great. The problem I have with it is that the back extension part of the chain is so short that it's hard to clasp it. It's tight around the neck. I'm 5'4 140 and it's a bit hard for me to clasp it around my neck. If you are a bit on the larger size, don't bother. Will not fit you at all."
4.0,"Loved the brown color which is more like camel color. Perfect size for everyday work and commute. It easily fit my 13&#34; and 15&#34; laptop with few extra stuff I carry everyday. Inside pockets are perfect for organizing cosmetics, phone, some money, etc.<br /><br />Nicely made, does not look cheap. Inner lining is good material as well. Don't have anything negative to say about this bag. For this price, I found this just perfect."
4.0,It's nice but you need to go 2 sizes up for sure.
4.0,"Comfortable fit, very soft and reasonable price."
4.0,"This is a nice, stylish hoodie. I love how they advised me BEFORE the purchase that this size runs small for the U.S. market.  It is form-fitting and flattering. The only drawback is that the material is thinner than I expected. Not something you would wear in colder weather, otherwise, this is a nice &#34;muscle&#34; hoodie."
4.0,"These are cute little Star of David earrings.  I hate that I live in a world where I am hesitant to wear them whenever I want, but I am likely to sport them during holidays, when I am out and about, etc.  Just maybe not to work, unfortunately.  :(<br />First, they came beautifully packaged in a nice black, velvet box, making it a lovely gift to give someone.  They also came with a second set of backs, so you have two different backings to choose from, or, if you're like me and you tend to lose a back every now and then, it's a spare.<br />The earrings themselves are about 1/2 an inch from point to opposite point - or 9/16 and inch if you want to be more precise.  For me, it basically covers my earlobe.  They appear to be well made, and sparkle the way you would expect cubic zirconias to sparkle.<br />I am not sure they are worth $20, but I guess that depends on where you live and how easy it is to find Judaica jewelry.  It's also on Prime, so it saves you a trip to the store!  Maybe that justifies the price.  Overall, they're a nice pair of earrings.<br />Disclosure: I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  I know people are skeptical of these types of reviews, but I keep my review as honest as possible and judge the product not on the price I paid but instead the current price listed on Amazon.  I rarely give 5 stars as I reserve that for products that I absolutely LOVE – things that are life changing.  4 stars indications that I like the product and would consider buying again at a regular price.  It’s something that is useful in my everyday life, even if I don’t love it.  Three stars indicates it’s ok, but I might not purchase it again.  It’s nothing special.  One or two stars indicates that the product stinks, even at a discounted price.<br />Good luck shopping!"
4.0,Quality earrings
4.0,I thought it was going to be bigger.
4.0,Very nice fits material is kind of thinner other wise good shirt
4.0,These leggings are really nice and warm.  Good for winters and have very squishy internal fleece lining.  I bought 4/5 size or for my 41/2yr old and these fit perfectly
4.0,Bought this product to use as face masks. Works out well. Can breathe through them. Can get a little warm but I imagine all face masks do.
4.0,Cute but one of the strand broke when worn fir the first time.
4.0,"These shorts are more ""stay at home shorts"" in my opinion.  They are made from a thin material which is soft and very attractive looking. They come to just above my knees (I'm 5'9"") It has 2 front pockets, NO back pockets.  The pockets are big enough to hold my 5.5"" phone, or my ""George Kastanza"" bi-fold wallet, but the design of the pants doesn't allow for much support of the weight of either one of those items, hence one of the reasons why I said these are ""stay at home"" shorts.  The care instructions say machine wash cold, do not bleach, tumble dry low, do not iron.<br />These shorts are made in communist China.<br />I would recommend these, but only for wearing around the house, or a quick trip to a convenience store."
4.0,Beautiful dress!!! Fit to size. My only complaint is the underskirt/slip part is not as long as the dress. It only comes to your knees. Would be much better if it were to actual hemline of outer skirt.
4.0,"Its a nifty idea, and keeps the lid with the bottom.  Also seems to be water tight so you could probably store liquid but I haven't tested this as a travel container with liquid.  Downside is it's bulky and doesn't store well.  Also it can be difficult to make that last twist to lock it closed tight.  Lastly I have some concerns about how well the sleeve comes clean in the dishwasher, though you can wash it by hand."
4.0,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas.She said they are comfortable but just a tiny bit too small. She normally wears a 9 1/2 so I ordered a 10 after reading other reviews.
4.0,It's not as nice as my expensive GoRuk but also not anywhere near as costly. The bag has plenty of space and pockets to stash gear. It has a laptop pocked but that's not padded so a sleeve would be recommended if you're doing more than just go to and from work in car or train. I like the cinch straps too. I don't fill it all the way up so it is nice to make it more compact.
4.0,"Good quality, my my issue is its a tad big around my neck and its supposed to fit comfortably on the neck"
4.0,Love this dresse
4.0,"OK, I LOVE this nose ring. I like nose rings that draw attention, and this is super pretty and a nice size. BUT -- does anyone know the best way to put it on? The only way I have figured out is to &#34;open&#34; the ring so it fits over your nose, and then &#34;close&#34; it back up once inserted and flower in the right place. However, I worry about breaking the metal! After repeated opening and closing, I would imagine that could crack the metal at it's weakest point. Any suggestions / advise?"
4.0,Beautiful sunglasses. A little big if you are looking for something classic.
4.0,The tee shift is very well made Just do not put it in the dryer lay it down flat it washes well my grandson loves this tee shirt.
4.0,"Shipping was very quick. I like the knitted designs and the warm, fuzziness of the inner layer. Overall, very good quality. But I only give this 4 stars, because like other reviewers said, the inner & outer layers are not sewn together at the fingertips, so the fuzzy layer will detach itself after several use or even just after a wash. I ended up having to sew every single fingertip before using to save myself some future hassles."
4.0,"I replaced the band one year ago and needed a new band again this year.  The 2 layers of the band separated.  I tried to glue it together and it stayed together for a month, then came apart again so I bought a new band, otherwise, it fits the watch fine, the black leather looks fine.  The screws are extremely tiny so have a magnifier ready.  It is about 3/4 inch longer than my old band.  I have small wrists so the end of the strap is visible from the top view of the watch and I may need to add a hole.  The second loop keeps the excess strap from sticking out so it’s ok - the end is neatly tucked away.  I did not try the new screws, just used the old ones, and the included screw driver worked fine.  The box has S/M and M/L printed on it, but a size was not marked - would have been nice to have a smaller size.  Hopefully this one will last longer than one year."
4.0,"Fits in the the body well, the breast/bra area was too tight, had to go up a size."
4.0,"Cute dress, a bit long. Easy to alter though."
4.0,"I really like this.  It's not too bulky, covers well.  Nice cut."
4.0,"The lettering on this is tiny, so it's a bit hard to read. Otherwise, it's interesting."
4.0,"I purchased this t-shirt for my mom as a gift because she loves her dog so much. It shipped quickly and was packaged just fine. The material is very soft and comfortable (it actually has the Hanes logo on it). I ordered an XL but it seems more like an XXL, it’s pretty big. My mom usually wears a Large – XL and this MIGHT fit her if it shrinks a bit. If I was to repurchase, I would order a size smaller. I’m not sure if Hanes shirts usually run a bit big but it’s very possible.<br />The printing on the shirt is perfect and looks great. Besides the sizing issue, which could very well be normal, I love the shirt! It’s comfortable and cute, so I definitely would recommend it. I did purchase this shirt at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review and would never recommend a product that I wouldn’t use myself."
4.0,So glad I ordered a size up. Like my coats bigger so I can wear a sweater underneath. I ordered up a size. It was still almost too tight to wear with multiple garments like a tshirt and sweater underneath. If I would have tried it on in the store I probably would've gone up another size. Still a warm comfy coat and I'm happy with the purchase!
4.0,I ordered xl it fit perfectly! Super soft and comfortable to wear. I definitely recommend this if u are looking for a sweater. U won't be disappointed
4.0,"These shoes look just fantastic. I absolutely love Shellys London shoes and have never been disappointed with them. However, these shoes are constructed a little bit weird and because of that, they aren't as comfortable as my other Shellys London shoes. The second strap hits too high on my foot and makes them stiff to walk in and a bit clunky. It's like they don't bend and move with my foot, but move against it, if that makes sense. I have several pairs of shoes in this style and I don't have a problem with any of the others, which is why I believe the second strap is just placed too high. I also got a blister on the top of my right foot, on the side where that second strap hits my foot, most likely because the strap is too high and they don't move so they rubbed against my foot. The other shoes was fine however, and I didn't get any blister on my left foot. I wore them to work and was at my desk most of the day, so did not really walk around in them a lot. I don't want to give them up because they are so cool looking, so I think I will wear them again once the blister heals and see how they break in."
4.0,"I like it.. However, since I'm like 5'6.5 the torso part looks too short which kinda makes me look funny.. (long legs-short body) so I had to use a black mid-body belt to extend the black part to the skirt so it doesn't look uneven.. (I hope my explanation makes some type of sense) I LIKE it a LOT though!"
4.0,The shirt was a little small. Pants fix just right.
4.0,Wish it was a bit longer.
4.0,Good inexpensive eye glasses. I use them for cycling. The cushions block out debris. Large size actually fits my big head...
4.0,"Nice thick material, not see through."
4.0,It's a key chain.
4.0,A dress with pockets! Love it! Very pretty and flattering. Zipper could be higher quality though.
4.0,The color was not the same as pictured. The color is more of a tan/light brown. It's still cute just not what I expected.
4.0,Got XL. Need to be sure and get what you wear in size or step up a size. Thin material.
4.0,"PRO: Warm, comfy, like the head/wrist closures.<br /><br />Less than perfect:  The zipper is on the wrong side.As a guy I'm used to pulling the zipper up on the opposite side.  I had another swim parka from another manufacturer that I returned due to poor fit and it was on the same side as this one. Are they all like that?<br />Otherwise it is perfect."
4.0,super cute dress
4.0,They're all real stone everything is exact except the the sizing is off mine were a  little bit too small
4.0,"Nice, but it’s orange not red as it appears"
4.0,Quick Service......lovely
4.0,"The one thing I liked about these glasses is the wooden legs, they look outstanding, the material and carrying case are great also. The reason I’m not giving a 5 star is because I haven’t been able to notice a big difference while using them at night. During the day they work great, every thing looks clear, but when I used them at night, the difference is minimum. They look great and great for during day use. Nice style and good packaging."
4.0,"Love these!  The XL was huge, what I’d usually order, but a large was ok.<br />Top is stretchy material but bottoms have NO stretch, which is weird. But I still love them."
4.0,"Very stylish and luxurious feeling shades. Construction looks sturdy, I bought the Gold/Pink frames. I'm satisfied, but just wish the arms were matte black instead of woodgrain. Just personal choice."
4.0,Would be a cute fit except for the top which is very billowy and a little big. Nice material.
4.0,"This bikini is ok.. the top is awkward in the front, it is too bad it doesn't come in an XS because the top could be tighter. Bottoms fit fine. Not my favorite suit, but it will do. I am 5'4&#34;, 115lbs, 34B and bought the smallest size. I believe S size 2"
4.0,my husband loves this<br />uses it everyday<br />the only minor thing is the ring that hold the chain to the wallet came loose already he had to pinch it back together but like i said thats minor
4.0,"I really like how unique this bathing suit is. The fabric for the bottoms is nice and soft and is very form fitting. However, the top does run a bit small. I ordered a size small, and I usually wear a 34 C in bras. I definitely feel like my boobs are spilling out  if I don't situate it correctly. I would love if you could buy the bottoms and top separate so I could try a medium top (buying a medium for the bottoms would be a bit too loose)"
4.0,"nice fit, feels good"
4.0,I am a nut on sewing and love this shirt
4.0,"The design is cute, the only reason I give it a four star because the material is very thin. But the colors are very nice on the white dress."
4.0,The frame is a bit on the cheap side but lenses are very clear. if the frame was more sturdy this wold be a 5 star.
4.0,"I'm 5'4"", 150lbs and order a medium (in navy). Fits how I wanted it too, loose and flowy.<br /><br />The materials is quite thin and gets thinner after the first wash. While a slip is not needed, just be aware of standing in direct sun light and the color of your undergarments.<br /><br />It a great dress to have for a variety of occasions. I would purchase again."
4.0,"I have two of these dresses. The colors are beautiful.  They are flattering and comfortable right out of the bag. However, do not dry them in the dryer and do not hang them to dry. Dry flat. The fabric is heavy when wet. They will shrink a bit if dried in the dryer and maybe not fit as loosely (if that was what you wanted); and if you hang them to dry on a hanger they will stretch lengthwise and be too long. My teal one now drags on the floor and is not as loose as I need it to be around the middle. Sad! I am going to try to stretch them when wet to see if I can reclaim some of the original fit. If not, they will have to go. :("
4.0,"Awesome watch! Sleek design and reasonably priced, doesn't feel like a weight on your wrist. Only problem with the paisley color os the watch face is unreadable when dark and there os no light function. Also, I can attest to the water resistance as I have dropped it in a puddle while adjusting it once and wore it in the rain and snow on many occasions."
4.0,Good -
4.0,"It’s fine, nothing special"
4.0,"So I was a little bummed that the bow featured with the outfit just came as a piece of fabric. There is no way I can get the bow to look like the picture. Wish it was seen to look as cute at the pic. Also, the fabric is not the best and didn’t hold up great after multiple washes on a regulars cycle in the machine. It is a cute outfit though for a good price."
4.0,"I always wear M, but for this to fit snug I'm exchanging for a S.<br />The black vest in the pic is a matte finish, however the product delivered is shiny."
4.0,"Too large,butpretty colors"
4.0,works well as a dice bag for RPGers - gave out as party gifts at my RPG
4.0,This was a great necklace however having a choice in the chain would have been a better option. My wife was not too fond of the necklace that it came with the pendant and the stone are absolutely beautiful and I would recommend this to anyone
4.0,Fit like they should I have a 13&#34; AA foot and they fit just like they should.  Pricy for socks but now that I am getting a but older in life and have a bit more money it's nice to be able to buy products that are quality.  Would have done 5 stars but the price hold them back.
4.0,Comfortable and love the heel height
4.0,Light weight and comfortable. Photos on site don’t do it justice. Can’t wait to wear it
4.0,"I really like then, but I feel like they will tear is your not careful"
4.0,I think i expected too much about the quality but overall im satisfied.
4.0,"I bought this for my Samsung Gear 2 Neo. It has a very clean look to it. The band is not too heavy. The box ships with a tool to install the band. As for removing the links, I used a &#34;push-pin&#34; like you use on cork boards to remove the links. There are no instructions included in the box on how to remove them, but it is not hard. The pin that holds the link in place is flared on one end which holds it in place. Just use the push-pin to drive the pin out from the opposite side. As for the clasp, other reviews state that it does not hold. It will hold fine but you have to pinch it together with your fingers instead of flipping it closed on nicer watches. It is a good band for the price. The OEM band was horrible."
4.0,Size up! Other than that love it. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,"I thought it would be more like a sweatshirt material but it's a thin long sleeve t-shirt. Good for spring, summer, or early fall but not the warm shirt I wanted when we ordered it. It is super cute though."
4.0,Love that Nike took over as the official sponsor for jerseys in the NBA. But Nike pricing is steep. Would give 5 stars but not quite worth the price.
4.0,good value but sooo big and too long did not shrink as I hoped
4.0,"Everything fits perfectly except for the skirt, its too small, at least those are cheep and easy to get so no biggie."
4.0,Purchased for a 50th Birthday celebration. I purchased the Lg if you want more room do a size up . If you want that 50’s look purchase a petticoat. I received so many compliments on my look .
4.0,Fits my daughter well and she often wears this on the weekends rather than getting dressed
4.0,Gave as a gift to a huge Dr. Who fan and it was a big hit. She loved it!
4.0,"The cross is solid and rather attractive.  When ordering, plan on getting a new chain with it.  Good buy for the price though."
4.0,"Nice and Light., easy to use. No outside pocket for a cell phone, or keys."
4.0,Nice dress code material
4.0,"at first i absolutely loved this necklace, and i still do love it, but i am a little less now because the metal does seem to want to tarnish a bit.  i am going to clean and store it in a jewelry box that insists it helps stall the tarnish process, i can only hope.<br /><br />it is a lovely slightly unique piece - the jewel is pretty tiny but the star around it does help to make it stand out.  the chain is a single fixed length - if you need more you will need to add your own extender.<br /><br />i think the necklace is very pretty - it's subtle and small and yet still makes a statement, which is basically my style.  something to capture attention but not take away from anything else you are wearing."
4.0,Pants were perfect my butt looked a little flat but I will adjust the look.
4.0,"This dress was picked for me so it normally would not have been my first choice. However, it was incredibly flattering and worked out very well! It was pretty short on me though (5’10”), especially in the back so I had to watch what I was doing."
4.0,Very pretty but they don't stay up on your ear like they are meant to.  They look okay hanging down too though.
4.0,"Product fits perfect ! I really needed this being in the medical field and working with covid-19 patients , the hospital does not provide proper ppd for everyone and are very cheap with providing scrub caps ! I appreciate everyone making these !"
4.0,"Comfortable, flattering.  I like it. Thin ribbed knit. Hangs well stretches well molds to body. Like the length and off center points."
4.0,"This is a very fine mesh, so it's only good for a nightgown or swimsuit coverup or over other clothes. But it's pretty and fits as expected."
4.0,These are well made and provide great support but didn’t fit in my daughter’s shoes.
4.0,Warm and comfortable but needs stronger straps to help hold them up
4.0,"Soft, comfortable. Size large, I am usually 10 or 12 , made it not clingy, as the knit material is a little thin."
4.0,a little stiff but good for the price
4.0,"These are cute and comfortable shorts.  They fit me perfectly but they are shorter than I'd hoped.  The inseam is not stated on Amazon and I posed the question but never got an answer.  The inseam for the small size is only about 3 inches.<br /><br />The fabric is nice and should be comfortable for summer.  As other reviewers mentioned, the draw string is not needed to I removed it."
4.0,Very pretty. Nice fit.
4.0,These are nice glasses for the price. And a good warranty.
4.0,Beautiful..  meant alot to my daughter!
4.0,"Fit great, no sun exposure rashes since wearing them, gripper dots work well. Only wish I could find ladies sized gloves that aren't so &#34;frilly.&#34;"
4.0,"I purchased the double-pack for $16.  That’s a great price for these sunglasses.  The fit my face very well and appear to have a good construction considering the price.<br /><br />I needed these specifically to wear during outdoor exercise where I didn’t want the sunglasses to fog.  I thought the vents at the top would help elevate that problem and it does, to an extent.  The glasses still fog but not as much as non-vented types.<br /><br />The ear stems are not as long as the competitors in this area.  I like that and it fits my head better without the stems sticking out past my head."
4.0,This wallet was a great purchase and i am happy i made it. The wallet is soft to the touch but seems strong. I love the red color o the inside.
4.0,"This Lovezesent dressy t-shirt, blouse is okay.  It is a stretchy nylon type material.  I purchased the Orange color and it is like a pumpkin color.  The shirt has short sleeves that are a good length.  The shirt is not quite as long as what I expected from the way it looks in the picture.  It definitely seems shorter than what I was expecting.  The neck line is a scoop neck in the front and back and there is a strap sown across the back to help keep the shirt up on your shoulders.  This fits more tightly than I expected.  Overall I will get some wear out of this shirt but it is not going to be a favorite.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review."
4.0,The price is right for these good looking gloves. My husband says they are OK in terms of warmth. I will judge them later to see if in indeed it is a good value. They are soft and comfortable.
4.0,"good frames, I could probably drop them a few times before they break, I'm happy with the purchase :) :)"
4.0,Was not the color I ordered but I was still cute
4.0,"Smaller than expected, doesn't fall as low as the picture, but nice none the less"
4.0,Beautiful earrings I had them in silver but wanted a gold pair as well very nice earrings live the design not disappointed in any way
4.0,"Nice tunic top. Runs a little small.  It's great for sitting at a desk all day.  Not so great for any type of activity.  I ordered the largest size they have, so can't swap out. Nice color, just like photo."
4.0,"I really like the fabric of this dress. It's very soft to the touch and stretchy. Not see through at all and seems light enough for summer. I feel like it runs a little big though, even after washing. Should be very easy to breastfeed, which why I purchased the dress."
4.0,It was smaller than expected and the writing on the inside wasn't an engraving like in the anime. I gave four stars because even though it isn't 100% accurate it's still nice and works properly.
4.0,Nice shorts. Right size. Light. The material is like a windbreaker/swim trunks
4.0,My son loved the ear rings
4.0,El kimono llegó incompleto. Faltó el llavero. Por lo demás queda bien
4.0,"The material is WONDERFUL and so soft!  The draw strings are a tad long, I might cut them back.  I LOVE THE POCKETS!!!"
4.0,"Great quality and fast shipping, but I got then to replace mine that was lost and the black beads are a glossy finish, not flat / matte like in the picture. But still a great quality piece"
4.0,"These minimalist sock liners stretch to fully enclose the lowest parts of the foot from toes to heel. I wear a shoe size 7 and these feel okay, with good length overall and room in the heel, but maybe slightly small in the toe, like my toes are being pushed together. The fabric is a bit stiffer and thicker (and more absorbent) than similar socks I have. A gel strip at the upper inside-back keeps them on my heels all day with zero slippage. I machine-washed and air-dried them and they came through nicely. They’re a good liner to pair with my Skechers Harmonious shoes."
4.0,Fit nicely. Im a 36c.
4.0,"Not as flowy as I expected, the shirt is shaped differently than whats posted, still cute and comfy!"
4.0,I love the hat and wear it everyday. It is a little thicker material but very nice quality.
4.0,"They are really cute but a bit too small. I got a M, but I think a L would be closer to my size. I say just size up."
4.0,"Like other reviewers, I found that these shoes run narrow and also somewhat short (see pic for measurements). I usually wear a 9N in Naturalizer and Clarks, and a 9 1/2 N or AA in nearly every other brand (except: some brands like Bella Vita and easy street are way too wide even in narrow width). I’ve never seen a size 10 sandal fit me, but this one fits, with only about 1/16” to spare. So they seem to be 1/2 to 1 size small in length. The strap across the forefoot is just a little loose for me, but I will be able to wear it. So If you have a medium foot, it will be too narrow. They don’t look like they are poorly made, however I will try to update the review if they turn out to be. I really like the style and the way they look on my feet. They feel more padded than many shoes (like, 2-3 times as comfortable as a Vanelli footbed), which I like a lot. I also love the chunky heel because of the greater stability it provides (not a fan of heels, but I wear them for my BF). The metal piece that the end of the strap goes into on the buckle is attached by a an elastic loop instead of sewn onto the ankle strap (see pic), & it’s a little difficult to maneuver, plus I’m not sure how well that will wear. Also, I have moderately high arches and these feel like they have no arch support at all, so I will need to add an arch pad.  Because of those 2 things, I gave then 4 stars instead of 5. Maybe that’s too generous, since they also don’t run true to size… But I’m actually thrilled with them. I hope they wear well!"
4.0,Just what you see in the photo. Very nice.
4.0,"I wear a 16w and this was a little loose, but im small chested so it might fit perfectly on a busty gal. Very nice cool material However i still loved it and perhaps I'll size down to a 1x."
4.0,Bueno y sencillo
4.0,"Overall, nice. The material was good, I should have ordered a smaller size, but got lots of complements"
4.0,They run about a half to a whole size larger than all of my daughter's other size 13 shoes and sandals. But they are totally adorable and seem well made hopefully she will grow into them soon.
4.0,Not the most comfortable wig ever but it’s really good for the price! Perfect wig for my Samara costume!
4.0,The strap is kinda thin compared to the dial but looks really nice
4.0,Runs very very small.  Worn a total of 7 times and the edges and seams are already starting to fray and look worn.
4.0,Perfect for my mother who needs assistance in getting dressed.
4.0,Can't say the fit was somewhat small as the top was perfect-- but frankly the bottom simply does not provide enough coverage..My teen jumped for joy before she even got the pkg open. She adores it.
4.0,"3 stars for marketing. Pictures show a seam in the masks, mine have no seam. 4 stars is for the actual masks. Seem well made and fit decent. I'm a bigger guy and they cover my nose and go under my chin and didn't stretch my ears."
4.0,"These are very cute, sparkly, jellyfish.  However, the closure is unusual, and the dangles are not fixed.  I lost one dangle immediately (found it later) from not closing the hoop correctly.  On the plus side, this means you can wear the hoop part separately.  Recommended, as long as you're careful to click the hoop shut."
4.0,"Ordered this as a gift and almost kept it! I really like the layout, ideal for men and women. The side pockets have elastic holders for brushes/razors etc and the main part has ample space for pared down toiletries for travel or to keep in a gym bag etc. Quality wasn't bad and think it'll do the job that's needed. The big thing for me was that it isn't a big bag that you rummage through nor the usual hanging bag that has tiny compartments."
4.0,I love the support
4.0,"Not sure about the longer tunic length - a change in my style.  Works great with stretchy pants or even leotards with the longer length. The fabric is light enough for the summer but will work great for the winter with a jacket or sweater.  I am 5'10 and wear a size 12 or 14, depending on the brand.  Got a large in this one which works fine.  The material is somewhat stretchy, so it should retain its shape pretty well."
4.0,Fine quality!
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE this purse! I bought it for a vacation and it holds everything I need. Unfortunately, the strap broke after a year. I sewed it back on but don’t think it’s going to hold very long."
4.0,"It's such a cute shirt! I'm really bummed it didn't fit me (I usually wear a large but it was too tight).. also not as red as it appears in pictures, more of a wine red. Still beautiful though!"
4.0,It’s got lots of pretty colors
4.0,"This shirt fit very well on the first wear, but after washing it, it lost some size and became a little tighter--not a full size smaller, but noticeable.  If you are on a boundary, order the larger size.<br /><br />Other than that, it is comfortable and looks good while you are wearing it.<br /><br />It wrinkles a *lot* in the washer/dryer.  If you are not the sort that wants to iron or dry clean your clothes, I would not recommend it to you, but otherwise it is a nice shirt."
4.0,I got this for a trip to Jamaica and it fit great.  I always worry about the bottoms but they covered nicely with no movement.  I actually bought another one in a different color I liked it so well.
4.0,Just what I had wanted in a bralette and with enough support without making you feel like you were wearing armor.
4.0,Its little big but very cute
4.0,"I was hoping for a little less alligatoring of the lether (for lack of a better term) on the leather.  Wanted slick black leather.  This is a fine casual, soft leather belt."
4.0,"Polarized with side flash windows, good price and can be used over or stand alone since not too bulky."
4.0,"its really working and good to buy, but you need to know its not that much warm and its finishing not 100%"
4.0,Fits as expected! I went with a medium just cause I like my T’s to fit a little loose. Super cute and comfy too. I’ve gotten a bunch of compliments on it.
4.0,"I live about 35 minutes away from a supermarket, so I bought these to put my groceries in on the way home to keep them cold. They work great - they're the perfect size: hold a good amount of groceries without being overly heavy when full. The zipper is a little finicky and it might not hold up to the test of time, but for the price the quality is pretty good. I like how they fold flat. One note is that they are not waterproof, so don't think you can fill it with a bag of ice and beer - it will melt and make a big puddle. I would just use ice packs."
4.0,"Another gorgeous Allegra K coat! This is my second Allegra K purchase and just like the other coat, it's adorable! And so so so soft! Very good quality and trendy style. However, this one didn't fit as well. My other Allegra K coat has a very generous cut and I fit a size Medium. Normally I'm a size 12. I got the Large in this because reviews/description said it runs small. Well, it runs VERY small. I could barely snap the buttons on this large. I'm going to try the XL and hope its much larger so I can own this beautiful coat! Find your right size and you wont regret it! This coat is warm and soft and looks like a million bucks! Definitely keeps up with designer brands at a fraction of the price!"
4.0,I’m really short and I order an X-Large to make it comfortable and it came out looking like a medium. Besides that it’s great.
4.0,Great gi. Fits as expected and very comfortable.
4.0,"With my son's birthday coming up, I purchased the Dreamone Men's Zipper Hoodie with him in mind.<br /><br />He is about 5'9&#34; tall, about 190 pounds and wears about a size 44 jacket.  With this in mind and also knowing how he likes his clothes to fit him, I thought the XX-Large was a great choice based on the size chart in the item description.  As items like this come from overseas, they have a different cut and style to the clothing, so the size chart is a must.  A XX-Large there was very close to a normal large he would buy.  Even at XX-large, It fits close to the body.  Once it gets warm, he is a tank top kid and the hoodie fits over that like a light shirt.  Great to have in the car for after the gym too.  Not to heavy to get over heated and it breathes well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just out of the package, the hoodie I received had a decent sized foot print on it and I had to fight through a lot a left-over threading.  It seems a little QC before packaging is in order.  I rated this 4 stars based on this.  I don't mind washing the clothes before wearing them, we usually do anyhow, but it should still be clean inside the packaging.  Once the hanging threads were handled (I cut them with a sharp set of scissors, then a quick blast of heat from a lighter to seal the edge), everything else looked good.  The seams are very solid around sleeves, hood, and zipper.  The zipper has a nice even pull to it and it easily glides from top to bottom without any snags or loose teeth.<br /><br />When he received the present, he was completely thrilled.  I don't normally buy him clothes.  One, he's old enough to do it himself and two, our styles don't always line up.  The Dreamone hoodie with it's classic white and black design was a complete winner.  Please note, I was lucky enough to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,I have loved this perfume for 30 years - originally Anne Klein II.<br />The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the delivery system.<br />If you need 2 pumps - the second one doesn't work well.
4.0,These bracelets are cute... they'll be my go-to bracelets for the summer!
4.0,Liked fabric and how it fit on my body
4.0,"I ordered the red, it's a tomato red/orange, on the bright side, probably a little too bright for me. This is a nice briefcase/satchel/bag, very roomy. I was able to fit my 17 inch laptop and a textbook, as well as my wallet, make-up bag, spiral notebook, and a bottled water. There is an outside pocket for your keys and phone, there are also several inside pockets two with zippers and two open pockets. The inside lining is this cotton but its held up with everything I throw in the bag. I wear it as a crossbody bag and it can be heavy with my school stuff in it.<br /><br />There are side straps that are woven through and snap on the back. In order for me to fit everything, I had to unsnap and pull the strap through (as seen in the photo with my accounting book) however, even snapped, the purse is still pretty roomy. The &#34;pleather&#34; is stiff but not hard so the bag will stand up on its own and not lose its shape. There 's no little feet on the bottom, it would have been a plus but its okay.<br /><br />For the price this bag is really worth it, stick with black tho, unless you're really fashion forward and can pull off a brightly colored bag."
4.0,"What a cute sweater, and the quality is decent. It's too bad the sizes run small. The largest size didn't fit me. I gave it to a much smaller friend, and she loved it!"
4.0,My 5 yo loves it.
4.0,"Nice necklace for over sweaters, etc. good length."
4.0,These are big! Adult size. Fun and good quality.  My kiddo wanted to be like mama.
4.0,"would need to get a size bigger next round, not bad though"
4.0,Sturdy. It is NOT printed on both sides. That would have been nice
4.0,I like the color and feel of the dress.  It was  also easy to clean . I wore it church and to dinner.
4.0,God fit and comfortable!
4.0,"The outfit worked great for our purposes of a smash cake photoshoot. The quality was nice, and definitely added something special to the photoshoot. Based on other reviews I did size up a bit, and it worked out fine! the hat and tie were a bit big, but the bloomers fit great."
4.0,"Needed a last minute dress for a 1 month old girl. The dress was a little big, but not so big she couldn’t wear it. It was adorable, looks pretty well made, and held up well to its first wash before she wore it. (Pink long sleeve with roses)"
4.0,They were delivered while it was raining and left outside by the door. Soaking wet. The socks are well  made but will not last long because they are thin. I bought them for a gift and will not buy again.
4.0,"Beautiful dress but more bodycon than I anticipated (duh). If you want a decent fit for work etc, perhaps go a size up. I love it otherwise."
4.0,"Really cute and comfortable. Only concern is the chest area, I think it’s going to require some tape to avoid a slip!"
4.0,"Earrings are very pretty, just what I was looking for because they are tasteful.  However, they are very heavy which means one, they are not cheap but on the downside I dont wear heavy earrings. I will keep them cause it’s only seasonal."
4.0,I like it but wish the hood was more tighter then it is
4.0,"The color is absolutely beautiful and the fabric is lovely. i am 5'8 and they are long enough and not too much fabric for belly dancing. Definitely for performance, not every day wear. The waist is very very large on me but it has a pull string so that is okay as long as I am wearing a hip scarf to cover the waist band.<br />The elastic around the ankles, though, was so loose that you could easily fit a brick through it, which I think is dangerous for dancing because if your foot slips in it can get caught inside the pants leg. Thus, I cut little holes on the inside where the elastic was and pulled it tighter and then tied it. Easy fix."
4.0,Fits well with narrow feet. Not the list comfy shoes but good enough for flippers.
4.0,Loved the style. I plan to re-order a large.
4.0,I love this tiny earrings. It’s a bit hard to close but once it’s closed it doesn’t open anymore. I don’t take them at all don’t even feel them while I sleep. Good product
4.0,This was the best beanie for my nephew for his mountain biking trips! He loved it very much.
4.0,Didn't fit as expected and are quite fragile but the glasses themselves were a good product. Try them on elsewhere before purchasing because they fit a very specific face shape.
4.0,Good product. Top is too short/small
4.0,I bought my usual 2X and it fit perfectly. I love that it is lined and hits me at my knees. If you are at least 5’4” or over it will fit over the knee. It’s not too flouncy and does not make my bust look bigger than it is. I just hope I will be able to keep cool I  the summer when I use it as the polyester feels just a little cheap.
4.0,The fit was good and the color was as represented. Delivery was fast and careful. I love these shorts plus they have pockets!
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and well made!<br />The seller sends a separate email after purchase to ensure they can custom fit the dress to your exact measurements - this is very important! I highly recommend giving them your personal measurements instead of just ordering based on the size guide!<br />They are happy to help and resolve any issues that may arise, but if you submit your measurements you won’t have any issues and will be able to enjoy this beautiful dress!"
4.0,I thought  I got my  money's worth in quality and variety.
4.0,Nice shirt. Roomy fit. Very comfortable!
4.0,Fit was perfect! Just not high waisted as advertised.
4.0,Nice.  Thin material but perfect for what I wanted it for.
4.0,The gloves were long enough. They are pretty thick and warm. I used them for a costume and they went perfectly well with it. The only issue I would say is that they were a bit tight on the arms.
4.0,I like these.  Plan on  getting more.
4.0,These boots are so cute. They look just like the picture. Size runs true. I only returned them<br />because my daughter did not like them.
4.0,Looks dressy.  Comfortable.  Would have given 5 stars but it slips around on my wrist unless I fasten tight.  I just don’t like tight fitting bracelets.
4.0,"It's a bit form fitting for work, but as an out and about dress this is great! Comfy, soft and breathable."
4.0,Cute. Love the bag it came in. Wish it was bigger. It was not as big as expected
4.0,Comfortable and durable. Not much for looks but that's not what I bought it for.
4.0,"They are as described or expected, reading reviews I am careful with them. There very pretty and will work perfect und my dress for masquerade. Now I am a size 12 no thigh gap but my thighs barely touch. I have cupcake hips and lack of for booty. I'm 5 2 150 about in weight. These will fit however no matter how careful you are the crotch is very thin coming together. In the center it's very fine and though I have not worn them I can imagine when I use them long enough for the event the middle will rip. However I'm wearing shorts in my dress so no biggie. Great for one or two time use, if your looking for something as a permanent solution these might not be for you. I'm not looking to use them that much so it works well for me. Hope this helps I'll attach photos one of the look one of the crotch area to show what I'm saying.<br /><br />Edited: I forgot, under my long dress I am wearing yoga shorts that cover most my thighs.... like bicycle shorts.... there longer shorts help form my shape and are about half way down my thigh. These are perfect to keep them rubbing the jewels together and short enough for most dresses. If you thighs touch more then half way down longer shorts be a solutio. However bicycle shorts should work for most girls around my size being a twelve or smaller...."
4.0,"I really need a good sunglasses since I live in Arizona ( it’s over 110F everyday for this week). I am glad I got this sunglasses. It’s very light and comfortable that I can wear it for a long time. (some heavy and tight sunglass gives me a headache) The quality seems good and not easily broken. Also, it looks good and fit for both genders that I can share this sunglasses with my parents.  so that my husband can share with me sometimes.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,They last long time and worked great for my feet helped take some pain away
4.0,It really is cute. It's for my granddaughter so I hope she likes it
4.0,All three of my girls loved them<br />One 47<br />One 9<br />One 5
4.0,"Adequate bag, excellent product for the price."
4.0,"Nice, tore easily after one use though. Stretchy but sensitive."
4.0,"The socks are great and when I wore them at this event, It was very comfortable. I just have to say that the material feels a bit weird and because I have larger legs, it didn't fit in some areas. It slid down a few times, so I had to constantly pull them back up. Overall, great product though!"
4.0,"Ordered small. Top fit good, bottoms a little baggy. I wear 32b bra and small bottom usually"
4.0,Nice knitted material but very snug at the ends.
4.0,"I ordered a large in black and it fit perfect ( usually wear a medium). Liked it so much, I ordered it in green, but it is totally a different fit. Alot smaller and 4 inches shorter, but still says Large ! I was very disappointed and afraid to re order. I do love the black one though !"
4.0,This paisley strap is super cute for spring or summer. Im a nurse so I like to switch them up as it's the only accessory I get... the only thing I would mention is that this band is not as soft as others I have bought.
4.0,FAIRLY  good materials and consrtuction. Not even a month old and the raise and lower mechanism is getting stuck in the up position. The sand bag cover is cloth held on with clips and elastic.
4.0,Nice shorts for the price. Love the zipper pockets. The leg cuffs could be a little tighter. But good deal over all.
4.0,I just received my orange socks and they are really more of a coral/dreamsickle color than the orange in the photo.  Nice socks and I'll give them to my wife instead of returning.
4.0,"My older son uses these for baseball and they are perfect!  He keeps them on his hat brim while in the outfield and they have never gotten in the way or fall off!  Nice, especially because they were so cheap!<br /><br />UPDATE 4/29/16 - I have now ordered a 2nd pair of glasses for my 9 year old.  Not because there was anything wrong with the first set...except that he lost them! lol.  These are the only kid sunglasses that I've found that fit him as perfect as these do.  When he is out in the field and doesn't need them on, they also fit snuggly over his hat on his visor!  I did take away one star because they raised the prices from last time, which is a bummer."
4.0,Its pretty good for a cheep wallet. I used this for my 3 months traveling in europe and it can fit your passport as well as some currency with ease. I picked it because of the included coin pouch since they use so many coins in the EU. No complaints for the price. However now the strap has begun pealing apart - it is obviously not high quality. Fine for a nice-looking wallet that doubles as a clutch but not a long-term solution.
4.0,Only 4 stars because it has stained around the top part of the rim and Ive only worn it a few times.  Washed it and it didnt come out.
4.0,"As it is increasingly difficult to find white boxer shorts, this is a particularly good value.  Even when I can find a pack of large shorts in a store, it costs quite a bit more than these did."
4.0,The only problem was that it was not dark blue... it was purple !
4.0,"I bought this dress for an event I am attending that stated ""must wear pink"". It is ok for the price, I will make it work. I am 5'4 and it seems a bit short, I can wear flats. It also runs big if you are going by the sizing. I am normally a 12-14, I was going to order the L, but was worried about the 27"" waist. I ordered the XL and the waist, is elastic and larger tha 29.5"".<br />I could've gotten the L or even the M would have fit, but would have been too short."
4.0,"This dress is interesting. The fabric is very lightweight and has an interesting textured pattern. The fabric looks like it should be thicker and heavier than it is. I ordered this dress in burgundy. The color is a deep red. The fabric is thin and breathable but not see through. There are raised wavy stripes in the same color that add a texture and depth to the fabric. This dress has nice sleeves. They are not quite cap sleeves but not as narrow as a sleeveless dress either.<br />I am about 5’6.5” tall and weigh about 140 pounds. I typically wear a medium in dresses. I ordered an extra-large in this dress. The extra-large is a tiny bit larger than I had hoped, but I was right in between sizes according to the size chart so slightly large is better than not fitting. The back has a nice scooped shape at the neckline while the front has a higher neckline. The dress is longer than knee length on me. It goes a couple of inches past my knees. I wish the dress was knee length like the description, but it looks fine the way it is.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Cute dress. I am 5'7&#34; and 140lbs, I bought a medium and it fits perfectly. It is a comfortable dress and the price is great. The problem I have with it is that the loops that hold the belt in place are fragile and break easily. It is an easy fix if you can sew or use a safety pin. I also like my dresses to be a tad longer but this is a common problem for me since I am thin and tall. Overall I really like the dress. I have worn it twice to church and got compliments in it."
4.0,"This suit is comfortable and very smoothing. It doesn't have much strength to hold the jiggles in very much, only just a little bit. But I still like how it smooths me and is very comfortable. I plan on buying another one on payday!"
4.0,"I'm 5'7, 172 lb I ordered a lg and it was too tight.  I should have ordered an xl but the dress looks really good on.  I really like.  I want to order another but white is the only color for the size I need and i have enough white dresses already,"
4.0,The price is right and love the ring.
4.0,Too small of a fit for a 3X
4.0,"I bought this for my husband when I got him an Apple Watch. He really likes it and uses it for nicer occasions when he still wants to wear his Apple Watch. The leather feels a little cheap but for the price and the look, it’s worth it."
4.0,"The quality of the jewelry seems good, all piece arrived, although one of the balls was off but it screwed back on. I was looking for replacement jewelry for a septum piercing that was a horseshoe shape so that it could be flipped upward and out of view for occupational reasons. I have a fairly narrow nose/cartilage and never had the issue before with other jewelry, but does not fit. Therefore it also doesn't hang down as much as I'd anticipated. Otherwise adorable and the gauge sizing is accurate. Might be better suited for an eyebrow or cartilage piercing."
4.0,"Takes a bit of getting used to, but they're really comfortable."
4.0,Watch is wonderful. Just need numbers illuminated more on digital clock and the seconds
4.0,"Great backpack, light weight but tough."
4.0,"Like the design of this retro band shirt. Gave as a gift and he loves it!<br />I thought it was a bit expensive, nearly $30, more than I would normally pay for a t shirt, but worth it to see the smile on his face."
4.0,"I do recommend this product from niceEshop.<br /><br />The earrings in the picture looks about the same as the one I received.<br />However, there are two differences:<br />1) In the picture, there's yellow jewels. The earrings that I received had light colored mucus jewels instead. But I don't really mind. Plus, the jewels on the feather in the picture seems to be multicolored. The one I received had only 3 different colors. (The light blue jewel disappeared!)<br />2) The glue on one of the peacock's feather is too apparent! I can see the glue covering up the jewel!<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,"These earings are very tiny however absolutely beautiful, they look very chic on"
4.0,Daughter loves her purse.
4.0,its very light weight and comfortable. I like the idea of no collar making it like a TeeShirt. It does not have buttons all the way down so its a pull over and pull off. Its all cotton  so on the first time in the dryer it will be on low heat and a short time. The style is new to me but I plan on wearing it to the beach so its ok. I dont like the useless button on the shirt pocket so I many remove it.  I am 6' 205lbs and generally can fit in L shirts but I ordered a XL because I wanted it loose. Thank goodness I did because shirt runs small. A XL fits but tighter than I wanted. I was thinking loose and baggie. If you have wide shoulders it can be tight as the XL is  a bit tight in the shoulders. So size up your order. Other comments might say the same thing.
4.0,"I got this to dress up on Halloween. It was fun and scary for that. An inexpensive rubber mask that can fold up easily in your pocket. However, I have found this mask useful around the house for scaring the wife and children, which is simply delightful."
4.0,The belts are nice for the price. It took along time to recieve the product though
4.0,"This is a cute set. It makes me think of the beach. One of my children love the Kid Nation line. He gets excited anytime a new piece comes in our home and searches out the logo. The material is soft, but thin. It's great for warmer days and helps my children stay a little cooler. I honestly don't know if it's supposed to be pajamas or play clothes, but my children mostly use them for play clothes. My two oldest children typically wear size 8. The large(8-10) is usually best for them, as opposed to the medium(7-8). Kid Nation clothing tends to run a little on the small side, so I'd recommend going up, especially if in between sizes.<br /><br />While there's nothing fancy about this set, it's a nice quality(at least in the play/pajama realm). My children have found it comfortable and we've been pleased with it."
4.0,"I had ordered this sweatshirt for my boyfriend. I usually don't buy clothes online for other people, because it is difficult to know if it's the right size, material etc. I was surprised the material is really nice and it's thick. I noticed someone said they run big in size. My boyfriend wears a large and I ordered a large. I was afraid it looked big but he had tried it on and loved it. It was a perfect fit. It looks great!"
4.0,They are very pretty but i wish the bar was a little longer as well as the other part. It fits a little snug around my nipple irritating the one.
4.0,"I really liked the color and style of this, but it needs to be a lot longer in order to be worn as a dress. I'm 5'11 and it does not fully cover my behind."
4.0,Very nice watch. Simple and clean design. Not bulky. The bezel is little smaller than I thought it would be. Not for a person with a big wrist or forearm. It would look best on the slim/thin person. Worth the price and happy with my purchase.
4.0,"First time I've ever attempted a 2piece, I like how much it still covers. I'm 5""6 169lbs and usually wear a medium in regular clothes, and Large in swimwear. I read the reviews and ordered and XL, and it fit great."
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought it was gonna be, but ok."
4.0,"Bigger ones are ugly, they all have longer posts, which I like"
4.0,"was a little small but otherwise great, plain yoga shirt."
4.0,Really comfortable. Both second pair for bother.
4.0,"I've already gotten many comments about my ""solid gold"" watch, and I think it looks great too. The light isn't the greatest as it is not backlit and comes from the side. Unfortunately I scraped this against a wall at work and now the casing is scratched. But it's cheap, so what do you expect? Has all the essential features and the strap fits me perfectly."
4.0,"I would have absolutely loved it if it was not so big. I can't imagine anyone with a wrist that large. On the plus side, prompt delivery no issues with vendor."
4.0,"fits as expected if you read the reviews and order like 8 sizes up. I'm not a small gal but generally wear a large. 3XL in this suit. But it's cute. There's a funky vinegary smell that did not completely go away after the first wash, but has dissipated now that it has been washed several times."
4.0,"I bought these for beachwear. I was hoping they would be a bit looser/flimsy/beachy but they're more of a loose fit. They have decent deep pockets, elastic waist but with the ribbon style belt attached, it looks less matronly-waistband. Love the color, it'll go with allot. They're made of durable material but not heavy. The length is just right for me. I like my pants a bit long. I'm 5'5 and they sit on my waist and go to my heels. All-in-all it was a good choice."
4.0,Some difficulties with adjusting the band. But overall a very nice looking watch
4.0,Beautiful necklaces I love them and I'll never take them out but I see I got them tangled up
4.0,Runs really big not true to size at all<br />The blue underneath is a xl mens shirt<br />Nice fabric and design that's all
4.0,"These were perfect for a bridal shower. Good quality. Got small blisters on the side of my toes the first time wearing but bandaids cusioned fine. Kind of hard to walk in, flip flop like, but that’s also to be expected with mules. Looked cute."
4.0,These earings are adorable and I can’t wait for my daughter who is obsessed with cats to open and use on Christmas!
4.0,Product fits great.  Thicker than expected.  The ankles are bunch so you can only wear them with boots.  The black pair stinks. I’m hoping washing them will take the smell out
4.0,"Great suitcases except the zipper on one ripped off while in transit. Could’ve been TSA’s fault, could’ve been a mix of the two. Made me mad as it was the first time using them."
4.0,"I sort of love it :0)  This is just a very pretty, fun piece of costume jewelry. I had never had an emerald, real or created in a lab, and it is the birthstone of two wonderful beings who I love very much - so I wanted a stackable band with teeny stones I could add to my aqua bday band. .... what can I say, I was distracted by this  not at all teeny stone! :0)  It does remind me of the Duchess of Cambridge's ring, great size, feels comfortable - I hope that helps anyone who is curious about the ring. Buy it, costume jewelry is fun fun fun and you can have something in every color!! :0)<br /><br />Thank you to the seller, I will definitely buy from you again."
4.0,I love how this looks on. It's a bit heavy but that's expected.
4.0,"Looove it. Super cozy and so warm.<br />I haven’t washed yet.  It is made well.  Not true to size. I say size down. Its rather big on me. But I will keep the medium, because it just so cozy.<br />Next one I order will be a small."
4.0,"I love it, but the material tear easy"
4.0,I bought another LeSportsac and this one came as expected.  Nice design.
4.0,Had to glue them since the last pair fell off.  They do make the glasses feel much more comfortable!
4.0,"Fits very well. Very sexy dress. Looks good out, I wouldn't wear it to work or church"
4.0,Love love love this cape I only gave it 4 stars because I don’t like the way it connects in the back and it’s super long other than that I love it and I say ORDER
4.0,Should be wider
4.0,Bought these with a neckless for my mother- liked that these have a locking backing- sad that they are to hard to spin on- lost a back even though they were locked on- also very thin post- bend easy- worried they will brake with to much use
4.0,"The top fits great! But the bottom was a bit snug.(I also have a big butt) But all in all I was satisfied with it it’s very soft, and great to sleep in! And my hubby liked it too!<br />So yes I would recommend getting it!"
4.0,Looks good..... But i dont like the ribbon tie in back. Makes it bulky and weird....too much hanging in back.  Would hve been better done with a chain clasp of some sort!!
4.0,"Wish this fit.  I got an XL, I am size 8, 150lbs, 36D, 5'5&#34;.  XL didn't fit."
4.0,I though it'd be a little bigger bUT it fits snugly. Not a bad thing just a little small for me and my super thick hair.
4.0,The dress fit somewhat small. Very cute off shoulder dress. I wore this for Easter and got many complements. I would not put in the dryer or dry cleaning.
4.0,just is a bit too small but fast delivery good price.
4.0,Great shirt with good quality graphics
4.0,Pretty cute. Comfortable. Jewels loose.
4.0,"This product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. My only complaint is that I don't care for the clasp, which is some kind of screw on/screw off contraption. But, it is actually way prettier in person than even the picture. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"Good variety.  I got several doubles in my pack and several Marijuana and kid inappropriate ones i threw away; but for the price, it was still a good deal."
4.0,"I like everything except it puts too much pressure on the center of the forehead, which will rub your skin raw with added weight like a headlamp.  Otherwise its great"
4.0,Photo color was not accurate.
4.0,"Fits good over all, Nice length and lace bodice was surprisingly not itchy. Got many compliments on the dress."
4.0,"I really like this tunic!  The fabric is very soft and stretchy.  I am 5'4&#34;, 195 lbs. and ordered and XL.  I could have probably gone with a XXL as it doesn't cover my bum as well as I'd prefer (it comes just below and I'd prefer it to come at least halfway down my thigh) and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5. The packaging was very nice a zipper bag- and came with a free gift, a very cute beaded necklace.  I will definitely order from this company again!"
4.0,"Overall it fit a little more snug than I expected and was more stretchy than I anticipated. However, very comfortable and I do like it a lot"
4.0,Very warm.  Very comfy.  Perfect width.
4.0,"Great mask, gets real bright & looks great in total darkness. Looks like a giant mask when not in the dark. Arrived fast, as described, & in great condition."
4.0,As always miss elaine says it all. Perfect weight and I enjoy it now but will really love it when it warms up in Iowa
4.0,It doesn’t look as good as the one in the picture and quality not that great (with it was a bit more breathable fabric) but good for the price
4.0,"Began having calf issues when running. They are not as heavy as I was expecting, but can't beat the price for 3 pair. They fit as expected, though not as strong as I'd hoped. They still get the job done so I am pleased with my purchase."
4.0,front pouch a little small
4.0,I love the style snd fit. The only problem I have is with the type of ribbon they used for the tie doesn’t stay tied. I will eventually cut it off and sew it together.
4.0,exactly the same as pictured the gems fall out easy but good for the price.
4.0,Great color and style.  Band comes in at 6in. The average wrist size is 5 in. Thus most people would have to resize it. I did it myself and that was a lot of work. Speidel please ship this item at 5in.
4.0,I ordered an xlarge.it was to big I returned it.<br />Corset is pretty though.
4.0,I like thx
4.0,Long and awesome. Somewhat in danger of snagging and unraveling though. The exact vibrancy pictured.
4.0,Bought these cause I'm a huge fan of stone jewelry. I was impressed. They are very durable. Cute. And definitely worth the price. I recommend these to anyone. They actually look like the photo too. (:<br /><br />UPDATE: still really good condition. I have two that the metal is changing color slightly. Just not noticeable to any one else.
4.0,Just as pretty in person as they are in the pictures. But were too snug for me.
4.0,1 dress is missing the jewel piece.
4.0,Liked everything except one mask is missing one slider adjuster.
4.0,Cute...bought as a birthday gift.
4.0,Very nice. Soft & comfortable! Bought in four colors.
4.0,"The shirt is super cute and very, very soft. However it runs a bit small. I got a 2x to have the shirt be loose however it fits much more snuggly."
4.0,I just received this poncho yesterday and I love it!! It came earlier than expected. It does run a little small but that’s ok it still fits my 2 year old! I actually ordered the 6-12 month because my daughter is tiny! It fits good but I probably should have gotten the 12-18 month! I think I will order the red in 12-18 months!
4.0,My wife didn't actually wear them.  She got what she liked online from Kohl's.
4.0,"I am 5'1&#34; and 128lbs, it was not too long but it is just way baggy, so I am going to make some alternation by myself, to shape a back side around waist area so it will make a little curve, instead of boxy figure. But the design and material are perfect, I am happy with this purchase."
4.0,I am 5'3 and it touches floor. Large fit me as expected with my maternity weight 175 pounds Arrived smelling with someone's perfume and pocket is torn.No tags.
4.0,This is a great costume. I bought a medium due to everyone stating the jacket ran small. The jacket does run a size smaller. The pants were big but I just rolled them. I'd definitely purchase again.
4.0,"I run in the dark every morning.  In the past I used cumbersome lights that were not comfortable or sometimes fell off.  I really liked the idea of a wearable wrist light.  I originally bought one of these from an outdoor store while traveling and absolutley LOVED it.  It lasted for ~6 months.  Unfortunatley I only bought 1.  So when I found these on Amazon I was thrilled.  While the seller did a good job delivering, I'm not sure if it was the age of the product or the movement while shipping, but the light was near the end of the lifecycle when delivered and lasted only ~30 days.  Bottom line - Great light but only if it's fresh."
4.0,These glasses are very cute. Comfortable to wear. The color is as pictured.
4.0,These socks have a light compression and are comfortable.
4.0,I ordered the size large I am 510 160 pounds and it did not fit me in length. It cut up me… I just ordered an extra large I will see how that works and write something later… Other than that it’s really cute
4.0,"This shirt washes up perfectly, does not draw lint to it and hangs nicely. I am 5'8"" 130lbs, and 35 chest, Usually wear a small, 2/4 or so and on Amazon typically choose the 4-6 or small size.  After consulting the sizing chart with the ad, I ordered the medium.  It's a good fit, but as I mentioned, the neck is tight. Too tight and the stitching is not stretchy or flexible. This is a bummer. I did rip at the neck and may just fix it. Such a bummer to have a great shirt, great fabric and a restricting, strangle collar.<br /><br />The length is great, arm length and everything else. The ad is accurate, photos are of the exact item I received, and the colors is accurate for the item I received, which is the wine color.<br /><br />4 stars"
4.0,"It's really pretty, but the stone inside the pendant is loose so it can move freely and can end u flipped or looking a little off sometimes. It is really cute, but beware the gem has a mind of its own! Because it is loose I was worried it might fall out, but after months of wearing the gem is still there, the chain has held up, and most importantly, my skin did not change colors! (My skin eats through most metals making my skin go greenish blue, but this one held up :D )"
4.0,"Only gave it four stars because it isn't oversized, it fits like a regular sweater. The fabric is very comfortable and not too heavy either. I wear this sweater all the time."
4.0,"I should have ordered a medium... The small is okay, just a bit tight. Otherwise, I love the look and feel of it. I am 5'3"" , 125 pounds, bust is 35"" . I am ordering a medium... Hope it's not too big!"
4.0,Thank you for the bracelet. It looks very cute as a gift for my niece.
4.0,So great jacket with a great fit - versatile. Only thing is I put a surgical mask in the pocket and that became orange from the Lindt of the fabric.
4.0,This was a good quality shirt but it runs very small.
4.0,They look great but it wasn't color I ordered
4.0,"I love this watch, but I have to watch out for the buckle part as it's really long and catches on my clothes. But I get a ton of compliments on it."
4.0,Not a bad belt for the price...it lasted one week out in construction...the fit is perfect
4.0,"I love the bottom of it, but the top is quite bulky and no North Face material I am very used to. It is not that comfortable and after a wash, you will be able to see what I mean. It's too bad they didn't go for a different design instead of a mash-up of these too. It is still warm if that is what you were looking for."
4.0,I bought these to do my physical therapy exercises at home. They work for what I need them for which is laying on the floor using then to strengthen my legs. However I do have to stop sometimes because they do not stay in place. This is a good value though for the price if your not hard core working out.
4.0,"nice item didnt fit right , top, bottoms fit fine"
4.0,"simple, convenient, keep time well, correct length when pinned to chest for easy no hands viewing when working on a client."
4.0,"It’s unique and good quality, a little larger than I had pictured but the recipient was very happy.  Super cute."
4.0,"I wanted a more watch looking band!! It fits snug enough to monitor my sleep and heart and step still, but way more stylish!! Hopeful about the metal not fading! SUPER CUTE"
4.0,This is a beautiful shoe. I bought it for my 2 year old daughter to match with her backpack. I always buy a half size up and it fits her just the way i wanted it to.
4.0,It was a little small but I'll make it work.
4.0,"Really nice quality, but a little too big... It's almost cartoony. Still it's really cute, although next time I'll probably get the dark one. Great for cosplay or Halloween!"
4.0,"Quality of material and color is awesome, but it just didn’t fit me right. Didn’t seem stitched the best. I have hour glass measurements (34” bust, 29” waist, and 42” hips). Overall it fit ok, yet I didn’t like how the inside seam of the top was revealed along the edge in the front when I wore it"
4.0,Love them comfy and easy to clean for those days in the month however they fit a little too big and I requested a small :(
4.0,"Nice for when you want a light layer between you and your shoe. Cute, slouchy cuffs. Only gave them four stars because they run a little small (I'm a size 9.5 shoe and these only come in one size -- I can just wear them, but the cuffs are lower on my leg than in the picture) and because there weren't more color choices. Still, nice pack of cute, lightweight, soft cotton socks for the money."
4.0,I should have gotten a Medium (thinking it was a men's small). It was TIGHT on me. But very nice! The color is more purple than burgundy.
4.0,The metal used to make this beautiful piece has a little weight to it but the neckalace it comes with is a bit on the cheapie side.  This is the only reason I gave it a 4-star.
4.0,Fit so well and so comfy!! Returned because I’m not sure the camo pattern is really for me. Got lots of compliments on it though!
4.0,Not very heavy and pretty thin but it looks great and fits well
4.0,Light weight low cost option
4.0,"Fit great, nice color"
4.0,"I sent this one back and got a replacement of one that was a size bigger, I got blue bottoms instead too because skulls aren't my thing(it was hard to tell). But I'm really excited that the bottoms go up so high!"
4.0,Fit pretty good long enough for leggings I got an XL I'm 5'7&#34; 150lbs. I just wish the lace was attached to the sleeves better the lace flips up. I will probably end up sewing them down myself.
4.0,"Cute dress.  I wore it to a white party and I paired it with a petty coat under to add a bit of fullness.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5* rating was the fit was a bit large.  If you're between sizes go with the smaller.  I'm wearing a small, but should have ordered the XS. Now I know as I'll use this retailer again.  Wear a white or nude undergarment as white can be pretty see through.  The dress looks like the picture and it's a quality garment."
4.0,It looks just like the pictures. The fit is pretty good with the exception of tight upper arms. The fabric is a bit cheap. It’s a decent casual dress. Not for dressing up.
4.0,"Love the bag! It's a little smaller than  I was expecting but that's all to the good since I tend to cram misc. stuff into ones that are bigger! Adjustable strap is a plus for doing cross body, shoulder, or just to carry as a hand bag."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; with medium sized lower legs. These comes up to my mid calf when scrunched a little.excuse the shoes, they're just for demonstration. Very cute and not itchy."
4.0,"There was a crease on the material on one side, however the bag is beautiful. It comes nicely packaged and it is just like the photo. Beautiful to behold."
4.0,"This product is so good for sneakers! I use it on my triple white nmd r2s, my beige prestos, my white stan smiths and my gazelles and it cleans them so well! works especially well on off white and beige! the first three pics are before and the last 3 are after"
4.0,"Comfortable, though the heal is a bit high.  Would have preferred a flatter heal with the arch support. Then would have been perfect."
4.0,Longer than the picture
4.0,"Really cute shirt, fits well. It is cheap material but you get what you pay for"
4.0,Love it but it tends to keep coming down
4.0,This sweater is super cute but it's very large. I ordered a large thinking it would fit me as it does on the model but I look more like a tent! It feels like a XL or XXL on me. The fabric is soft and it looks cute so I will keep it to wear it with leggings but you may want to consider going one size down. The Large is VERY large!
4.0,"These are pretty tight, but I'm into it. Smelled pretty bad upon delivery, but went away with a wash. True to size."
4.0,"I like this top very much but it does run big. It is also see-thru so if you order white you will need a tank top under it. Overall I am pleased, but I would order a smaller size next time."
4.0,"They are very well made and strong but werw a little smaller than another one I had, which was made by same company. Still works for grocery shopping and misc but holds less."
4.0,Too small gave it too my daughter
4.0,"The sleeves are a little short, but overall this item is ok."
4.0,Classy looking for a silicone band. Very comfortable. Size adjustment is quite a chore but if you have a lot of patience it's worth it. It's the pins that attach to the buckle that are difficult to line up when you put the strap back together. A tiny flat blade screwdriver helps.
4.0,The packaging consist of a tiny pouch it's pretty cute!
4.0,These shorts are really pretty. I love the bird pattern. They look really nice in person - It’s a really cute shade of blue.<br /><br />The material seems very cheap and like these won’t last for more than a year or so.<br /><br />Also the button might be on the opposite side of every other pants I’ve ever owned.
4.0,"First off, these are from China so follow their instructions on sizing because it makes a difference. I normally wear a M but in Asia that is considered an L so I made sure to order the L size. This is my first set of thong underwear and I wanted to know what the big deal about thong underwear was. I tried a pair on and the pouch was snug. There's two gap holes in the pouch area that is weird looking and if you want to look sexier, you got to shave that area off. The g-string part took a while to get used to but after a while, you sometimes don't even notice. I still re-adjust whenever it rides up so that's a downside. But I'm starting to see and feel why some men and women like wearing thongs. It does feel comfortable and like you're wearing nothing at all and you don't get that occasional annoying feeling from briefs. It's snug enough to be comfortable and minimally annoying. The material is rayon-like so it has that smooth feel to it."
4.0,"I already had few reusable/foldable grocery bags from a different company, but most grocery bags come in a pack of 5 or 6. This was the only one that came in a pack of 3 so I gave it a try. For most part it’s good. Sturdy and carries a lot of weight/items. But they dont fold well. They didn’t come prefolded as the other grocery bags and the material is quite a lot thicker than others. Because of this, its quite hard to fold them and stuff it in the pocket. Its actually quite annoying and took up a lot of my time ."
4.0,I love pretty much all he styles of JS. Very pleased!
4.0,Looks lovely but gets scratched up easily.
4.0,These glasses look good on but they feel very cheap.  What do I want for the price?
4.0,Runs small pretty fabric though
4.0,little large but i loved the material and the pattern. Got a lot of compliments
4.0,I really love this bag. It saved my shoulders on a long trip to NYC. I think it would be great if it had a few more interior pockets for this and that.
4.0,"Great jewelry stand. My only complaint is that it is not heavier, as it can topple over. But overall I love it."
4.0,"I’m 5’5” and 165lbs. Bought these because I read the reviews about how nice they fit larger legs. They’re very nice quality and go up pretty high, however there’s two elastic bands on the top part, one at the very top and one where the main stocking starts, that add a little bit of pudge in between. I probably won’t be wearing the white ones because of this until I hit my weight loss goals, but overall the black ones are not as noticeable.<br /><br />They’re super cute and nice, and if the top was just solid material without the bands it would be 5/5."
4.0,It was a gift. I think it's pretty cute.
4.0,"Nice soft silky texture. Picture is easy to see, nice and clear. Runs a little big."
4.0,"I purchased this watch because I was looking for a casual and chic looking watch to wear to work.  It arrived fast and looks just like the picture, but it was also way too big for my wrist.  Granted, my wrists are tiny, measuring about 5.5&#34; around.  I loved the look and the quality seemed decent for the price, but it just kept sliding around my wrist like a bangle, so I decided to return it.  I wish I could fit it, but I definitely recommend it if your wrists are a little bit more average size!"
4.0,"These are great if your shoes are fitted. My only caution is that once you take your shoes off, they socks will fall off rather quickly. That is the only reason for the 4 stars. I will absolutely buy them again!"
4.0,"Very nice custome very good quality,not made for busty women"
4.0,"I bought this as part of a Rapunzel Costume and it worked out great! Basically it was comfortable and easy to put on, and looks great. The corset itself is thick and sturdy and the pattern on the pink fabric is beautiful. The only things I didn't like was the zipper is easily seen, (no fabric to cover it,) and sometimes the sleeves were hard to keep in place, but that's what safety pins are for. Either way I'd recommend this to anyone looking to costume themselves in an easily removable corset."
4.0,Timer stopwatch
4.0,"Awesome shoe, but order up at least 1 full size. My son does all sorts of cool tricks with them."
4.0,Cute trendy dress. I'm 5'2&#34; 120#. Small fits well. Fabric is thin/ cheap. That's why I gave 4 stars. Price is unbeatable!
4.0,"Color was a little off but other than that,  great value. Color off"
4.0,I feel really cool when I wear these. And trendy.
4.0,Rugged and cool looking. Order size up the waist is tight and has NO stretch.
4.0,"My daughter is a solid size 10. Bought for Christmas, and they were way too small. Good thing is they fit me, I wear a 9, so I didn't have to return them.<br />Other than sized too small, I love the boots. They're comfortable and holding up well."
4.0,Super light weight and washable. Love this shoe!
4.0,"My 7 year old daughter wanted this watch. Even on the smallest setting, it's a little too big for her. Hopefully she will still like it when it fits better. She thinks it's really cool!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8a31fe439fec5fa3ee6a3782826d0861]] Overall happy which my purchase, expect the hoops to be bigger but I am kinda happy they weren't. It makes them look more delicate. They don't feel delicate either, but they are very light. I am slightly concerned about them staying clipped but I guess I will just have to wait and see for that"
4.0,liked shirt normally wear a large ordered xlarge was small
4.0,"Fits well, but will always slide down to the elbows."
4.0,I've been wearing shirt stays daily in my uniform for the last 11 years.  These latches hold much tighter than the normal garter style clasp.  My only complaint was on the first day I wore these the tension adjustment piece broke and started poking me in the leg with a sharp corner.  I contacted the seller an they sent me a replacement faster than the original shipment had arrived.  4 stars since the first pair broke but 5 star customer service.
4.0,"5'3"" 118lbs 27 waist, 38 hips. I ordered the black pair in a size small. They are comfortable and the fit is really nice. However, I am disappointed that they are not squat proof. You can definitely see all of my underwear. I will still wear them, but likely not on leg/butt day."
4.0,Soft material but the top is shorter then shown and it doesn’t look as good as it does on the model lol but I used them for separate outfits and they look great with darker colors. I would buy again.
4.0,Wore to an outdoor casual wedding. Very comfortable. Was Larger fit then thought it was going to be. Also was a bit shorter hem line then I like but worked ok with leggings/ tights and boots.
4.0,Loved the design but was disappointed pendant was so small.  Would purchase it again if it came in a larger size. I bought it for myself to use as a key chain in the days after my beloved greyhound died.  But it was too small to be practical....I took it to a jewerly shop and had the hanging ring replaced (it got bent out of shape as I tried to figure out how to use it on a fashion keyring).  I gave it as a necklace to my dog nanny who was equally broken hearted  over the untimely death of my  goofy fun wonderful greyhound.
4.0,Size and I received it quick.
4.0,Very special. The only thing is that it is a little light. I would prefer it it had some weight to it
4.0,Beautiful dress  I take large to x large and it is still too tight  I am normally a size 12  If you order go up a size  nicely made and now have to go through the hassle of returning it :(
4.0,"I bought this for a salsa festival, but it doesn't have enough give in the underarm area for me to dance in comfortably. I do love the outfit though, so I'll wear this on my next girls night. It fits nicely and isn't something I'll have to worry about others wearing in Anchorage to an event. I'm 5'3, 122 lbs. The romper is a good length - my booty isn't all hanging out, so I definitely like that."
4.0,"Nice, not huge which is what I wanted.  Will wear this summer."
4.0,"The watch is great, but the strap is kinda weirdly designed. The side with the holes is much longer proportionally to the side with the buckle, and it makes the tail end of the strap come up too far."
4.0,value value 12.99 i have at least 75 BO-SOX hats  this 1 got great hat much more  than any/ comfortable  fit do not forget 2018W.S. 108 WINS
4.0,"cute and affordable, a little flimsy"
4.0,Night driving with this night vision glasses is a lot easier.  Thumbs up
4.0,Ordered a large based on sizing chart. Should have ordered a Small honestly. Cute top and design though. I ended up returning and not reordering though. The white fabric around the neckline was not as flattering on me as it is on the model in the item photos. For reference I am 5'6 & 155lbs. (short torso) 36D bust
4.0,Super cute and perfect for early cruiser/walker. Run a little big as my 10 month old has pretty cubby feet and still a bit big but still serve their purpose
4.0,"I have been buying the same watch for years. I love Casio, they are cheap and last 2-3 years. The strap usually gives out before the battery. I just set (easy to do) and put on my new watch and the strap is 2cm shorter then the old watch's strap. I am big and can only use the last hole. It makes on-off tougher but for price I will live with it."
4.0,Quedo perfecto tela excelente bello bello
4.0,So far so good with this ring. I have recieved a lot of nice compliments.
4.0,"Purchased the black band with rose gold hardware. Band is stiff but hopefully over time it will soften.  I like the look of the leather. Hardware works fine but the clasp feels cheap and plastic. Hard to get the watch on as the little tab didn't fit in the holes of the band but with a little persistence it worked. Hardware is shiny, watch is not but it doesn't bother me too much. Concerned this band won't pass the test of time but I may just use it for certain occasions."
4.0,Very quick to print.  Does a good job.
4.0,"I weigh 87 kg and my height is 1.85 meter and my size is L or XL. My size is L or XL depending on length sleeves. Body fit is L, but depending on the length of sleeves XL must be sometimes, staying fit a little loose. I bought a size L and the fit is correct for use on a thick sweatshirt or vest. Hoodie is too loose if is used alone on a t-shirt. The length of sleeves is right for a tall person. Fabric is thick and very good for the cold. I recommend buying a size M for use on a t-shirt thin to have a perfect fit, and L for use on thicker clothing."
4.0,I bought a small and I'm typically a size 0 - 2.  (5' tall and 95 lbs.  34C top)  The suit fit pretty well and looks great on.  Material is nice and is made well.  A little hard getting the top on and off....  I would recommend this bathing suit.
4.0,"The 4 durags are great for the price you’re paying for them. I bought mine a while ago, and they’re still going strong. The wave caps are on the bigger side and don’t really fit anybody’s head based on other reviews. What I’ve come to do is putting the wave cap on top of the durag before tying. Mix and match the colors and get extra compression, especially when you’re wolfing."
4.0,Screen print is very stiff even after washing it several times. Good quality fabric though and it fits well.
4.0,Self winding not that good but for the price is good wstch
4.0,Sorry such and soft... but the camel type is strong woth this one... cute color
4.0,Its a beautiful sandals runs a little small. I ended up gifting it to my sister in law. 😏
4.0,"It's very comfy, it's great for cosplay"
4.0,"It isn't as big as you might think based on the marketing -- but it will carry a MacBook pro 15, cables , glasses (in case) and a small notepad fairly well. Not for the type a person who likes to carry extra items like headphones etc. Just the necessities here."
4.0,"Nice for the price. One was missing a couple of the tiny stones, but at the bottom so not too noticeable. Would like tracking info or to know it's coming from overseas before ordering."
4.0,"They run a little big which is not that bad of a thing. I have worn some that were very tight so were uncomfortable to wear, so I like these."
4.0,Nice fit and comfortable. Can be dressed up or down.
4.0,I wear an xl-xxl size 16-18 so it was a gambly to order this. I mostly orered it for the top because I wanted a strapless top that I could tye. The top fit me well enough but the bottoms were a no go.... but the top was good enough
4.0,I ordered my normal size and it has no stretch. Order a size up!!!
4.0,Adorable earrings for the holidays.  Very festive and fun.
4.0,Lollol
4.0,"For the almost free price it is a fine watch, it is cheap plastic construction and the clock loses about 1 second a week compared to a GPS synced clock I use as a reference. I bought it for work because it will break away from my wrist if it gets stuck on something instead of destroying my hand like a metal watch could."
4.0,"They were just fine but arrived a day later than promised so I was not able to give them with the gift I planned but in this case, considering the circumstances, no big deal. They still arrived before Christmas."
4.0,They work as they should.  The hard plastic between your big toe hurts.
4.0,"I have always found it challenging to find stylish sunglasses that work my face shape, but these look great. I like the silver mirrored finish and the polarized lenses offer excellent clarity. The frames are slightly rounder than traditional Rayban Aviators and they are the perfect size for either men or women. Not so large that they are overpowering on a woman's face and they do not make me look like a fly, which is usually the case. However, they are substantial enough to fit most men as well. Even though they are inexpensive, The lenses are a very neutral grey tone and they do not distort or blur my vision many inexpensive sunglasses have. I am thrilled to have found these lightweight sunglasses and highly recommend them."
4.0,My grandson like the shirt but I recommend seizing up one size.
4.0,"These are very cute but ran a little small from what I expected. I am a size 7 with a thin waist and a big booty. I wish they covered my booty a bit more, but I still wear them."
4.0,"Really, really like the durability of these so far. I bought what was listed as &#34;2E&#34;, but they were just regular wide. They really fit like the average shoe, but since the material is soft, it forms to the foot pretty well (I don't have crazy corns/hammer toe or anything, just fat wide feet).<br /><br />Please note that the entire slipper is man-made material. It looks like lamb or wool on the inside, but it feels manmade (it is, proven by the label) and is definitely not as soft or thick as animal hide. That being said, its still very warm and soft, and doesn't have that nasty leather smell that some lamb slippers do. It isn't stated, but these should be vegan, if you are against using leather or any other animal parts.<br /><br />They feel like they will last. The bottom SEEMS like its material, but it is a full, decently thick, rubber sole. It has material glued to the bottom to make them more like slippers, but its full rubber. They look tasteful and sort of remind me of kung fu shoes. Definitely great for indoor and light outdoor stuff. Not the greatest slipper ever - certainly not as good as heavy duty leather slippers/moccs with lamb inners, but seemingly worth the pice due to durability and the warmth is good enough."
4.0,"Great ring, size is perfect and it is well made. My only reason for not rating 5-stars was that the dragon design on it is vague and hard to make out. Other than that I love it!  I would recommend a purchase."
4.0,"Love the shirt but right after having on it's the strap broke, so it up but haven't had any problems cents."
4.0,"I like the hoop that connect in back so the earring cannot slip out of your ear like a fish hook style. They were not as colorful as the picture which was disappointing. Still, I like them very much. They are very light weight."
4.0,A little tight on top. But still like it a lot.
4.0,Very cute!! Fits just right!!! A little belt would be a nice touch!!!! :)
4.0,"I was concerned that this dress may look chintzy, but it is anything but. The color is lovely and material is nice. I wear a 16 and the XXL fit well."
4.0,I love the designs of these! But they are flvery flimsy. So after you out them in taking them out will likely destroy the piece you put in. Which upsets me. One of my pieces has stretches on it because of how thin the material is.
4.0,Kept my head nice and dry!
4.0,"These were not baggy, but were fitting in some places and loose in others. I was also hoping for a warm sweatshirt material. This is that smooth synthetic feel with some fleecy stuff inside. It’s ok for sitting in front of the computer for 8 hrs, but they weren’t something I’d repeat buy."
4.0,These are lovely and a nice size.  They sparkle with all the little crystals and are a breeze to put on.  They do not hurt my ears.  I will wear them for a couple of weeks to make sure they hold up and then I will increase my review.  I say YES so far and got an extra pair as a gift.  My only complaint is they don't come in a cute little gift box.
4.0,The top was way too big (as expected due to my body shape) comparing to the bottom but the bottom was perfect. Loved it and had it mix-matched with another top which worked out beautifully. 😉
4.0,"This top is very pretty.  The floral print is vibrant against the navy blue.  The sheer stripes on the sleeves are a nice touch.  The top drapes well and is feminine and flattering.<br /><br />The fabric is soft and smooth, but has no stretch.  The top runs large."
4.0,These pants are nice and long. I’m 5’10” and they still hit the floor
4.0,"Got this jacket for my husbands company chirstmas party.Great jacket for the price,everyone gave him complements on it.It is cheaply made but it worked an served its purpose.The on/off Switch broke on the battery box first day he wore it,FYI No real pockets,super cheaply made probably will not last more than few wares.Was packaged well,was as the picture shown.."
4.0,The fit was good.  I chose to was on gentle in cold water and line dry.  Turned out nice.
4.0,Beautiful leather jacket at a very reasonable cost. Buy larger than you usually wear but worth it.
4.0,My calves are bigger than average and these fit. Just not long enough to stay up the whole shift
4.0,A little large in the arms but otherwise I love it!
4.0,I use this product for a bracelet.  I lived in japan and was pleased  with the shape it was in.
4.0,This set is super cute and great purchase for the price! I will say that the head wrap is entirely too long! But my girl did get tons of compliments when wearing it!
4.0,"Keeps everything where it needs to be, good buy"
4.0,Quality of material
4.0,This dress is very comfortable and the color is gorgeous!! It does run big though.
4.0,Fortunate enough to wear this at work but one of the bosses complained about it covering the nose so i have to wear it high on the face now instead of how it is meant to be worn but after work i can get away with wearing it low on the busride home which i like because it is more comfortable that way.
4.0,"I really liked the way these pants fit. Would look great with a crop top or something simple tucked in. I ended up returning them because they were too long even with heals and I didn't want to pay for alterations. I am 5' 3"", 130lbs and the medium fit great around, just too long."
4.0,"So from reading the previous buyers reviews on how it runs small, I decided to order 2 sizes up. I would say it’s a pretty dress, but not the best quality obviously for the price, the dress was also quite large on me, proably because instead of ordering 1 size up I ordered 2 sizes up could be the reason. I will have to be the dress hemmed and taken in the shoulder and waist."
4.0,Product looks as described in the photos on Amazon.  It  arrived on time. Pleased with the price and product.
4.0,"It's nice and very cute, but a bit smaller than I'd expected. The color also looks slightly different in person, (I ordered the white) but still has a beautiful iridescent look to it. It came on time and is super cute though, so I'm still very happy."
4.0,Cute color and pattern and the fit is cute too. Material is stretchy and conforms to body.  I would say this runs on the small side. Ended up returning the Small and getting a Med because the small was a bit too tight.
4.0,"I ordered a size up like thr reviews suggest, but it's much too big. I'm going to try to exchange it for the smaller size. Otherwise, it's a nice dress. I would've given 5 stars, but the material is strangely slippery like swimwear."
4.0,"Waste is to large and it isn't high waisted, but very good quality."
4.0,"The shoes are very comfortable, and I think they're really cute. Looks just like the picture. I normally wear an 8. I ordered a 8.5 and they fit perfect. Would of preferred black , but the red was a better deal. They seem very sturdy. The only thing I don't like is the way they lace up, the laces can come undone easily."
4.0,somewhat smaller than expected but still very cute!
4.0,A little disappointed in the size of the charms and construction of it being two bracelets. But I love the centiment.
4.0,"What a very nice shirt! I loved it as soon as I opened the package.Then I held it up.Uh-oh.I tried it on anyway. I ordered an XL and I couldn't get it over my shoulders.And they don't offer 2X. I would probably need a 3X, anyway!The seller did a fantastic job handling the situation.Five stars for them."
4.0,"Fits well, comfortable, flattering"
4.0,Exactly like the picture!! Was a great present for first time mom (my cousin). Even came with a cloth to keep it clean!
4.0,My husband got me this as a bday gift.  It's a nice shirt.  It's not 100 % cotton so it didn't shrink.  Nice quality.  And as a mom of 3 boys it's perfect!
4.0,These are great for dance class and just chilling out at home. Very comfortable and allows for ease of movement. Not very high quality fabric.
4.0,"Beautiful piece, not as shiny and brilliant as I had anticipated but still pretty lovely."
4.0,"I bought this as a holiday gift for an avid Rotty lover and he adores it! My only issue is that it seemed a bit snug on him compared to other XL shirts I have bought him in the past. So far I haven't seen any excessive fading of the design or color from washing it, but only time will tell. Overall I'm pleased with the design, but wish it was more true to size ."
4.0,Very cute and good look and quality.Amaizing for the price!!!Just love it!!!
4.0,"5'10"" pants hit a solid 2 3 inches above my ankles but the material is nice so im keeping them. Thin enough in a good way but not see through. And the waist band is the perfect amount of tightness without smushing my chub"
4.0,These work very well around the water and when I go about in the snow covered lakes.
4.0,"The quality of this wrap is good and as described, but I wish the green was vibrant like the picture. It is a more dull, basic green. It's workable though."
4.0,"The moment I put this dress on I wanted to spin around. It was so fun and the perfect style party dress for a wedding guest. The color is a nice royal blue and the sash is lightweight and detached. The dress fit well and was light and airy. The only downside was the fabric was less than desirable. It seemed thin and potentially easily snagged. I was not sure how it would hold up in the wash, but for the price the one (hopefully more) time wear may be worth it! Returned only because it was one of several dresses I bought to try on for the event. Was definitely a finalist!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress as on picture. Just one thing I was ordered Dark Blue  but dress came in  Rose .<br />My daughter sad she likes this color to,so we not gonna return this dress."
4.0,I’m enjoying wearing these. They are well made and all Lesa Michele’s earrings are packaged as well as more high end jewelry I’ve purchased.
4.0,"Sizing: I'm petite, 5' 3&#34; and weigh around 110 lbs. I purchased the S(FBA) thinking it would fit fine...I was SO wrong. I'm a full B / low C and the cups were way too small. The strap around the back was so tight it definitely gave me a back bulge (which is not flattering in the least). The bottoms fit almost perfect and are cut very high.<br /><br />I still give it 4 stars because overall, it's a super cute swimsuit, the fabric and print were absolutely perfect - BUT if you want it to fit, size up at least one size. I returned mine for two reasons 1) it was way too small and 2) peplum tops are just not flattering on me (I was really hoping I could pull it off but it's just not for my body type)."
4.0,"It fits well, I ordered the XL. I am 5'9. Not a ton of support in the bust and the little cups in there sort of float around so it has to be adjusted often. Overall I like it alot. I ordered the pink floral and it looks like the picture except it is actually peachy-orange color not pink at all."
4.0,"I really like these, they are super cute and look very good on. However, I do question the durability. When I go to clean them, it is clear how thin and weak the lenses are. But at the same time, they were very affordable. So I give them 4 stars. I hope they last!"
4.0,"I have enjoyed wearing these fun, holiday socks. They are colorful and have festive patterns. They are made from a thin, cotton/polyester/elastane blended fabric, so they have just the right amount of stretchiness.<br /><br />The socks are soft and comfortable to wear. They could be worn with leggings, yoga pants and even dress pants. Versatile and fun to wear!"
4.0,"Thin but that's one of the things I liked about it, has been great for the summer days even though it's long sleeved. I wear with thin capris leggings. Also very cute."
4.0,Good quality sweat shirt
4.0,I haven't worn the boots i put them in yet so cannot comment about comfort.  They fit.  Not much more I can say.
4.0,They are cute necklaces. Both are shorter than expected and the black and gold strips on both aren't as dark as in the picture but they still look good! We will probably get different chains because the ones that come with it kind of seem cheap.
4.0,A bit large and covers my head to much I have a medium size head. It is warm and looks cool
4.0,not shoes
4.0,"yuhhh very nice, a bit snug on thicker thighs (mine are around 17"" around), and a bit itchy because they are 80% wool but other than that they're pretty good."
4.0,Love the color and feel of fabric.  A little tight in the chest. If you are a larger breasted gal you will definitely need to go up a size
4.0,Love the dress - very comfortable. A little tight on top but fits. Cute and worth  the price!!
4.0,I am a woman and wear a size 5 to 5 1/2 shoe. I ordered the size Small which they say is the right size for me but it was quite a bit too big so I returned them.
4.0,Loved the look but it runs small and then shrank more when washed.  Loved the look of this but not the fit
4.0,It’s really cute and is extremely comfortable. And I like the material it feels like cotton my only issue is the sizing.. I wear a large maybe an xtra large depends on the brand & material but GET this in the biggest size offered if you wear the same sizes as myself normally I got a 3x and it fits like a large. I have wiggle room but it’s form fitting. So matter what size you are go two sizes bigger or more. Trust me on that lol that’s my only complaint everything else is perfect.
4.0,CUTE AND LITTLE.
4.0,I wore this top for a dinner and received many compliments.  It is a thick fabric but it is pretty breathable.  I love this shirt.
4.0,Taking these on a trip overseas for the flight. They seem good and will work for the flight.
4.0,"She likes it and says it fits good, I think they are a tad big."
4.0,"Washing instructions included in the package:<br />Hand Wash Water Under 30 C<br />Do Not Bleach<br />No Ironing<br />Drying not rolling<br />Hang Dry<br /><br />Pros:<br />+  Warm, Stretchy, and Comfortable to wear<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  Make sure to remember the skirted part when going to the ladies room so the skirt will not touch any part of the bathroom"
4.0,"The blue butterfly stone and beads are great quality. However, this is way too small for me. I typically fit the standard bracelet size, so I recommend this for a teen. I gave it to my 6 year old daughter, it was more fitting for her wrist."
4.0,"Bought this to wear to a music festival, and I love it! Giving four stars because it's a little see through. Hoping it wasn't noticeable."
4.0,"I have several of these.  But, this color.  I should’ve ordered a size larger."
4.0,Nice looking jacket. A little tight in the shoulders but good value.
4.0,A bit tight at the back.
4.0,The bracelet is just as beautiful in person as the picture and look forward to wearing it.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1a6d803bf8df173ba2c756e2d0352530]] Look forward for the toe socks that lasting for long time! First timer buyer.
4.0,"love the pockets, easy to wear.  a little short for my liking, needed to wear biker shorts under it."
4.0,Definitely cannot be interchangeable with yellow gold and looks cheap.
4.0,"I like looks, design, size, and band"
4.0,"Thin, breathable, but slip off my face....<br />More suitable for a man than a woman"
4.0,Mask was a hit got a prize lol<br />It was a little large kinda moved around but I put on a winter cap and it fit pretty good had people freaked out
4.0,"So first off, this really is a tunic and not a dress. Can't be wearing it without tights I reckon, like the model is, else if you put your hands up, say to grab onto the bars in subways or buses for example, you'd end up flashing everyone your tightywhities, unless that's your thing, then okk!"
4.0,"Wowza!  when I first pulled out the packaging, I was nervous that they be too small. But I put them on and they fit! They are very tight on your skin, it reminds me of a pair of jegging‘s I have. So if you don’t like how clingy the fabric is to your skin then you won’t like these pants. I do wish they came in a short version since I’m only 5’2”, since the pants need to be hemmed about 2 inches."
4.0,"Good quality and fast shipping . One size fits all , including children and adults lol. They need more sizes . My 3 year old son could wear this . It’s very tight on my head and I would return if they had a larger size . Other than the sizing it is good quality and the USPS logo is spot on ."
4.0,Nice shirt -- I anticipated it would run a bit small and it did.  Nice quality
4.0,Great for post shoulder surgery. Buttons are cold to the skin but other than that. Great shirts! A little spendy but the quality over rides the price
4.0,"I love this dress and constantly get compliments about it but it's starting to break down really quick, and when I say break down, I mean the fabric gets lind of pill-y or scratchy in places that it rub, like the back from sitting. That's expected, because it is so cheap, so I'm still pretty happy with it. Also I usually order a S or M and a Small was still a little loose around the waist but fits fine around the chest. I'm 5'7 and weigh about 130 lbs."
4.0,"Light weight,  recd a pair that said size 10 inside,  but from what I researched Fox's sizes run funny. Thankfully they fit perfect"
4.0,"Great shirt, really good price."
4.0,"This dress is fine for what I used it for, but I don’t think it would be something I’d wear often. The slit is very high, but I am pretty short. I’m 5’3” 118lbs. The material is fine for the price, but don’t expect something “expensive looking.” I purchased this for a last minute costume I put together (Jessica Rabbit) and I thought it worked really well. I would recommend this to someone who is probably looking to wear it for a costume or as a dress to wear once in a while."
4.0,"I would not dry this dress. It shrunk after washing it. It is a little too short now, but still super cute!"
4.0,"Nice fabric, substantial in weight and very soft. My granddaughter is very picky about the texture of her clothes and these pasted her inspection beautifully."
4.0,Looks nice and fit is slim.
4.0,"I love this shirt, but the print has faded to about the same color as the shirt in less than 5 washes.  It is still there and in perfect condition the color just faded, will not stop me from wearing and enjoying it though."
4.0,"I love these Military galoshes, however even ordering a size 8 for my size 6 work boots, they won't go on. They do fit well, if not a little to long, on my shoes, so I've been wearing those to work in the barn. But I like wearing boots and I'm disappointed that a military over boot, will NOT fit over a boot. Why not size the galoshes (so it fits to the same size boot you are wearing, and make the opening of the boot big enough to accommodate wearing a boot underneath by making it wider? Sigh, why are my feet so hard to fit? That was rhetorical, Don't answer that! Try ordering two sizes larger than your boots to see if that will fit, but the tow will be long. I kind of trip on mine."
4.0,Pretty good gloves for the money.
4.0,"Six pairs, six different sizes ... the difference between the waist measurement of the largest and the smallest was nearly 3&#34;!  Luckily, the elastic is very stretchy.  I can usually wear medium, but I'm glad I ordered large.  If I had ordered extra-large the &#34;string&#34; sides would allow me to take them in to fit perfectly without marring the appearance, so I can suggest ordering up even two sizes if you are concerned.  The seat covers my cheeks comfortably (I HATE wedgiewear!) and the fabric is nice quality silk.  The colors were not identical with the ones shown, but I received six different colors, and I like all of them.  I did get black, white, a more golden shade of brown, a light olive green, a deep dusty rose, and a terracotta."
4.0,The bracelet is real nice. The length of the bracelet really long.
4.0,"They are well constructed and fit well also good looking,<br />Warm and comfortable."
4.0,Recieved before due date. Love this item
4.0,Nice- She loved the necklace and saying.
4.0,"These gloves are at least twice as thick compared to others.  The wrist is a bit tight.  The single finger hold for the little finger works well, even though I thought it might not work.  Even with only one finger in, no skin touches the computer screen and the thickness of the glove prevents triggering buttons on the screen that you don’t want to trigger."
4.0,See through !! Great for a summer beach cover up to throw on when going from beach to dinner or drinks and back to beach.
4.0,"Beautiful skirt I used for Disneyboubding as Elsa for Halloween. I hoped to wear it as more than a costume, but the wrinkles from packaging/shipping haven't disappeared after several wash/steam cycles. It also can carry a big static charge, causing the skirt to cling."
4.0,I get compliments every time I wear this.  Good purchase for the price.
4.0,kinda expensive
4.0,They fit my glasses well. They are slightly larger than my frames but I works! They flip up and stay up when you don’t want them on. I would say the blue shade is a little bright but I love them! Definitely worth it!
4.0,The bracelet is very light weight.<br />Not heavy at all. Clasp is not closing with ease.
4.0,Ordered for a gift. Received on time to mail. I liked the colors and the reversible design of the scarf very much. It is a little smaller but it will layer and knot perfectly. Also the weave was not as tight as I imagined but it is warm and pretty. Thank  you.
4.0,"Top was a generously sized, seemed bigger than normal. Could have gone up a size for my stomach area, but then top would have to be taken in. A slip was 100% necessary as the material is thin. I was very happy with results based on cost. They recommended to go a size up, but I didn’t find it necessary.<br /><br />Length was a little long in front but I chose to just hold up the dress instead of having to taken in, Because when standing still a dropped exactly how I wanted."
4.0,"I like the quality of the garment but it is a little too small. I expect to lose weight so am not returning the items. Quick ship, highly recommend the seller."
4.0,"If you want it to fit loosely, order a size up.  It seems to run a little small in my opinion"
4.0,"Wish sleeves were a tad longer.  Pockets poke out a bit, too. For the price, it was just fine, not great."
4.0,"Nice construction and beautiful fabric. Unfortunately, not suited for the weather I had in mind. I would wear this in the fall over a short sleeve jersey in 55-63 degree weather and certainly not for below 40 degree weather. I'm guessing the front panel might provide a little wind protection, but not much and the sleeves are definitely for temperature regulating and not warmth. So, unfortunately because I already have plenty of fall/early spring riding gear this jacket goes back."
4.0,Bought it as a present for my wife. She seems happy with it.
4.0,"It's awesome! The only thing is that i wish you didn't have to set the time everyday. My boyfriend keeps on having to fix the time everyday, but overall it is an amazing watch, great quality, and my boyfriend keeps getting compliments for his watch. :)"
4.0,"very high back slip, but cute with a skirt underneath"
4.0,"Works great, a little larger neck adjustment would be a plus but I have a large neck I suppose..."
4.0,"Left-side crown, Check<br />Hands run Counter-clockwise, Check<br />Numbers around the dial printed backwards, Not Checked.<br />Just about perfect for my favorite style of watch."
4.0,"I bought size Large, which is a size 8 on the tag.  I am 155 lbs, 5'5, typically wear a size 6/8 and my measurements are 36-30-40.<br /><br />I have problems with Homeyee dresses not fitting properly in the thighs-- Homeyee Large dress measurements are 36-30-37.5, whereas my body's measurements are 36-29.5-39.5 (thick thighs save lives!).  This dress is the tightest of all 12 Homeyee Large dresses I ordered, was much too tight in the thighs and much tighter than other dresses in the arms and shoulders.  I really had to squeeze my arms into the sleeves.  It fit in the narrowest part of the waist and in the chest.<br /><br />I like the style and dark blue color, but the dress does not fit me well.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful."
4.0,"As a nursing supervisor, we are always looking for a nice gift that doesn't break the bank and isn't the same old, same old. These key chains were a nice change to give in appreciation of our hardworking staff.<br />Seem well made and came in a gift box"
4.0,Much smaller than I thought they would be but I'm wearing them.
4.0,Can't complain! Not superb quality but decent quality for a decent price
4.0,just as I expect
4.0,"I was originally worried that the skull on the ring would be too small, but it’s HUGE. It goes really high. The quality of the ring is great though! I’ll definitely still wear it. Just wish the skull was a bit smaller."
4.0,I love the style and it is substantial sweatshirt fabric. My only complaint is that sweatshirt fabric looks a little shiny. Still nice enough.
4.0,"I am happy with these earrings, Would  order them again if I had to"
4.0,This band is exactly what I was looking for. It was very difficult to find a Velcro option for the charge 2. It attached easily to my Fitbit and is very easy to put on and takeoff. The one note I have is that the band is gray with just a light pink border. The picture makes it look like the band was going to be pink. I still like it though!
4.0,Super cute! Only issue is 3-4T is actually the size of a very tall 4 year old so we are going to pin it up because it’s too long
4.0,"these shorts do alleviate that saddle pain, I can ride longer and I am much more comfortable in the saddle.  No longer feel like I am extracting the seat when I get off my bike.  However, I should have gotten a large as the x-large is more like a 1X.  I can actually pull the waistband up to my bra line and the body and legs fit but have no compression, they are not as tight as I wanted.  The legs do not roll up and do not have the sticky rubber stuff on the edges that other types have.  Breathable and keeps me dry, which makes for a lovely comfortable ride.  I would buy again, but in a smaller size."
4.0,"Pretty and delicate.  I do wish the chain were a little heavier weight.  The clasp is really tiny, too.<br />Over all a nice necklace."
4.0,"I like this dress. I'm 5ft2 in and a muscular 135 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits nicely and the length is just right, but any shorter would be too short for a teacher like myself. It fits a little tailored and is slightly see through,but it is also a white dress which is to be expected a bit. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,Very nice watch i like it but there's No  instruction manual
4.0,I like it but the small size that I had ordered was a bit too big for me.  I gave it to my sister and it fits her (and she's medium).
4.0,It seemed to be a good shirt but it runs at least 1 or 2 sizes smaller
4.0,"Love it! I bought the black and white version. Love that it is versatile, you can wear it off one shoulder or regularly. I tried it off one shoulder and it stays in place without having to be readjusted."
4.0,Quite a bit longer than expected!
4.0,"A soft, lightweight, keyword being lightweight, silicone watchband.  Good for inexpensive watches. Would have preferred a black buckle over a chrome one. Came with spring bars and tool.  Certainly not going to find anything better for $8."
4.0,"This is a cute luggage set.  If using for airplane travel and you plan on checking the bag... I would suggest purchasing a suitcase cover to keep it clean and protected.<br />Only Cons I found:<br />~The handle extender seems a little weak and like it may break.<br />~no side handle to pick it up, which would make it easier to get into the car, and on and off luggage racks and airport tables."
4.0,ok not fancy but casual. The Polka Dots are navy blue and they show more than in the picture.
4.0,"i'm 5'4 about 115 lbs. and the medium was too small, especially the inseam. definitely recommend sizing up. material seems nice."
4.0,"Not the best quality pair I've ever had, but still solid.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Wrap around lens<br />- Light weight, but well made<br />- Polarized<br />- Nice functional style<br />- Stays in place<br />- Comfortable<br /><br />Concerns:<br />- Plastic lenses - cleaning plastic lenses, and possible scratches (My phobias)<br /><br />Overall, solid pair of sunglasses."
4.0,"Love the quality, nice knit material & the shoulder ties are really cute. If you want it to fit anything like the model in the photo though,  size up one or two. It's very fitted. I'm 5'10"" usually a size xs/s, and the size small was fitted on me not loose like the photo. Will be ordering a bigger size."
4.0,"I'm a person who gets easily overwhelmed when wearing a mask and this one doesn't make me want to hyperventilate. It's worth the purchase if you're a short person like me otherwise if you're taller with a bigger face I'd go with something else. Just like the other reviewer mentioned about the buttons, it can easily come off if you fidget around a lot. If you're not going to be removing your mask often then the strap is okay. For me I need to take it off and on so it makes it difficult to utilize quickly. You need to remember what buttons do what because I thought I was pushing the on button and I kept thinking it was not charged. Unfortunately it was the light button. One of the buttons actually is for the light on the bottom of the mask. I'm not sure why someone would want a light unless it's just to be cool, LOL! But whatever. It does make a seal around my nose and mouth. Which serves its purpose. Although the noise is sometimes too much for me, at least it lets me know it's working. I would rather hear the noise knowing it's on, then guessing if it's even working. I wish it came in different colors so that my kids would be attracted to using it. And the fact that I like to wear makeup, I don't see this being an item I can easily rub the color of my makeup off of. It comes with a nice little bag to store it in. I use it just store it in my purse in case I want to use a traditional mask. I think children would find it more comfortable to use than an adult. Actually using it on a child would prove more bearable for them to use a masks because of its continuous air it provides. I have yet to use it for an entire day so I can't say anything about its longevity of battery life. The shape is kind of weird from afar. I didn't get any weird looks from people. It's just embarrassing in very quiet environments because you can really hear the fan running. Overall who cares if it helps you breathe better. It comes with two filters that are specific to the mask, I do see refillable filters that you can purchase separately. It's meant to use for about a week unless it gets dirtier from constant usage. The refillable filters seem to cost a fair amount that's worth its purchase. I use this mask in addition to my regular mask. Although I don't use them at the same time. You can charge it in your car with a traditional USB charging wire."
4.0,"The frame is very close in quality to the prescription glasses I have.  The lenses aren't perfect, but for the price they are a great deal.  I would buy again, and probably will in different colors."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful with vibrant colors. I wear a size 18W postpartum and it's a comfortable dress. It is very tight in the chest but most things are (44 DDD bra size), but the material has enough stretch to stretch it out and make it work. I would say it's more accurately a size 16."
4.0,I read some people say some didn’t work but they all worked fine for us. I got them for valentines class hand outs. Kids had a blast. The blinking light is concerning tho since it’s right by their eyes almost blinding. But they all loved them.
4.0,"Very quick receiving of the wallet after ordering. The wallet is everything I was expecting. Card slider works well and the wallet holds lots of cards without issue. The only surprise is that the wallet is rather thick in your pocket. However, because of its small side to side diameter, it slides out of the way when sitting nicely. I have no problems with it in my back pocket. Very happy with this purchase."
4.0,Cute suit but too small at the top.
4.0,I tried on a pair and I am very pleased with my purchase.  The stockings fit as expected and they look great with my black dress pants.
4.0,"Cute, comfortable top, but it’s not a tunic. Wider than it is short. Needs to be at least 2 inches longer!"
4.0,I had been looking for a lightweight dress I could wear with my kids at the park and also around town doing errands and going out on a date. This is is a great dress for all three. Its $20 so I wan't expecting too much. The colors are clear and vibrant. I would probably wear a slip underneath though. Its not a think dress and the material isn't cotton. Its has a night pull to it and I flares out a little--like a swing dress would but not quite as much.<br /><br />I am a size 6 and ordered a large<br />5'4&#34;<br />138lbs<br />34C
4.0,"I'd say these pants are very much worth the price. They're not amazing by any means but mine came in and fit fairly well, and are defiantly worth the lower price tag. They are't see-through in the slightest, which is what I was primarily worried about. Overall good quality pants!"
4.0,"It is very large, perhaps it's the style. By looking at the picture, I thought the dress is made of real denim but it is actually not.<br />It's very comfortable but pricy!"
4.0,"La cartera es linda y conserva la forma, es de tamaño pequeño hermoso pero las asas de mano me parecen muy delicadas.."
4.0,I like the style and comfortable fit. The material is transparent so you need something underneath
4.0,"These leggings are cute and comfortable. I wear these to workout in. I got size XL because that's what I wear in leggings. These in XL are fairly big on me. They are baggy on my legs and around my waist, but they stay up. On another note, they keep you warm in case you're looking for leggings that breathe. I personally prefer these kind of leggings to workout in. I recommend these leggings."
4.0,"She likes the color and the design, but the size is very disappointing. This is what the seller says on the page: &#34;<br />•Our clothing sizing has been updated<br />•Please select the correct size for your order and need not choose larger size&#34;<br />She wears US size 2 and the seller's top says S/US 6. She thought the top would be a little big bigger and fit her loosely and that was what she wanted. However, the top, which labels S, is smaller than US 0. She can put it on but it is tight.<br />We still give it four star for the seller's service and for the design and color."
4.0,Perfect earrings ! Love them...but  I never get the back plastic piece to tie but not big deal
4.0,The bag feels soft and has a lot of pockets. My only complaint is that the opening to get into the bag is a little small which makes it hard to find things since the bag is so deep.
4.0,"This shirt is cute, fits well (size as expected), not too clingy (thank you, Painted Heart!), well made with fabric that's not too thin, and the cutouts add interest without the risk of offending anyone's grandmother :)  I do have a quick suggestion to wear it with a strapless bra, or at least one where the straps won't compete with the neckline (my black bra with thick straps didn't look bad, just a bit distracting in the cutout area). But overall it's a great shirt."
4.0,I like my sweatshirts larger than my normal size for comfort. This sweatshirt was priced right and it keeps me warm.
4.0,They arrived really early . But some of the pictures were. Misleading like some of the earrings appeared  bigger in real life
4.0,"Cute shirt. It is pretty big on me, but still looks fine. I usually wear a woman's 4-6 (Small) and it probably fits more like and extra large. I think it still it a cute shirt though, nothing fancy."
4.0,"I'm torn on my rating for this. If I were rating only the first hat I ordered (plain dad hat Army Green), it would be a solid 5 stars. It fits well on my smaller-than-average head (which is sometimes tricky even with adjustable baseball caps), I like that the excess part of the adjustable band slides back into a channel in the hat so it's hidden, the hat is heavy enough to stay put but not so heavy that my head overheats in summer, the brim provides enough shade from sun that I don't miss my sunglasses if I'm not wearing them in addition, and the color/style are flattering. (Although the Army Green is almost more of a grey than an olive green.)<br /><br />So...I liked that first hat so well that after six weeks of regular wear and no complaints, I purchased a second of the same style in another color (Navy). It is smaller than the Army Green hat. The fit around my head feels the same when I have it pulled down as far as I can, but it's shorter so it doesn't stay on as firmly and thus tends to ride up, even with my hair in a low braid and pulled through the back opening. I still wear it but usually only if I'm in a hurry and can't find the first one. It's probably just going to be my back-up hat for the car. I wear these when I'm doing outside activities (hiking, etc.) when I may need to wear my face mask around other people and sunglasses would be inconvenient. Since I'm physically active when I'm wearing the hat, having a hat slide up my head and need periodic readjustment is sort of annoying.<br /><br />So in summary, I love the Army Green hat; it fits well in every way and I wear it frequently. The Navy hat, not so much. I'm frustrated at the inconsistent sizing because I liked the first hat so well."
4.0,"I have long arms, but this shirt doesn't.  I also have long legs and these pants so too! So I roll the sleeves a little and rock my outfit with pride."
4.0,"This is good enough for any choir concert.  Fits well enough and is easily adjustable.  I wouldn't necessarily get married in this, but far away on a stage, it's all good."
4.0,"These are lovely and silky scarves, great for tying to your purse and giving it some Christmas season flair. The colors are bright and vibrant, and they seem durable to last through many seasons. These Christmas scarves would work well as a headband also, so I do like their versatility.<br /><br />Each scarf has two different printed sides, so options are plentiful. You can technically have a different design displayed for each day of the week. The only issue that made me dock a star from my rating is the Christmas duck design, which shows in my pictures. I am not sure what a duck has to do with Christmas, let alone the print ""Doke Duck"" on the scarf. I believe these are made in China, so it would be a mistranslation, or the designers aren't as familiar with the American traditional Christmas designs. Still, these scarves are nice, and they are worth the 4 stars for quality, versatility, and overall design."
4.0,I like the shirt but. I thought it was vinyl print. The shirt is heat pressed. So after a few washes it will start to crack in the lettering.
4.0,It’s huge!!! Bought for my daughter and it is even big on me. Luckily she is content with it being part of her MHA anime corner in her room. Wish this info was easier to identify...update there was a fitting issue that was way to navigate and the mask looks markedly better. Adjusted the strap to a fit on top of her head and shortened the strap. Now she is Himoko Toga or Bane. Happy Halloween all!!
4.0,Really weird sewing lines. Instead of going down your sign it crosses across where your hips/hip bones would be. Took some getting used to but overall not terrible for the price
4.0,"compass is decoration only, needle doesn't move,  other than that it's a beautiful piece"
4.0,"It fits great for a 10 year old.  However, the padding could be a bit thicker.  Overall, a good purchase..."
4.0,"The material actually of surprising quality (in a good way) and color was very pure white. I was not expecting it to be THIS short (just below the butt cheek) . I am 5’0” 115lb for reference. If short is what you want and you think this dress is cute, don’t hesitate to buy!"
4.0,very nice key chain. Our granddaughter loved it.
4.0,The earrings are beautiful and have not caused any reactions. The confusion is the description says titanium but when I got them the packaging says stainless steal.
4.0,Nice robe.
4.0,I like this dress but it was too fitted. I normally wear a size 16 so I ordered an xl. This dress fits my body and all my curves.
4.0,This watch is overboard lovely!  Easy to read for my aging eyes and extremely expensive looking.  I would have kept it and gave it a full 5 stars but it is an overseas Seiko product so Seiko USA does not carry the links for lengthening the band.
4.0,"Unfortunately if you sweat or the beads get wet in any way, the color bleeds"
4.0,I was very excited to get this piece for such a fantastic price!  The only bummer for me is that the beads are more orange then red (I thought they were red).  But it is beautiful and I will wear it.
4.0,The design is good but the inside forehead lining is towel like material which is uncomfortable
4.0,"Fit well, Stylish. There’s a nice pocket sewn inside for the placement of a filter ( filter not included)."
4.0,"This is a great band for my Fit2. I took a star off, because the tool to take out links doesn't always work correctly. It took me over an hour to take out 5 links."
4.0,"I love this shirt. It fits comfortably loose as I wanted. I am a US 16 and ordered XXL and it fits great. People are complaining about the stitching being on the outside, but the photos show that. That is how it is supposed to come. I plan to buy more of these shirts."
4.0,Not enough elastic at legs. Otherwise it's great
4.0,"Perfect for professionals in the summer. They do snag and pill, but since they’re dark, it isn’t too noticeable. But they’re not expensive, so it’s a win for me."
4.0,"The band is great ! It’s one of the best I’ve used so far but the only thing that bothers me about this watch band is the hard plastic. I wish it had a little more rubber the plastic feels cheap but the concept l, the design everything else about the watch is absolutely fantastic! I would definitely recommend it"
4.0,Very nice single strand pearl necklace. Bracelet and earrings were nice too. Good to wear for dress up or everyday wear.
4.0,"Cumple su función, es fresco, lo use en el desierto y fue una grata experiencia. No le pongo 5 estrellas debido al envío. Lo enviaron de una forma en la que en vez de sombrero parecía acordeón, tuve que ponerlo debajo del colchón una semana antes de mi viaje porque cuando llego a mis manos no tenía forma."
4.0,"I ordered an XL in this (I'm normally a large in women's sizes), because the sizing chart said that's what I would fit.  I'm big chested (38 DDD), and in the bust area underneath the armpits, was sagging out pretty bad.  Since I am a bigger chested woman, the cinch line doesn't hit me at my waist.  It hits me underneath my bust line.  It's still a SUPER cute dress (I got it in Multicolour) - the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered based off the sizing chart, so I had to start a return, and purchase a large.  Also, I am 6'1 and the dress hits just right above my knees, so if you're shorter, it will hit past your knees or right at your knees:). I would definitely size down!"
4.0,They worked well and are holding up - which was a problem with a previous order of similar product/different vendor.
4.0,Thanks fits good..
4.0,exactly what I ordered
4.0,Like the glasses just a little bigger than I thought.  The round portion of the glass seems huge.
4.0,"The material is a little thinner, and maybe a little shorter than I was expecting - however, I'm enjoying them with each wearing. I wash on cold and hang dry. When I shop &#34;higher end&#34; clothing - I'm always a perfect Medium/8-10...I felt I took a risk ordering a Medium from a &#34;made in China&#34; product - as their mediums usually fit like an extra small, however, this particular shirt fits as expected. I bought it in both black and gray. These are my new &#34;go-to&#34; tops for the weekend...I feel dressed up in a t-shirt! I can recommend this shirt."
4.0,I bought this purse for my mother she always has a ton of stuff in her purse and this purse was perfect for her it has tons of space and pockets it's made with great quality
4.0,They hold your shirt in place...that's it
4.0,like we expect
4.0,"I thought these were polarized, but they are not. i may have read the description wrong. they worked fine for backpacking and seakayaking."
4.0,Super cute top however if you are busty then order up a size. Looks really cute with leggings. I gave it to my daughter and ill be ordering a size up.
4.0,"When you tie this shirt at the bottom it still leaves a hole in the shirt. Also won’t stay down on my shoulders, continuously riding up."
4.0,"This suit is my new fav! It gives a nice push up and just the right amount of cleavage without looking inappropriate.  It’s comfy and sexy. But not too sexy so I can wear it to my local swim club. The bottoms, on the other hand, were too big but I was able to wear another black bottom that I already had.  I ordered a size large- the top was a good fit; the bottoms too big.  Overall, love the suit for the great price!!"
4.0,"These are coool! Each pair comes with a good range of sizes so they should work well for most people and most shoes. The largest one was a bit too large for my feet, so didn't hold any tension, but because there are more thingies than places for them fit on my shoe, I just rearranged them until I found the sizes that work best. They did not come with the &#34;free tool&#34; as advertised but this would be unnecessary anyway as they're easy to put in.  I ran errands in them all day and they stayed put, and my feet were comfortable. They make it super easy to slide shoes on and off without having to readjust or worry about laces coming untied. Overall, very happy with this purchase!"
4.0,I love the bathing suit just fit a little more snug on my daughter than I'd like.
4.0,I ordered this wallet for my husband. It is a slick leather but appears to be made well. A better review can be given after using it for awhile.
4.0,"I like these well enough. They're comfortable and easy to wear.  I was expecting to wear them regularly like a typical leather surfer bracelet but since most of the strands are just dyed rope they started to bleed and fade after being worn in the shower a few times. I still wear them, they just look like I've owned/worn them forever even though I've only had them for about a month."
4.0,"I absolutely love them!  They're bigger than I thought they would be, but they're pretty and went beautifully with the dress I had."
4.0,Happy with this to support my husband. Wore it at his fundraiser. The fit was a little tighter than I hoped for but overall happy.
4.0,"The leggings are a thick material, which is nice.  The skirt is VERY fitted/form-fiting and is the length depicted in the picture."
4.0,On the smaller side.
4.0,"This is my husband's review: This is a good watch, I wanted something different and masculine but not over the top. To really get the full effect I changed the strap to a black heavy canvas one and it gave the watch a better look. I like the simplicity of design and it's easy to read even in low level light situations. The color combinations of the hands and numerals give it a unique look. Size is medium and it doesn't scream for attention like some watches, but to those who notice what kind of watch you are wearing it sets a subdued tone."
4.0,Loved this outfit! I’m 161 5’2” and I got a Medium
4.0,"I love this headband, it’s so cute and goes with so many things. My only wish was that it was adjustable because by the end of the day it starts feeling very tight."
4.0,Nice looking! For organization inside. Just has a strong fake leather smell upon first opening it. It does diminish with time.
4.0,Very cute but runs large
4.0,I really like the bag. the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the smell. It may be from the ink so I hope it fades.
4.0,The seams aren't the most comfortable. Most noticable on long walks. Length is good. Waist fits ok.
4.0,The earrings came pretty quick..Good quality and looked great on my son!
4.0,Great quality shoe! A tad big but they will last the school year
4.0,I liked the style & fabric but had tp return it because it was bigger than expected. Cute dress though...
4.0,"I really like these, but they are pretty cheap in terms of quality. I had to get one replaced from PEET (which they were nice about) and when that one broke I had to repair it myself.<br /><br />It would be 5 stars if the quality of the materials was better. You'll get about half a year of use out of these before something fails. Which is a shame because they do a super job at drying out and deodorizing shoes! If you do a lot of jogging or running I can't recommend this product enough. It absolutely works, and it works well -- for a while.<br /><br />When my current one eventually breaks again I'll be first in line to buy the Ultra Dryer again. PEET will get my money but they need to step up the craftsmanship!"
4.0,This is the second one I ordered. First was Red color and was bigger in size and length than this blue one. I like both but Red is my favorite.
4.0,"These tanks came on time, are good quality (not see through) and are a great value. They are comfortably soft, the perfect length and move with your movements. Fit as expected."
4.0,"I really like them, but I have a high instep and sometimes my feet go a little numb.  I think they may be starting to stretch a little."
4.0,"Durable, but a little small"
4.0,"I like these, but they do run small in the rise. The waist was fine, the legs are wide and flattering, but the rise wasn't quite right. Sizing up 1 to 2 sizes would be perfect."
4.0,"I bought this for a prank on my girl friend as it kind of looks like a &#34;Corn Snake&#34;. She had one in her Den and it freaked her out and her two little dogs. She had to have someone come and remove it. So, I sent it to her via UPS and she shreaked upon opening it. I put a little piece of corn next to the snake to remind her what it is! Well, I am in the doghouse now with that trick! It back fired on me! But, I'll give it time and she will come around again! I am sure she will get back at me again!"
4.0,"Everything was good expect that when I open it, it had a scratch across the card slot."
4.0,I do jot know what this picture is but it was a nice bead
4.0,"Lovely blouse, but too large"
4.0,"This is exactly as the photo states and matches the description. The magnets hold well so overall I am happy with it.<br /><br />My daughter said, Dad you're wearing a rubber necklace. True, but I like it"
4.0,Fit is Great for me. Washes and drys without any issues. Nice bright color.
4.0,These are cute sunglasses. They arrived in good condition with all of the rhinestones in tact.  They are as pictured.  I would have given them 5 stars but they are a little stiff when opening almost afraid they will break. They don't sit quite right but that could be me. Maybe they aren't made for my round shape face.  I could wear them for a while but definitely not all day if I was out in the sun because they are not the most comfortable glasses but then that could be me.
4.0,Got these in taupe and also in red. The red is stunning.
4.0,These were nice but ran large. I am a size 10 and got a large.
4.0,"Got these in a medium and I'm 150 lbs and 5'7. The fit is great, definitely tighter than looser but that's what I was looking for. Only down side is that they feel a little hotter than what I would like, especially for workout and hot weather. They make you sweat a lot but the fabric dries pretty fast."
4.0,"They are very nice for the money but they seem to run one size smaller. I wear a size 9.5 and ordered large, but its a pretty tight fit. Other than that i like them."
4.0,I wear a medium in US size but ordered an XL in this. It's still a touch small.
4.0,"I am 5'9, 175 curvy female and the romper fits great. This is perfect for tall women. I put on heels and the length of the pant leg was barely off the floor. Only flaw is that I cant button the romper... but that is because I have large breast. (38DD). but that's nothing that a tank top cant fix."
4.0,Great top for spring and early fall
4.0,"I have a not so traditional shape (not an hourglass), so I could have gone down a size. I went according to bust size, but I have small rib cage, with a straight figure."
4.0,"Sure cute coat. It’s not as warm as I would have hoped, but it’s still very nice. I think I should have sized up if I wanted the true oversized fit. Overall happy with this purchase."
4.0,This is a pretty little bracelet its not as wide as it looks in the picture but I'm happy with it.
4.0,"There was one sock that had some dirty mark.  Its well knitted and comfortable, yet very warm.  No complaints here."
4.0,My feet are always cold when sleeping so seem to do as advertised but I needed a second outer sock to really work. Still satisfied but will like to see how well they last
4.0,All very nicely made and worth the price.
4.0,"this was a good deal, made the bracelets about half price as our local store. i didn't get to pick the colors but otherwise i was happy with it"
4.0,I love the size and fabric. But....I realized there were holes inside the front pockets when I was looking for my keys. Since I still like the bag I’m going to use my purse organizer to keep everything in place. Amazon has many of them to choose from especially the ones that have a zipper on top. Hope this helps.
4.0,De buena calidad ...
4.0,"This is a cute wrap for summer. It's very light weight, and almost completely sheer. I have several heavier boho kimino cardigans, but I live in Arizona and for the hot months I just want something that can keep the sun off my skin a bit without actually adding any layers of hot extra clothing. It's also a good bridge piece for crop tops since it covers you up a bit but lets a bit of skin show through.<br /><br />This was sold as a one size fits all, and although I'm sure that's not exactly true, it is cut very loosely and would probably be comfortable on most average sized women. I'm 5'4&#34; 120lbs and usually wear a size 4 US. The top could probably be belted into a very short dress length on me, hitting at about mid thigh (although again, it's sheer). The print is a light gray on turquoise and is a slightly cute, slightly cliche southwestern cow skull, feather motif that I can never decide if I find charming or irritating when it comes to boho fashion, but it's subtle at least and the colors are great so I'm just going to embrace my own kitchiness I guess.<br /><br />I'm posting the picture of the back, since when I got it I had no idea the cow skull was there and figure some other people might share my tendency towards finding it cheesy. Still, compared to the &#34;Aztec&#34; and &#34;Navajo&#34; are not those things at all (I live in Navajo country and fake Navajo designs are especially bleh) this one is pretty benign. Just, you know, maybe a bit more faux west then I was intending.<br /><br />Tastes vary! Also, like everything listed as chiffon on here, it's polyester, although I'm glad for that, because who would want an easily wrinkled up possible swimsuit coverup to be made out of chiffon the most hard to care for fabric ever?<br /><br />I got this kimono top at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, and I'm sorry for the dissertation on tacky designs in the middle. At least it's honest."
4.0,The mask did not fit me quite well enough to prevent leaks. It seemed a little small for an adult or it didn't quite adapt to the shape of my face. It works well enough for my purposes as I don't plan on using it for an extended period of time under water. The mask itself seemed to have some viewing distortion in the very center.
4.0,Great dress a little tight but made from good material and is not thin.
4.0,"I've had this watch for quite awhile now.  It looks good and keeps time accurately.  It is easy to adjust the size and stays in place.  I have whacked it a few times while working in the yard with it on and it has not failed as a result.  So pretty much all good.  The rating is four stars because a few times the latch has let go and the watch has fallen off.  I finally made a minor adjustment and its better now, but that is really a bit of a design flaw."
4.0,Stones were clear and bright; wish they were a tad bigger.
4.0,Very comfortable for sleeping in.<br />Legs are short so no walking the dog with them or you look a little dated.
4.0,"I really like the color and shape, for some this product may be too small but it fits well on me; however the metal is cheap and will bend lots"
4.0,"extremely comfortable to wear, however the white one gets pretty grimy underneath.  it really catches the dirt and oil on your skin.  you'll have to clean it very frequently"
4.0,"Nice quality medium weight sweatshirt, but runs way small."
4.0,"Great dress but fits a little loose. I am 5'0, 130 lbs, 34-29-37 and ordered a medium. Stretchy material. Length is to my knees."
4.0,"This watch looks really nice - elegant and good quality.  I bought it as a gift for my Mom who is petite and older, so needs big numbers.  This is perfect for her.  Set-up was as expected - a bit challenging.  The instructions that come with the watch aren't the best, so you may need to rely on customer reviews or find the website.  My Dad is a typical man, so spent entirely too much time trying to figure it out himself before he even looked at the instructions.  He finally got online (not sure what he looked at) and got it all set.  As for the voice - it is a bit scary and a bit gravelly - not super clear.  It may take some getting used to.  I wish it was a female voice.  Oh, well.  But it is definitely loud enough and eventually will prove its worth since my mother is beginning to slip mentally and is constantly asking us what time it is."
4.0,Nice slippers.  I've washed them several times in the machine and they hold up well.
4.0,"Good made, and the material feels like from a swimsuit, so I think you can use it like a crop top,at the gym or at the pool.<br />Definitely you need to choose a size up, will be right for your chest but loose for your waist.<br />I was expecting something better for the price."
4.0,"Great suit, good quality, but too small for my fiance. He is a broad shouldered man though"
4.0,"This dress is very cute and I honestly thought this was going to be the dress I went with for an event; however after putting it on, I found that it was not that flattering on me.  I am 5'2"" and 130lbs....it fit perfectly (I went by the size chart of the company) but I just feel it would be more flattering on someone who is a bit taller.  The skirt of the dress definitely has some volume to it and the waist is just not defined enough for someone my height.  It is very cute though and would definitely recommend, but maybe to someone who has longer legs!"
4.0,The lanyard lock can come off. But outside of that its great!!
4.0,Muy lindo abrigo  Un poco grande pero bello
4.0,love the hd look. good price
4.0,I liked the fob but the ring was small
4.0,"Good cap, just a bit awkward to get your hair in"
4.0,"Love the color combination.  Love the texture. The one con I can think of is the material is thick and makes it so that I need more tie length for it to properly work. This leads to the thinner back part of the tie to be too short.<br /><br />If it was a longer tie, it would be perfect."
4.0,I have a couple of these blouses and love them.
4.0,It was a little big but after I washed it it shrunk. You have to tie the headband yourself so I just made it into a bow.
4.0,"This wasn’t what i wanted, but I mistakenly took the tag off. I didn’t realize it was a Lycra/clingy type of material. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
4.0,Product looks exactly as pictured and great value for price. They are adorable!  I love the bigger loops to get them on my little guy easier. We are overall very pleased. I rated 4 stars becauSe I don’t know yet how they will fair overtime.  I’ve seen Some rain boots crack after a few months and am interested to see how these will last.
4.0,"has a bit of a smell, still present, but not as strong after wiping and airing.<br />looks nice!<br />not adjustable. it was a bit loose for me, but I made it work."
4.0,Smaller than I expected but cute and colorful. They match with many outfits.
4.0,I love this swimsuit! And my daughter loves her matching one. Mine has full coverage exactly where I need it! Wound definitely recommend this suit.
4.0,"Would not recommend for children as it will break if forces apart. I got mine for a cosplay costume, will probably be adding fingernail polish to look like beads. I love it and it fit my size 8 wrist with no pinchinhg or looking deform when I put it on"
4.0,"Cute shirt, good quality, but too small. Have to return."
4.0,I got a few little things like this but it's exactly what you expect which is always nice
4.0,"Soft and perfect for warmer weather. Light fabric. Great price point,too."
4.0,They were a bit more baggy than I preferred at the ankle and the button is loose. I'll have to replace it soon. Other than that I loved them.
4.0,This was exactly what I was expecting!!  Glad the option exists to remove the dark protective glass leaving clear glass to see through. Thanks.
4.0,"Love,love,love the softness of these leggings, thought they were going to be to small when I took them out of the package, but they fit perfect. I'm 5'4 and 155 and the one size fit all was perfect. Color was true to picture, and you cannot see thru them,  only wish waist band was wider. . Will be buying more for sure."
4.0,"I like the look and function of this clip. It took a few tries to get it to hold well, but overall very happy"
4.0,"Very nice watch for the price, and I like the pop of orange that it gives.  I did find out though that wrap watches aren't very comfortable for me."
4.0,"These were just as pictured and expected. A moderate size (not small or too big), better than descent quality, and an incredible price for what you would pay in most places. I like options when it comes to accessories and these were good basics that replaced some that either had scratches on lenses or showed signs of wear.<br /><br />My only comment is that I was disappointed only 2 of the 6 glasses were inside individual packaging and they were all just thrown in a padded envelope. I was surprised none had any noticeable scratches."
4.0,I would buy this again! It's so comfortable worn as a swimwear cover up.  I would order another in a differeent color!
4.0,Pockets are short and not big enough.
4.0,"This was a gift and it was exactly as described by seller, but the ring is too thick to use for car key fob. I’m not sure I would buy again."
4.0,"Great wallet, exactly as described. Its slot softer than I thought it would be, which is great, because I don't have to break it in."
4.0,"Great design and comfortable to wear, I do hope the inner pocket on the compression section have zipper, or potentially tighter given I already have a larger phone."
4.0,"Normally straight cut dresses don't work for my body type, small waist, hips and booty however I actually love this! I'm 135 5'7&#34;, 34b ordered the medium. I am crossing my fingers it doesn't shrink b/c it fits just right across my bum. The green is more of a heathered green and who doesn't love pockets!"
4.0,"Love the color (red), and it's definitely well-made. The hood is NOT detachable, despite what the product description says. Also, the coat runs large...though the sleeves aren't too long, which is a big plus for someone like me who, in spite of being average height (5'5"") with average-length arms to match, have a terrible time finding clothes with sleeves that don't cover my fingers!"
4.0,"While the color was slightly off from what I expected, Love this top and receive compliments every time I wear it! I am planning on ordering in another color."
4.0,"They are adorable, though noticeably cheap (faux wooden heel is plastic and makes a hollow clicking sound when you walk). They're a little uncomfortable as there is not platform under the balls of your feet and the heel is so steep. Also the heel straps are really wonky and stretch out really fast. But beauty is pain and the shoes are cute none the less."
4.0,You will need to be easy on them.
4.0,I just might have to buy a few more colors! I replaced the original bands on my Versa 2 with these. They are super comfortable and sporty looking. Easy to pop on the watch. Too early to know how well they survive in the wash machine.
4.0,"Overall I really like it. Despite it being a one piece, it's very sexy, low cut, suggestive. I docked it one star for a couple reasons: while the bust in this actually fit over my huge breasts for a change, it was a bit big in the waist and a bit long. I will need to have it shortened at the straps which are under the ruffle, meaning I will have to take it to my tailor, in order for it to be more supportive and fit properly. It has a tie in the back but I can't get it tight enough to account for the room in the waist and the shoulders, though with the tie in the back at the tightest, it's still manageable. I don't mind getting it altered because it's rare that I find something that fits my bust this well, plus my husband is in love with it and he only cares about seeing me in it and then ripping it off my body for something else, ha! I also only gave it four stars instead of five because of the ruffle... This may be nitpicking to some but I think it would have made the suit look more high-end: The underside of the ruffle is white. The pattern is not double-sided on the material. I think it should have either been double-sided or they should have had the underside one of the main colors in the suit to give it a more finished look. Like I said though, it's sexy and not something anyone viewing it on a woman is even going to notice though. My husband said he'll pay to get this one tailored for me."
4.0,"Love this keychain, although I only gave it 4 stars because some keys will not turn while on this chain. But I am proud to have it and have my keys on it!"
4.0,"So. Many. Things. In my backpack. Just floating around, banging into each other, leaving me searching through a pile of stuff whenever I need something.<br /><br />Not anymore! The Grid-It has brought order to my chaos.<br /><br />The straps are numerous lengths and widths, so there's the &#34;perfect spot&#34; for everything I carry somewhere on the grid. They're also woven with some grippy rubber-like material, so whatever you stick under a strap stays there.<br /><br />There's a loop at one end so it's easy to pull out of your bag, and it has a zippered pocket on the back for papers or what not.<br /><br />My only complaint: it's a bit heavy. Between the thick straps and whatever board is inside (which makes it very stiff), it weighs as much or more than the things I have strapped onto it.<br /><br />Worth it though, because it means I don't have to go digging for anything in the bottom of my bag!<br /><br />Not quite 5 stars, but I'd give it 4.5 if I could."
4.0,I like it it is soft and sexy.....
4.0,"It is a very cute dress, however it is not really like the picture shown. Is more slim fitting not as baggy as picture shows. It is also longer, goes just below my knees."
4.0,I ordered a size larger than I normally am and it fit good except the sleeves are a little short. I'm only 5'4 so I don't have super long arms. I plan to push the sleeves up simliar to the picture. Super soft though and still love it!
4.0,"Got this dress going on 4 weeks now and wear it twice, at home, since purchased. Here are the good, the bad, and the verdict.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />- Decent price for the value<br />- True to color. I got the color burgundy and it is very pretty<br />- Super comfortable if you want to just lounge around<br /><br />THE BAD<br />- Buy down one size from your normal size as it comes in bigger than expected.<br />- not the most flattering dress. It meant to just for comfort. I am 5 ft, pettite, and this dress makes me look... big in a small size 😂<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br />Will not re-purchased."
4.0,Nice Dress.  Good quality fabric and perfect fit.
4.0,Great T Shirt. Fits as expected. I bit pricey though.
4.0,"Great quality.  The fabric is thick, so you can't see through them.  Very comfortable!"
4.0,Cute but weird starchy material.
4.0,Shipped really quickly. They are a little difficult to open and close when fresh out of the box but goes away over time.
4.0,The pockets on the inside were uncomfortable. Had to wear an undershirt
4.0,I love this top. I didn’t expect it to fit since my breast are so large (38f) but it fit as well as can me expected. I bought at xl
4.0,The material was great not too thin or thick and I like the silhouette of the dress. Definitely a cute cocktail dress. I am 38-29-41 and this dress fit great around my hips but slightly too big in the chest area. I wish it was just a little more form fitting up top. The highest point didn't have any wiring or anything to help keep it's pointed shape so it appeared wavy at times. But these were just small issues. Overall I would definitely recommend this dress.
4.0,"I know that all brands are different, but I was a little disappointed that my 12 year old is almost too big for this. For reference, he usually wears a large. We bought an XL and he'll probably fit it for the next few months only. It is well made and he is super happy with it, so that's really all that matters."
4.0,Tan about a size to two smaller. It’s a snug fit for sure but super pretty colors
4.0,Many compliments. I am 137 lb and 5' 7 1/2&#34; tall. I ordered an XL and fit like a M/L.
4.0,Show your team spirit!
4.0,Cute shirt got a small. Ties around in the back like this. Wish I had a picture of the front because it also looks cute
4.0,"Perfectly fine, color just wasn’t as lime as I was hoping."
4.0,"Color was as described and good quality well worth the price, the shipment was on time and I would give a good review to this company"
4.0,"I purchased the silver and rose gold pair. The designs were simply adorable. They sit really well on my ear and are easily adjustable. The rose gold was a lot pinker than I expected it to be, but overall a good investment for accessories."
4.0,LOVE the snaps.....don't love the chain as much.
4.0,"A lot thinner than I expected. Quality is much like a thicker sweatshirt. Living in Florida, I don’t mind. The color is not as vibrant as the picture but I still like it."
4.0,I am quite happy with purchase.  Delivery time faster than expected<br />Would absolutely purchase from company again.
4.0,Good quality mask was a little nervous that it wasn't going to fit my head ( due to that I have a big head lol ) but was pleased that it fitted as expected. Material feels good and the design on the mask feels like it's gonna last awhile. Very pleased with this buy :)
4.0,"Lovely cut &amp; good cotton material, but cut a little small for the size listed."
4.0,"The product is great. Warm, comfy, and soles are hard enough that I've worn outside with no damage / comfort issues. Only 4 stars because they ship it to you in a bag that's gonna get abused before you get it. They bounced back after some forming tho."
4.0,runs a little big
4.0,"The dress and quality is outstanding, it is still a bit tight from the chest but you can wear an spaghetti tank underneath.<br />I definitely recommend this item."
4.0,"I ordered these for me and my friend and the little card that the bracelets come with say for friends, mom, etc but when I got them the black one is very obviously meant for a guy as it was twice the size of the white one had to resize it myself. Otherwise they're very cute"
4.0,Super thin and comfy—could double as sleepware.  The large is enormous—not true-to-size.  Size down if you want a fit like the photo.
4.0,Young kids 5-7 works well but older ones need next size up
4.0,eye glasses fit perfect seems well made will see how they hold up
4.0,"Bought these for my kids as a solution to try and prevent my kids taking off their masks if they have to go back to school. Did a candle test and these are too thin to be on their own. Going to sew a cotton, two layer mask to the inside. When tested with a candle, the flame never moved. These are stretchy and soft. Some were more snug than others and the holes for ears weren’t all the same. Overall, for the price, they’re usable."
4.0,It was exactly as advertised with the bonus of the extra bands
4.0,"I love them they were the same process as the actual jibbtz. Only thing I didn’t like is some characters are missing, the same missing characters are the reason why I brought the charms in the first place. Just be prepared for not having all the characters described, but the price is amazing, for this price you can only get 2 piece of jibbtz or a five pack so you definitely get more charms than if you were to go on crocs ."
4.0,"Nice style, but a little narrow."
4.0,"I like the cute flying cat mask. I gave it a 4 rating because I had to take the time to respond to an incorrect order I received, and I was frustrated. It took extra time to deal with it and I was very busy with other things.<br />You did send a new one out immediately. That was very fast. I have returned the mistake today. Thank you. And because of this promptness, I would order from you again."
4.0,i like these sun glass i have trouble with my eyes and these glass block out a lot of the sun light
4.0,"nice shoe.. High style, but keep in mind if you normally take a size 10, you will want to order this shoe in a 10 & 1/2, or in my case a whole size larger & go with an 11. they just run small. Nice looking shoes though."
4.0,These slippers are exactly what I expected.  And the price is very reasonable compared to other brands.
4.0,I bought this shirt for my daughter and she absolutely loves it very soft flowy material looks super cute with leggings
4.0,Bought these for my daughter's dance class. They are lightweight and easy to wear. I wouldn't expect a kid to be able to use these outside the house to play in.<br /><br />These can certainly be a &#34;slip on&#34; shoe and they are true to size.
4.0,"Nice watch.  Looks good,  have had several comments confirming.  Fit is  good. Price was right.  Originally ordered the black but returned it for this one to get the illumination.  However the illumination is very weak by morning but seeable.  Dove to 100 ft with no problems.  Seller was great with no questions asked exchange."
4.0,"I was a little worried about buying this after reading the reviews. I ordered this for a wedding and got lots of compliments. It’s a beautiful dress and well made. It was a little bigger than expected, does expose the chest area but other than that so worth it!"
4.0,"Smaller than expected and came very tangled; it took me about 5 minutes to get the knots out. But, they are very pretty. Giving as a gift."
4.0,Purchased it for my vacation. I love it :-)
4.0,"It was okay, not what I imagined, kind of small."
4.0,I love the style. but I was thinking to wear in fall  but the material is  thin and cold.. I will wear as a cardigan not something keeps me warm
4.0,They were cute and looked exactly like the picture. Gave 4 stars because the blower things didnt make noise and I was under the assumption they would.  Besides that they were good.
4.0,"The Realwe bracelet is unisex, meaning it will work for a woman or man. The links appear to be braided (wheat chain) and has a traditional clasp. It is 18k white gold-plated and did not irritate my skin. I noticed no redness or rashes (hypoallergenic). Overall, this is a decent bracelet that anyone would like."
4.0,A little on the large size order down. The material is a little thick and does not drape nearly as nicely as the pictures.
4.0,Nice gift for our teenage daughter.
4.0,"Good quality, the color is more vibrant then in the picture though. I was expecting a more maroon and got a bright red"
4.0,Sizes seem comparable to that of other clothing sized like this.  I can tell already that the decals will probably last 3-4 washes before it starts to break down.  Might want to handwash if that is a concern for you.
4.0,"I bought these leggings for a friends circus themed wedding. It was a last minute purchase but they arrived quickly and once I put them on I liked them more than I thought I would! It was a great addition to my outfit, although I wish they were a little more visible under my dress! I will be trying to find a reason to wear these more often!"
4.0,"Great fit, nice material, bought 2 and 2 in white, mat fit aliitle big, but very happy"
4.0,"We happy on the whole with these bibs.  The only minor thing we think might be improved is the neck size, which is a one-size-fits-all apparently, but it is a bit large for us.  Would be nice if it were adjustable, but have no idea how difficult that might be to incorporate in this product."
4.0,"Reasonable price, does the job"
4.0,"These are very malleable and bent when they came in the mail. I wish they had come in some sort of box to protect them from shipping as they were only enclosed in a little envelope. Took me an hour with tweezers to fix them back into the shape. However, once I did, they looked stunning!"
4.0,"I really like these shirts. They are soft and surprisingly light weight. These worn with leggings or slim jeans..great! I hope I can find these in other colors....and made in the USA. I wear a large, ordered a large...true to size"
4.0,"These tights are nicely made and my daughter had no trouble with the opening on the foot.  The only down sides are that they seem to run a little small (more towards the size 7 and not the size 10), and that they do snag more easily than I would like.  They aren't Bloch's but for the price they are good and make sense for regular classroom use."
4.0,"I love these so much and I wear them around all the time! They look great, however, they aren't very durable at all. Within a couple weeks I had some rips on the seam that went down the arm. Nothing a needle and thread can't fix, but they aren't the toughest accessories I've used."
4.0,"Love these, will get more uses out if them!"
4.0,"I love these boots.  I have people say don't take them off or they may go missing.  I am still breaking them in.  My one foot is a 1/2 size bigger than the other.  That is my only complaint.  They just pop.  I was outside by the lights of the restaurant and my friend said those boots are gorgeous.  I wear a 7 1/2 usually and got a  6 1/2 in these.  I might have gone up to a 7, just because of the 1/2 size difference in the other foot."
4.0,Beautiful shoe. My feet are a bit wide so I had to return. They were too tight.
4.0,Good quality. Does run big as others have noted so mine fits just as others expected
4.0,Good quality ball
4.0,This fits well although after a month the color is coming off in a few areas. To be fair I am rough on watches and bands though. This is comfortable and the magnetic catch keeps this securely on my wrist...
4.0,The dress is very cute<br />However the lace has a lining underneath wich makes it a little bit hot so am waiting for cooler days to wear it.<br />Also when washing n drying the lace started pebbling so hang dry after gentle cycle
4.0,It is a warm Jacket but as I wear a xl I thought a  xxL would be perfect . It's pretty snug. I can wear it ok zips up ok but this is not a lose fitted Jacket for sure. I am guessing either the sizing is slightly too small or it's meant to be snug. I feel had I ordered in my right size I would of been unable to zip it up.
4.0,Great for the beach or a day by the pool.
4.0,"Took a star off because as another reviewer stated, these are denim colored instead of true denim.  Otherwise, I really like them.  I am 5'3 and 145 pounds and I got a medium and they fit great.  I was worried that they would be too long but actually they are short enough I can wear flats.  In fact, I think they would look better with heels if they were longer.  One concern is the zipper does not ""lock"" and I worry it could come unzipped but since the pants are not tight that has not happen to me so far."
4.0,Given as a gift. The person said it was very nice
4.0,"These are pretty darn cute! Others said they seemed small, but they didnt really seem that way compared to the others I ordered!"
4.0,Love the colors but it looked a little bright in person overall it is a cute dress.
4.0,I am a size 10 and medium fit great! Soft comfortable shirt!
4.0,"Got this for a stocking stuffer for my daughter, and she loved it. Only drawback (4 rather than 5 stars) is the point at which the charm attaches to the chain seems very flimsy, and she's worried about it breaking."
4.0,They are very light. They have very good colors. You won't notice by far that they arent of superior quality. So for the price that's exactly what you get; 2 dollars and some cents for a tie. That's what I would pay for this really. I wouldn't say it's a bargain. But just a good buy. 👍
4.0,"This bag is big, too big for me.  but my daughter in law is thrilled.  It really is well made."
4.0,Si bueno no cómo yo esperaba pero me fueron util
4.0,"I love the style and cut of the dress. Its extremely flattering and makes me feel as if I am heading to a 1950s cookout. I love the fact that it has pockets even more. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fabric. It says it's made from 100% cotton, but it doesn't feel cotton-y to me. It's very slippery and has a bit of sheen to it. I'll still wear it and love it, just not on hot and humid days."
4.0,"Go a size bigger if you do not like tight-fitting hoodies. Other than that, it is great! Keeps you warm and images are spot on!!"
4.0,I genrally don't like jewels but i like this one becuse my my mother loved it so much and forced me to buy this and it is good deal
4.0,Nice style coat but not for larger figures.  This coat is for people with smaller waistlines.  I had to return it but I liked the craftsmanship and color in green.
4.0,Very large. Has a zipper top so I met the needs I had.
4.0,Just got this necklace and I'm quite pleased. The gems are beautiful. My only disappointment was it does not contain 108 beads like most Malas do. It contains 112 black beads. I guess this is more of a necklace/bracelet. It feels like it wasn't advertised correctly but it's still nice.
4.0,"I use these for daily driving and they work effectively, except from the side.  That's because of the thin wall design of the ear pieces which do take time to adjust by bending (tenderly)."
4.0,Sizing chart seems a bit off. But happy still.
4.0,"They are soft and sturdy. I got a large, they feel comfortable.  I got 2 pairs. I gave the other to my daughter. The gloves have ridges and I love that. No more dishes falling off."
4.0,Just what I was looking for overall. Low cut enough I can wear with a low cut top.  Small straps so I can wear eith tank top. Comfortable like a sports bra should be. The onky thing I didn't like was there was padding that had removable padding cups. I hate those. Not onky do they move around and make things look funny but I always loose them in the washing machine. If it's going to be padded they should be stiched into place .
4.0,"Holds my current personal IDs, cash & bank cards that have previously been stolen along with my purse."
4.0,"Wasn't aware of how short the bar was, earrings matched the description."
4.0,Worth the money. 4 completely different style midi ring sets. Perfect for a jewelry box to change style frequently. Already tarnished and bronze and turning green after one wear out though.
4.0,Nice glasses - I use them for road and MTB cycling.  They definitely do the job for a fraction of the cost of brand name glasses.
4.0,"Really cute boots. I wear an 8 and these were way too small, so size up at least a half size."
4.0,"Got this for my wife, and she likes it. Since it's plated, it shouldn't tarnish, and, it's a bit too big for her fingers - this one is a size 9, and even slides off her thumb, so we'll consider a resizing (if it's worth it). It's a nice looking ring, has a nice shine, and stands out in the light. A fun little 'Thanks for being a great wife' gift. Be sure to get her finger size before ordering. The one negative she's found (why 4 and not 5 stars), is because the wrap of these mountings interfere with finger movement (meaning the mounts wrap around too far, rubbing the fingers on either side)."
4.0,I  liked it a lot.  I wear on my wrist
4.0,I love these earrings. They’re dope! Only downside for me is how weak the posts are.
4.0,"It's a great product, and I use it often. Hard to beat at this price. My only grip is that the material is a little iffy. I would not wear this on just skin. If you have a large phone, it's gunna be a little difficult to hold in this. Wallet, keys and everything else will be fine."
4.0,"Very nice and high-quality bra for a very good price. I wouldn't mind just a bit less padding, personally, but the seller does include photos of the inside of the cups (thank you!!), so you know what you're getting."
4.0,👌！
4.0,"I like it, but it was a little too short, I purchased the size 7T for my 6 yrs old who is about 47 inches tall. The jumper stopped  above her ankle."
4.0,This  was way too thick for my liking.
4.0,Soft fabric and fit great.
4.0,"I purchased these to corral the gear inside my hiking and travel bags. They are useful for loose items- hats, gloves, reflective vests, the like. For the last several years I was always losing one glove or a hat somewhere in the bowels of my pack, but this way they are kept in one easily identifiable location. The size is perfect for a pair of gloves and a hat<br /><br />Unlike a zippered pouch, I can quickly un-cinch this, grab what I want, an re-cinch. It is lighter than most zippered pouches and can be made more compact if necessary. It is also great for keeping damp items, like socks, separate from the rest your gear without sealing it away, and you can always tie a mesh back to the outside to let it air out in the wind and the sun.<br /><br />The bright color contrasts with the inside of the hiking pack, and incidentally can be useful as an impromptu high-viz swatch if you are caught out on the road after dark.<br /><br />Seems reasonably durable, though definitely something I'd keep mostly in my pack than outside of it. This is more for clothes and lightweight items, not hard-edged tools or equipment. For example, the part of the bag around the drawstring isn't reinforced at all, so I imagine that, with regular use, you would see some fraying/degradation there. The material is relatively soft, not like those old mesh vests we used to wear in grade school.<br /><br />Would recommend for luggage of hiking."
4.0,Good but didn’t stay up well
4.0,"this product seems to be of good quality.<br />i dont like the fact that the poem has no punctuation whatsoever and is just not grammatically correct. i bought it for myself to hang from my rear view mirror so its not a huge problem, but definitely could be better."
4.0,Nice but pocket came off in first wash
4.0,"Dress is cute! Is me who does not have the body for! Is comfy fabric is soft, I will xpan and hope I could wear it"
4.0,It was a ok fit!!!
4.0,This was a gift. She loved it. I thought the symbol was too small.
4.0,"It was a bit smaller than expected, as well as one the lenses came cracked. Luckily, I'll be only using the non-cracked side anyway (I'll be cutting most of that side off) for a cosplay. Over all, the quality is good and it looks like it will with stand going to a couple conventions and wears!"
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and 170 lbs. I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly. It seems a little long but it should be an easy hem. Nice flexible material, very flattering design,"
4.0,"The fabric is super smooth and nice, tie dye color is just like it's shown. The fit, however, runs small. I'm 5' 7&#34; and about 185 lbs. I normally wear a 14/16. I got an XL and it's really snug. I'll need a larger size."
4.0,"I like these. I bought them to replace a different brand that showed up with one DOA sock. They last on low for an 8 hr work shift and so far are holding up well enough(5 mi a day). Walking 5 mi. a day in them I'm sure will wear on them but for the few weeks of ownership, no complaints."
4.0,Very pretty and delicate.  Bought as gifts so hope they wear well.
4.0,"I wear a size 9. I prefer sandals half size up, and these fit perfectly.  They're comfortable as I expect Campers to be.  They're exactly as pictured."
4.0,Super cute dress but definitely thinner than expected
4.0,"This is a pretty ring.  I actually got this for myself, when I saw I could get a discount for my review of it,  even though it is a man's ring.  I want to try it out and then maybe get my husband one.  It is a little wider than I like, but men's rings are!  These are durable, and I like that, as we are both hard on rings, & work outside a lot.  I like the looks of the stones.  They are set into the ring, so the top is smooth, it does not snag.  I am hoping the stones stay in place.  I am buying a few different rings of this type to find ones we both like.  I will update this review over time, as I see how it holds up.  So far the stone side of the ring stays at the top of my finger, as it should.  I am wearing it on  my 1st finger, so I'm not sure of the sizing, but it fits that finger fine, I wear a 7 on my ring finger. The sides could be a little more rounded, but this is the cut shown.  My husband likes it, so he would be happy with this type of ring.  I have had someone ask if it was white gold. The ring came in a nice little cloth bag. It is a nice ring for $13.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01EQUWNU4 Jstyle Jewelry 8MM Titanium Rings for Men Wedding Engagement Rings Promise Size 8]]"
4.0,Looks way more expensive than it is.
4.0,I purchased this watch for my father.  It works as advertised and easy to see and hear.
4.0,A little snug and thin but looks super cool.
4.0,"I really like it! I wish it was a tiny bit bigger, but I still like it. I'm 5' 8&#34; 145 pounds"
4.0,"I'm a big guy, kinda tight"
4.0,"This little cassette is adorable. It's about the size of a fingertip, blank on the back except for the Marvel logo, and has a nice weight from the metal it's made from. I'd give it 5 stars except mine came with a bubble in the resin on the front. It's only noticeable from up close. Still a great necklace charm!"
4.0,"It was really fun, but we had to help the kids open it up, many of the strings just came off. They loved it!"
4.0,Husband love this on me. He want me to buy more.
4.0,They fit nicely and are true to size. The top part didnt lay right on me unfortunately.
4.0,Very cute. Thin material. Has pockets.
4.0,Very nice jewelry. Did discolor some after wearing it. If you wear it for a long period of time such as few weeks/ months it will turn your skin green.
4.0,"This is great but not bendable to wear around my neck, too bulky. But I'm using it during our trip to Disney with my fanny pack so the clip isn't digging into me and it feels great and airy!"
4.0,Its manly for kids it is a bit small
4.0,"These are lovely. I wear them often, only thing is they are a little smaller than I thought they would be but that is my fault for not double checking size."
4.0,"I love this shirt and wear it with leggings. Note that the material is thick so if you get hot easily, it’s best worm in cooler or cold temps."
4.0,I usually wear a medium however I am 5' 9&#34; and I ordered a large for the length. They fit perfectly! Super soft and comfy!
4.0,These capris are very comfortable to work out in; as long as the workout isn't high cardio. I've found that they fall down quite often and I'm spending most of the time pulling them up. I wear them for lifting weights and yoga and they work just fine for that.
4.0,It's small but very cute
4.0,Nice color and patterns
4.0,Nice dress but wrong material. It’s the shiny rayon material. The fit and make of this dress was nice but didn’t care for the material
4.0,"Had it for a few months (4+) now and can't complain. Colors don't stain or fade. Sometimes I wish it has a &#34;backbone&#34; such as a plate or board to keep it's shape when I don't have any books in it, but it's not a big deal. Still working and still looking good."
4.0,"I thought this was definitely a different take on an old design, but now looking at the photos... I was wearing this blue lightning mask all wrong. the model shows it still going around the ears, but I put mine below my ears.  that's probably y I couldn't get the bottom to form correctly around my face.<br />I finally tried it again and it fit correctly.  I like the drawstring feature b/c it easily adjusts and u can wear it around ur neck (instead of hanging from ur earlobe) when u dont need it covering ur face.  u know like DRIVING IN UR CAR ALONE!!!!  I always laugh at those people when I see them on the road...  the mask is very lightweight and a little bit more on the silky feeling side than all of the masks I have purchased.  the only other 1 I have that feels as comfortable as this 1 is the 1 my mom made out of a wicking shirt we bought at Walmart.  neither 1 though has ANY covid-19 barriers in my opinion, but if u r looking for a mask to say that u r compiling, this might just be the one for u.  I hope this was helpful."
4.0,They are exactly what I was looking for.  Have not used them as of yet.
4.0,"This is absolutely adorable.  Although it did not fit quite as expected.  I got my normal size, but this is a little snug in the arms and shoulders and the material is not a stretchy or forgiving fabric. More like a thick gauze cotton. I would buy this again, but I would personally us a size to accommodate my shoulder width."
4.0,Very pretty and soft but very short.
4.0,Nice looking hat. Fit great and nice and light.
4.0,"This watch is a stunning Beauty. But with that said it got four stars because the strap lasted less than 20 hours , good thing I didn't buy for the strap"
4.0,It's cute but not sure that the quality of the material will last long.
4.0,"I love my necklace, the only problem the necklace gets tangled very easy."
4.0,Shirts fit well and dry quickly as advertised. I wear them for work under my FRCs
4.0,"This shoes are very confortable for a heel this tall... I like them a lot, I wear it everyday to work"
4.0,It's beautiful. I like
4.0,"Nice color. Fits well. Beadwork could be better, they came undone."
4.0,"I like these for low light conditions over my regular glasses, but they are a bit heavy and make the bridge of my nose sore.  I think they are a little pricey, but they work better than cheaper ones I have tried."
4.0,"Very comfy, soft material."
4.0,"My daughter liked the costume, but she said it was a bit itchy. She looked really cute in it, though!"
4.0,"These are nice, good quality, and they shipped really fast. The spacers are very obvious, so I probably won't use them, and the hoops with the beads are not captive beads like I expected, they just bend open and closed, and they aren't very easy to use. The rest I'm very happy with though, do I would say that over all, you definitely get way more than your money's worth"
4.0,It looks great just the right length color is nice it's very warm I think the material is a little itchy
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:b5bca82ffd9174d734abe459b9c570c2]] I ordered the Red. Not the vibrant red as they show. Bracelet i received was like a dull rust color. Still a pretty bracelet. It came in a nice jewelry box. I have a small wrist, 5 inches and measuring the inside of this bracelet was about 13cm."
4.0,"I ordered this to attend a function however it arrived 1 day late so I didn't get to wear it. I purchased in black and went up one size as recommended by the other reviews. The fabric is a nice weight, slightly stretchy. It is form fitting and figure flattering in my opinion, but I am definitely glad I went up one size. However the legs are extremely long and even with high heels it would have to be hemmed. I returned it because of the length of the legs. By the time I hemmed it to the length I wanted the silhouette of the legs would probably look weird so I am returning it. I am 5'4&#34; and I normally wear a size medium. I went up to a large and it fit perfectly but like I said the legs are really really long."
4.0,"This is a very soft shirt. That's the first thing that you notice about this shirt once you get it in your hands. It's so very soft. It's a terrific lounge shirt or yoga shirt. Upon falling sound asleep in it one day I found out that it makes for the most comfortable sleep shirt ever. Okay, not ever but still it's so comfortable to sleep in! It has a zipper part that runs offside up the front but it didn't get in the way of a power nap (deep longer than power nap status completely out nap). So, it's versatile when it comes to wearing it in the house or out.<br />This shirt looks great with a pair of jeans or any sort of yoga/exercise attire. I'm not a huge fan of the purple like I thought I would be. It's very pretty but I didn't like it as much with the plaid. The black on the other hand looks terrific with it.<br />All in all though this is a super soft super comfortable shirt that I am a big fan of."
4.0,Wish it came with care Instructions.
4.0,"These little Casio Watches are great. I was a schoolteacher for many years and I used the timer function for math quizzes for several years without ever needing a new watch. To the chagrin of many students the watch timer never quit!<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the wristband is pretty cheapo and small... than again, probably not many adults buy this one."
4.0,"They are nice, a bit smaller than anticipated but still great for casual or dressy, and good for work."
4.0,"I do like this jacket, but caveat for me is that even though I ordered a medium (which I usually pick as my size), it was a bit too big for me. I have a slim Asian body type and choosing the US medium was a bit big for me. It would have been better if I picked the small version, so if you still want the jacket and have a similar body to me.<br /><br />P.S. The picture of the green military-style jacket is slightly misleading. What I received did not have the belt closure as shown in the picture. The jacket is still pretty nice though!"
4.0,"The style is super cute and looks exactly like the photos. You'll look cute straight on. However, the band across your midsection is tighter than the rest, creating a mini bulge where there otherwise would not be. I'm also small-chested and the cups sit somewhat low and do nothing to help with that situation."
4.0,took a chance on it<br />will literally turn ur fingers purple unless you have like the world’s slimmest fingers<br />its okay definitely feels like it will break easily though
4.0,"Arms aren't loose fitting but the bottom of the dress is, it's ok"
4.0,"LOVE these, 2(X)ist never fail. Always sexy. Fit well and hold up forever."
4.0,"Really wanted to like these shorts. I love the stripes on the bottom and the angle the trim is cut at.... but they were too long and a little too baggy.<br />Maybe I'll find a better cut with a smaller inseam. Also were a little thin, but not bad enough that it would make me not wear them.<br />Had to send them back because of the length.<br />Otherwise cool shorts."
4.0,"They are nice and warm, but after even one washing, they get all bunched fuzzy."
4.0,Very cute but runs really small. I usually wear a medium or large and the XL shorts are still way too small.
4.0,Like the dress just was not for me. I don't like things tight up under my arm and neck. But its very nice and the quality looked good to!
4.0,"What i did not like about it is when i washed it the black bled into the white making the whit look murky and the whit angle across the tummy area is not very transparent so as a new mom i still have a baby bump and it shows everything, so if you are fluffy it will do the same ladies."
4.0,The producto was what I expected.
4.0,I love the dress only problem is a bit small for my boobs I'm a 34DD but that happens for me with most dresses anyways. I was very impressed with the quality for the price. I got a medium I'm currently 146 pounds and 5'3 the length was also a plus is perfect for me.
4.0,"Good value for the money. Very cute prints, very nice colors, soft material. However color fades after washing."
4.0,"This is a great option rather than buying a whole new umbrella.  Simply add the new canopy to your old pole and it is like new.  Usually the canopy wears out long before the pole.  This new canopy is relatively lightweight material not a true heavy canvas which is why I did not give 5 stars.  But it is easy to install and totally functional so I definitely recommend, especially for the price as opposed to a whole new one and needlessly throwing out a good pole!"
4.0,"Bought as a gift for my mother who plays golf in florida. Seems like a great light weight cooling hat. However, I bought the pink/ laser crimson hat and the color doesn't match the picture. It's more orange/bright coral that hot pink. I'm disappointed."
4.0,Material is a little thinner then expected but still a nice product
4.0,"I am very happy with this necklace.  The tree is very large, much bigger than I expected.  You can't really make out what the leaves say, but it doesn't take away from the charm of this necklace.  There is no clasp to put the necklace on/off, so you have to just fit it over your head, however the chain is large and there is plenty of room to do so without worry of breaking the chain.  This was a great purchase, and I am very satisfied."
4.0,"The wrap is warmer than expected; but, the comfort is fabulous!"
4.0,Love this dress!! It fit me perfectly!! I had to reinforce a stitch and iron it before I wore it but what do you expect for a 25 dollar dress. I will have it dry cleaned and will most definitely wear it again!!
4.0,Nice quality mask with vibrant colors and comfortable to wear.  I've been stung in the past with cheap masks that were washed out but not this one!<br /><br />Minus one star just because the price was a little high IMO.
4.0,"This dress is super cute! Based on reviews I sized up from my normal Medium to a Large. The dress fit in the chest cause it’s adjustable. But it was too tight at the waist. This material allows 0 give so there’s no stretch. I got it to close, but It definitely was uncomfortable to breathe in. But I like it so I’ll exchange it for a bigger size. I’d recommend sizing up 2 sizes."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised that this suit provided ample rear-end coverage like the picture. My rear is curvy and a lot of suits tend to ride up the middle if you know what I mean but this was very comfortable and flattering. The top was a pretty Aztec print with vibrant colors but I was disappointed that the little beads on the straps were not there (may have to zoom in to see). I thought that was a cute feature. The straps were just one solid strip sewn to the top instead of how the picture shows them split with bead detailing, so that's what gave it 4 star instead of 5. Fabric was nice, it felt like good swimsuit material, stretchy and smooth, not overly thin. It came with a built in bra that covered and worked pretty well. The halter top works good as a swimsuit but also looks great with shorts as just a halter top. It doesn't necessarily look only like a swimsuit top which I thought was nice bonus for the summer wardrobe. The large size fit true to the size chart. The color of the product description says &#34;brown&#34; but the bottoms were black and the top had a mix of coral, red, yellow, white, and black.<br /><br />I hope this review helps. If so, please click the &#34;Yes&#34; button below. Thanks!"
4.0,"This robe is super cute, however it is a little small. I would size up if you plan to buy"
4.0,Well made looks like hand banged out gold! light weight. Cute item.
4.0,Made well even though I used as gag gift.
4.0,good quality look and feel. can give as a gift and not worry. I would order again if I need to.
4.0,"Beautiful, but the stones are much more the color of garnets than rubies."
4.0,Super nice for the price
4.0,Again - it is as advertized and as such I like it.  It is very small - chain and penguin..  I have worn it and I like it enough to keep.
4.0,Super cute. I don't think this will be breathable at all. It runs small as well. The fit is good. I would size up. I'm returning as it will be to big to size up and just isn't the relaxed fit I hoped for.
4.0,"Not for people with boobs 34DD. Otherwise, a beautiful dress of good quality"
4.0,"They stretch out quite a bit, but they still seem to stay on my active 5 year olds foot. They might run a little big, especially after they stretch a bit, but not enough to return.  They seem to be holding up ok so far after several weeks of regular use. But most importantly, my son loves them!"
4.0,This was HUGE. I ordered a C and and am a decent C myself but WOW was this way too big. I wonder what band size they base these sizes off of??<br />Other than size it seemed to work okay? It was hard to test with it not fitting.
4.0,"I purchased a large (5'5&#34;, 170 lbs). With the proper smoothing undergarments, a large did not have the smooth, professional fit that I wanted so I returned it for an XL. OMG. Excellent outcome. Length is perfect with pumps or wedges but too long for flat sandals. Cleavage area: WOW!  Though more showed than what I wanted (for a particular event) there are so many ways to make this and all of these jumpsuits work; short camisole, lace bra, larger necklace, no underwire/push up bra, different belt, scarf belt...so much to love."
4.0,"I was sent this product for free in exchange for my honest review and I will honestly tell you that these are super cute. I wasn't sure they were my style at first but I like them! The tortoise print on these is fabulous and the quality is great. And you can't beat that price. Very trendy with the shape, yet classic with the print that is perfect all year long and for many to come."
4.0,good variety of colors and probably only good for 1 or 2 keys
4.0,This dress was really cute but sadly did not fit me.
4.0,Love the fascinator
4.0,This is a nice dress the fit could have been a bit better if maybe there were a tie in the back so you could cinch the waist in tighter but other than that it is great!
4.0,It was purchased as a gift that is yet to be given. It was the imprinted phrase that I was looking for and all that I looked at had the same concern about how small the printing was. So I accepted that reality and began to search for price. It is attractive and its durability is yet to be tested.  Arrived very quickly.
4.0,Very cute swimsuit. Unfortunately it is a neon red
4.0,"I bought this for my husband,  but they are too tight on him, I wish they had larger size"
4.0,"These came right on time, actually kinda early.  They are just as pictured. Simple yet elegant and long lasting quality, given the price like I said.  I would definitely recommend."
4.0,Product as promised lots of options to suit different types of automatic wind phones.  Very quiet
4.0,I loved the sleeve design but I hated the placement of them. Basically the sleeves are placed to far away from shoulders that it starts to hang off them instead of over (lots of readjustment). The material is a little itchy and the tank top part feels a little cheap.
4.0,Somewhat too small but cute. Good for a photoshoot.
4.0,I like the look.  A nice way to compliment any shape.  A little tough t get in and out of though.
4.0,This was a great dress for parties and photos
4.0,I love this vendor...they have beautiful items
4.0,Everything was packaged well. Nothing was bent or broken. I received it on time and was happy with the purchase.
4.0,"I love it and how flowy it is. I wish it had more stretch in it, but I still love it regardless!"
4.0,I would give it a 5 because it was super cute but it came with a button already popped off thankfully it was the second button down a scar can make due but a little disappointed because we don’t have time to return it for the event that she is wearing it to .
4.0,"I thought the pants ran a little small but my 10 year old loved the set. I would recommend purchasing one size up. Otherwise, they are great."
4.0,Wears a 10 toddler and her toes are to the end and they are hard to get on.
4.0,"I normally wear a US size large, but I'm pregnant and gaining weight, so I bought the next size up. It is a little too large, so I'd buy my normal size next time.<br /><br />The fabric is a little thinner than I like, but not see through. A little too low in the front  (I'm not interested in showing off my cleavage). Overall comfortable."
4.0,"This dress looks great on and is very flattering. I returned it because the embroidery on the arms was just a little bit itchy, and I really value comfort in my clothes. This means that I didn't like the thicker polyester, either. The black was appropriate for more than just casual occasions. I could have worn it to work, and almost wore it to an interview with a blazer. (I'm short, so I don't have to worry about length.) It is a great price if you want to look  really nice."
4.0,Bought more they where so good
4.0,"Smelled funny when I opened it. Was fine the next day or so. Looks great, very roomy. Just what I was looking for."
4.0,Became discolored after a while but was really pretty
4.0,"Cute dress, nice material and beautiful color. Returned because it was too large, but reordered size smaller."
4.0,It’s a cute shirt and great colors
4.0,Fits loose as pictured could of ordered a size smaller. I ordered the black dress and it is not see through. Goes perfect with wedges or maybe even converse! Will order pink one next!
4.0,The bracelets are very pretty. I was pleased when I got them but on wearing it for the first time it broke.
4.0,"Lice, light weight. I had to pinch the clasp shut to keep one closed, but it's been fine since then"
4.0,"Love the item, but chain just a little to long!"
4.0,I bought the blue in this dress and it was true to it's colour. It for really well. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the &#34;pattern&#34; on it could have been done better. It looks like the bare stitching which took away from it's elegance a bit.
4.0,"This is what I was looking for.  Simple but functional and arrived as advertised.  The plastic is nice and thick but the zipper a bit weak.  Will need to see how it holds up.  I like that it comes with 2 straps, as most do not."
4.0,"This is a really lovely top for the price. Great quality and detail. I wish it came in a xl for a little from flow at the bottom, but that's personal preference. The sleeves fit great, not restricted and i really am satisfied with my purchase. I plan on wearing this to a concert with my floral crossbody purchase i received for my birthday.<br /><br />Purchased with my own money."
4.0,These are cute and get the job done.
4.0,"I really liked how these look and feel. I’m normally a small but they were out so I ordered a medium and they fit but aren’t as tight on the waist as I would like. The color is super cute but it is way lighter than the picture. I expected a more dusty blue and they are a pretty pale blue. Although I do like them, I will be returning them because they came with a few stains on them."
4.0,"I was delighted to get knit pajamas in my size.  I am tall and it is hard to find long pants and sleeves.  They are comfortable.  As mentioned in another review the fabric is thin.  It is also clingy, so these are not something you want to wear to the store or on a video call. They are as warm as the fleece PJs I normally wear.<br /><br />My only complaint is  that they must be line dried."
4.0,"Well hmm. Depending on what your looking for in these. Super comfortable material.  Different pouch design.  Narrow cover strap. All works fine guessing for grower. But if shower or you get happy. The  tool in coming out the sides. Mesh on the twins does help venting, so no sweaty balls.<br />Comfortable and sizing are right on.<br />If looking for style or sexy do not look here. Baggy not flattering fit. Do not wear these if possibly of a state of undress is possible.  Comfortable yes yes . Sexy No No.<br />Your call."
4.0,So cute...bought this for my 4.5 year old granddaughter to wear on Thanksgiving and she was adorable!  Bonus...SHE loved it!
4.0,I got this as a for a friend. It was nicely packaged and decent quality.
4.0,Cute boots and pretty comfortable.
4.0,I bought these for my 2 year old and they are too big. But they'll be great when my tot grows into them.
4.0,"Love the necklace, however does change color on the edges over time"
4.0,I'm 5'6&#34; 120-130 lbs 34D chest. This swallowed me up. The length was good on me but would definitely fit someone bigger than me much better than it fits me. I realize it's supposed to be oversized but unless you're bigger than me it will be TOO big. The pic on model is misleading because I'm about her size and there's no way it fits like it does on the model. It's much bigger. This would be perfect and adorable on big gals
4.0,Fit was good out of the package new. I'll update this review after a few washes. Seem to be decent quality with no loose threads. There is some stretch and comfort is good when moving. I expected a much heavier material but these pants seem rugged and lightweight. It is a shame that Amazon delivery hasn't improved since they decided to do their own delivery instead of using other delivery services.
4.0,Great dress. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,"If I weren't fat I would have kept it. It fit well but my armpits spilled out, and they pushed up my breasts more than I expected, I didn't know this was a push up bra."
4.0,"No me gustó el fondo obscuro en los dijitos,,,,"
4.0,Ok but cheap
4.0,"love this wallet & replaced it with exact Buxton wallet I bought last August. Zipper broke after 5 months...maybe it was a flaw...so, I ordered a replacement & hopes new zipper is sturdier."
4.0,"Look great, but the magnets are small in diameter and hurt more than other magnetic earrings that i've had."
4.0,Nice material. Fit as expected
4.0,Cute t shirt!!!! Good quality material as well
4.0,"Even though this looks like a heavy metal necklace, it is actually light-weight plastic.  It is stunning and doesn't fail for attract compliments."
4.0,Really cute but shrunk in the dryer.
4.0,"I really like this shirt, however it is a lot shorter than expected. I read reviews and looked at pictures, but it is a lot shorter on me than others. Still cute, and fits well."
4.0,good tags
4.0,The end that screws on can come loose and fall off. Try using pliers to make sure it's tightened securely.
4.0,Bought for Halloween and really impressed with how nice it was. Wish specific sizes were available.
4.0,Nice but breaks easy.
4.0,Earrings are beautiful! Better than expected.
4.0,Good and simple!!
4.0,"5'10, 34 inch waist a 43 hips (12) and the large seemed to fit pretty well.  It is quite transparent so need nude underwear or not.  My nude bra didn't seem to be a problem."
4.0,"Loved these, and the fit well.  However, you might want to plan for shrinkage as they do seem to be a bit tighter once washed a few times."
4.0,I’m 192 lbs 36D from my chest I got an XXL the Bathingsuit is very cute and fits very nicely the only concern was it HAS NO BOOB SUPPORT! Ima have to costomize it by adding some cups or stretching the fabric to have more support
4.0,"The material of these cotton trousers is very soft and comfortable.  The draw string in the waist is a of a heavy woven type cotton and is very strong, unlikely to break in use.<br /><br />I ordered these for my Son who is tall and slender and he said that &#34;they are made for someone with a slim or athletic build, not for people with a heavy build&#34;.  He has worn them for a while and stated the only negative thing he has to say is they are not for tall people and as he is 6'4&#34; they are a little short at the ankles.  The fit otherwise is comfortable and the waist is close to size expected about one waist size off.<br /><br />I read in one other review that the trousers someone else bought and washed, bled dye onto other clothes in the wash.  The trousers I ordered are dyed very dark and could possibly bleed.  To avoid this from happening on a first washing I use Woolight for dark colors on a cold gentle cycle with the trousers by themselves.  Another tip is to add a cup of vinegar to the wash or a few tablespoons of salt."
4.0,"Super cute, and fits well overall! It isn't as loose as it seems to be in the photo, but the material is  super soft and the shirt is one of my new favorite."
4.0,"It's a lovely fabric and I can modify it the way I planned to. However, it's a bright red color, not even close to having a hint of purple or brown to make burgundy.<br />It drapes beautifully, and it has a lot of room.<br />I wish it had pockets! But it's great, besides the color issue."
4.0,"I love this watch. Beautifully tough. This really looks like a watch that Batman would use. Two things I'm not happy with: 1. Buttons are very hard to press (wouldn't be a problem for batman, but I'm a regular man), and 2. Mulribando doesn't work in South America... Shame on you Casio"
4.0,"I like the way these came packaged.  A nice soft wood type case to keep the glasses safe and scratch free.<br />Comes with a cleaning cloth, that a bit small, and a cloth bag to keep the glasses in.<br />I like the nice wooden arms of these glasses.  Can see so clearly when I'm wearing them while driving.<br />I'm not a real fan of the mirrored type lens.  I don't like looking at myself when I'm talking to people wearing mirrored lens so I know others must feel the same while talking to me when I'm wearing them.<br />They're not tight on the head where they cause pain after awhile.  I think those, who have smaller heads might have trouble keeping these on.<br />All in all I like these.  I like how well I can see with them on even in bright sunlight."
4.0,"Just ‘ok’ ties.  Nothing overly special.  Pretty colors, decently made.  They are the ‘skinny’ tie style tho, originally i missed the width in the description, so be aware."
4.0,"I bought this about 2 years ago.  The lower part of the outer zipper now won't stay closed and gets off track so I'm not zipping it up anymore (after several incidents of forcing the zipper back into its track).  the inside pocket upper left side frayed and unravelled even before this-- I have duct taped it to avoid further unravelling<br /><br />So I see that this model is not available anymore<br /><br />Just as aside I also have a vest which I did not buy on Amazon but the lower part of the outside zipper is having the same problem of going off track<br /><br />For something used for travel the outside/ closing zipper would probably be better with a two way zipper to alleviate the ""hip"" stretch when sitting.  Just saying"
4.0,Fits as excepted but is exceptionally cheeky if you have a big rump... Almost feels like a thong on me... Also shows quite a lot of side boob but I'm a d so it's to be expected... Overall great quality but I wouldn't wear it around kids or my family should be great on Mexico this summer though.
4.0,Great value.  Great look
4.0,Still beautiful and seems as they will hold up OK lightweight and great for a every day wear or a night out
4.0,"Lighter weight material than expected.<br />Print is in the style  of ""vintage "" to appear worn out a bit."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:cd1398e6ca5e4eaf511eefb005671dfa]] I got the bands in gray, pink and black today. My only complaint is that they are too big. They are a true size small and exact measurements for size small samsung brand. I have the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. I had to cut it or else it would have been in the way. Wish it came in a extra small. I deducted 1 star for having to cut it."
4.0,"This suit is very beautiful, however, the material given was meant for shorter size women as the work on the front didn't come down far enrough for me (I'm 5'7&#34;)."
4.0,I loved the style. The material is see through and requires a smooth body shaper to eliminate the look of  the thin see through fabric which tends to accentuate any bulges one may have.  The yellow color is lighter than the pic which appears to be more of a  bright mustard yellow.
4.0,"One of my favourite accessories recently. The metal is strong, and the details are great. It overall looks exactly like the picture. My only complaint is that I wish the designs came on both sides of the charms."
4.0,"I found this piece when I was looking for a similar bcbg jumpsuit, and this was a fraction of the price, so I had to give it a try. I was surprised at the quality and cut. The lace is not too low or revealing, and the material has quite a bit of stretch to it. But overall still runs small. Great customer service though."
4.0,"These are very comfortable for my very sensitive ears. Maybe I was mistaken  but these are balls with tiny cubic zirconia  stones in them and are not solitaires which I wanted. Still, they are so comfortable I like them anyway."
4.0,"Driving at night has always been a struggle.  My prescribed glasses with all the necessities, UV protection, anti-glare, etc doesn't work well.  Adding this product help add another layer of blocking the glare from those driving with high-beams or halogen lights."
4.0,my rv they looked to be very nice
4.0,Very nice tracksuit however it runs very long. I'm only five three and a half and it covers my feet and then some. The material is very good quality however this particular style ran larger than the other styles. Because of the stretch I would suggest a size down
4.0,I like the material but it fits somewhat small. I'd advise going up a size.
4.0,The gray runs smaller then any of the other colors. But my black and marron ones fit wonderfully! Love the tummy control! And the pockets I can go the store without a purse and still have my cards and phone
4.0,"Love the dress. Wore to my daughter’s wedding. Back was too low for me, though."
4.0,"Bought these for my daughters winter performance. She loves wearing them. They’re nice and classic enough to match with anything. The heel isn’t too big. She’s normally a size 12.5, but when it came it was too big for her. We exchanged it for a size 11.5. I would advise to go by the size chart in the description."
4.0,cute pattern and style is expected. only downside is that the material is very thin and almost see through.
4.0,"It’s very cute but the smell of I guess either the material or paint is very strong. I had to put it out the window so air could help eliminate the strong scent but no results yet . But it seems good quality also . But they have to do something with the scent especially that the bag are for children,"
4.0,Comfy but could be a little more supportive!
4.0,"This matched the description, sadly the color wasn't exactly what I'd hoped for but it was close. Its a very lightweight fabric so don't count on keeping warm, but it will keep your dress modest or cover up your upper arms if that's your goal."
4.0,Looks good but material does not breathe like a cotton would.
4.0,"So, they fit pretty good and it's a good deal.<br />There is just one thing.  Out of the packaging they smell bad.  I can't place the smell, but it's probably just industrial manufacturing or something.<br />Toss them in the washing machine with soap and bleach. (careful what you mix with bleach) Then dry with fabric softener."
4.0,"This is such a super cute romper! I gave it 4 stars only because the v-shape in the front is too low for my taste. I had mine resawn, so that my chest isn't fully exposed--it all boils than to your personal preference. Overall, I highly recommend this product. The color gray is great, but I am more impressed with the fitting. It looks stunning especially with some heels on. I can't wait to wear mine this weekend 😁!"
4.0,"Not too shabby looking for cheap bowler.  Great for a costume but isn't going to beat a true bowler.  However, at this price there isn't much to complain about."
4.0,"In spite of the fact that the description includes mesh in it, I was not expecting mesh on my pants, but otherwise they are just fine."
4.0,"I am enjoying this handbag it is large enough to carry my iPad (why I purchased it).  The major downside is the separators inside are not very useful from the big pocket to the smaller pocket, I wish they were a little more stable"
4.0,Very cute fun gift for a friend who has a quirky sense of style. They look just like the picture :)
4.0,"They look nice, but were actually bigger than I thought (I have tiny hands however). Problem is all of them were too big so it was almost impossible for me to wear without it falling off, so I had to use pliers to reshape them and make them fittable (which was a pain by the way). Also since I read that the paint chip (and they have while I was refitting them), I decided to paint them with a matte coat of nail polish and now they look lovely, and will probably last longer too."
4.0,It’s cute. Neckline is definitely low. I could only wear it with that neckline to a few places. I sewed it up a bit to wear to a family event.
4.0,"The straps are a little to log, the end of the band hits up against the watch"
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34; 155lbs and usually wear a M/L in tops and dresses.  I ordered and XL based on reviews and it was the correct size.  I technically love this dress because it *almost* fits me well .... the exception is that it is entirely too short.  I contemplated keeping it and just wearing black boyshirts underneath, but any movement on my part exposes my butt.  I'm am saddened to return this.  If only it were a few inches longer...<br /><br />Side note: It's not completely sheer, but sheer enough that you'd see any underwear that didn't match the shade of your skin."
4.0,I bought these to wear to work because I work in a cold environment and I have COPD.  They are truly helpful...I only wish they didn't have the nose feature as it causes my glasses to steam up.  Other than that...it works GREAT!
4.0,"Soft slipper and I like them, very comfortable after I fixed one thing. The ties on the sides won't stay tied and kept flopping on the floor or inside the shoe so I just removed them. This works fine as they are not really necessary. Also the back is very soft and flops inside the shoe when I go to put them on so I must always hold that in place until I get them on. I use them as an inside shoe as here in Alaska we all remove our shoes inside homes."
4.0,"I attached my this to my keys, so I know where my keys are in my purse. I am happy with my purchase and the key chain is really cute, but they are Really loud."
4.0,It was as it looked in the picture.  The Logo looks like it may eventually fade but hoping it doesn't since it states &#34;USA Laser Engraved logo will never fade&#34;.  Good quality for the price and shipping was really fast.
4.0,"As a diabetic the top shelf shoe for me is an Orthofeet brand. This is OrthoComfort brand and is much cheaper. It has good support, just not as good as the Orthofeet. I tried some hushpuppy brands and those were no go. So this is the best I have found except Orthofeet, even matched Dr. Comfort brands - so I am pleased. All in all I still need to switch shoes about twice per day for max comfort."
4.0,"This is a really cute bathing suit and I do like the way it fits. The only thing I'd recommend the manufacturer changes is the ruffles on the shoulders. They should have the pattern/color on both sides because it looks a bit ridiculous when it turns over and it's white. Makes it look pretty cheap. Otherwise, great product! Just ensure you pay attention to your suit and the way it lays on your shoulders."
4.0,Loved this dress and had tons of compliments. It was sewed together with the top and bottom backwards. I turned it around and worked fine. It is however a little bit big.
4.0,"Took a while to get it, but I LOVE it!"
4.0,"comfortable!!! I was leery of having no backing for my feet, the fit really pleasantly surprised me."
4.0,"Beware of loose threads. I bought 20 of these t-shirts in various colors. They look and feel great. They are a little bit delicate because I noticed if you fold them inside out most of the shirts I got had loose threads in the underarm area and the bottom of the shirt on the sides. I guess their sewing machine isn't properly tying off the stitch. I found a little trick, but only if you are confident not to burn your shirt....take a lighter and burn the end of the loose thread until right before it gets too close to the shirt, I use my breath to blow it out right away and after that it will seal the stitch just like a good knot would. I don't recommend this unless you have done this before with loose threads. But other that the loose thread problem the shirt looks very nice and tapers around me nicely."
4.0,A true classic!!!  Brings me back to my childhood when I first started wearing watches.  You can't beat the price also 👊🏻👌🏻
4.0,They jacket is really nice but the size seem off. I got a large fit like medium. Returned and got xlarge and its still a little snug like maybe I should of got a extra large? But im going to keep it.
4.0,"The material is actually pretty cozy, but definitely order a size up, the crotch Inseam is a little too short. I'm not thrilled but it'll work"
4.0,"I bought this as something to wear to the beach or out on a date with my husband but I think it will become pajamas instead.  Very comfy and it fits well, I feel.  I'm 259 lbs and I normally wear somewhere between a 16W-20W depending on how it's cut.  I ordered the largest size XXXL, which is only supposed to fit a 14, so this is very roomy and may run large but it means us big girls can wear it too. So yeah!!<br />I definitely could put on a nice cardigan, cute jewelry and pretty heels and wear it out but like I said before this will probably only be pajamas."
4.0,Filled our needs. Easy to pack for an Alaska cruise. Probably not durable but good for several uses in my opinion.
4.0,I like the outfit wrong color. But it worked for the event I was attending
4.0,"The purse was not quite as tall as I’d imagined, but still overall a very pretty bag. I'm excited to use it!"
4.0,These boots look great on but they do run small. Wish I would have read the reviews more closely before buying. What I am not pleased with is the price difference in just half a size. I sometimes take a size 8 and since there was a 20.00 dollar difference I took a chance. But I regret it now as my feet were in a lot of pain by the end of the night. I definitely needed the 8.5. Since there is such a price difference in just half a size and that they run small I would not recommend these to a friend.
4.0,"I really love this bracelet.  Kind of makes me remember my high school days but with a modern twist. The only down side is that it gets loose easily so slides around on your wrist, but easy enough to tighten up again.  I would recommend this bracelet highly.  In fact, I actually bought this as a Christmas present but loved it so much I kept it and ordered two more for my daughter and sister!"
4.0,Very good quality.  Not as bright as the picture though
4.0,"I have pretty long legs and they’re long enough, could be a little longer probably but they fit"
4.0,Very warm and super cute!  Wish they were just slightly longer.
4.0,"This blouse is sexy and comfortable,  would purchase again."
4.0,"Beautiful outfit! While I was on my Vegas Vacation,  I received so many compliments on it but the rhinestones were coming off, so I already know that I left a trail of them😒 It was not a lot but enough of them!"
4.0,"Trim is pretty sloppy, but you get what you pay for! Actually not bad for the price, but I’m super picky about how my pajamas feels and can’t actually wear the bottoms to bed because the elastic waist is too tight for my preference. Great for lounging!"
4.0,Great fabric.  Super soft
4.0,"This is such a gorgeous, versatile scarf! First, it is a lot of fabric: 74&#34;x 32&#34;, which offers the wearer many options for styling, ranging from a looped scarf, to a wrap, to a long shawl. It is a very delicate, lightweight, 100% Polyester with floral, fringed lace (100% nylon) that does feel fragile, so it is recommended hand-wash only; and to be line-dried. The Lilac color is such a pretty, feminine lavender shade. This will be a gorgeous accessory to any outfit, especially in the Spring/Summer when you go from the heat outdoors into air-conditioning, or as the temperature drops with the sun. I think it could easily be dressed up or down. My vocalist daughter wears a lot of scarves, and loved everything about this! The price is a bit high for what it is, but I think it will get a lot of use because of the range of use. I'd love to get it in black!"
4.0,"The material is wonderful, but yes the size runs very small. I suggest a XL if you really want it to be loose enough."
4.0,Great slippers for the price!  I've had them a month and they are very comfortable.
4.0,"Pretty summer dress; it's a tad small, not sure a size up would help since it's a clingy fabric."
4.0,"Great set for the price. Only issues I have had are the zippers being flimsy, and it takes a few uses to get the &#34;packaging smell&#34; out of the material. I just put dryer sheets in them overnight. Helped."
4.0,Nice for the price daily wear studs.
4.0,I had to return it :(
4.0,"Little bigger than I thought it would be, but it is good."
4.0,I like the different layers and the option of taking the fur out. I haven't had a chance to wear it because it's not cold enough yet
4.0,"Be warned. This case is rugged AF and appears to be EVERYTHING PROOF. Water proof, shock proof, snow proof, etc. Its constructed pretty well and your iwatch feels safe in there... If youre like me, and you like to hike, run, swim, jump off things and generally partake in activities that can cause bodily harm... but you also like tech. Then you need a case like this. Be warned it’s a bit on the bulky size, but it does everything as advertised."
4.0,I love the dress. It did have a hole in the pocket area.
4.0,These earrings are very pretty and appear well made with quality materials.  The only (very slight) disappointment I have is that they are smaller than expected.
4.0,"Nice thin watch that works seamlessly with wearing long cuffed sleeves, slides right in. Clean classic design."
4.0,"Ok so these sneakers are sweet on my 6 year old. One issue we have is she is a do-it-youself girl and she can't do it herself with high-tops. Because they are so narrow on top you have to unlace them to the very bottom, it's def. worth doing, they look so sweet on her. The go with everything she wears; dress, pants, it doesn't matter they look cute."
4.0,Great eatings used for my little ones who figured out she could pull her earrings out! Now she can’t!!
4.0,"I was admittedly frustrated that the three packs all come with at least one good awful color -no one outside the service is going to need a white nylon belt. It looks weird with anything you wear it with.<br /><br />That said, the grey and the black both look fantastic, and they're a good quality that I'm sure I'll get more than a fair amount of use from. I was debating these vs a few others, and having tried them out I don't regret my decision. Good buy."
4.0,Beautiful strap.  Very soft and comfortable.  Slightly too large for me but I have a small wrist.
4.0,"I usually wear a small, but bought a medium and it was still a little small. Very pretty and feminine, though, as long as I don't button it. Then it pulls at the buttons."
4.0,Buen tamaño alcanza d todo
4.0,"I love this little bag. One problem though, I have had it a month and the stitching on one of the handles has come apart. I fixed it by hand myself so I can continue using it. It's got lots of little pockets to store away my things separately and safely. I would still recommend this bag despite my little problem."
4.0,My son has not taken off since it arrived.  Perfect fit for my 5 year old.
4.0,looks stylish on my sister
4.0,"This product is nice and functional for what it was designed for but it is a wee bit small and therefore will not hold large helmets. No way will it fit a full combat rig with mask and all.<br /><br />For the bikers types, it easily fits a half helmet (or 3/4) with some extra road gear but my Modular/Full Coverage Brain Bucket (size: XL) won't squeeze through the zipper. I later ordered some oversize helmet bags (from a pilot supply website) to carry my gear and gave this bag to my wife who uses it to pack stuff when traveling by car back and forth to visit family."
4.0,"It fits a bit snug where the buttons are, the buttons are seriously  a sec away from a button pop. But you really can't tell with a cardigan sweater . You just button the sweater partially; if you know what I mean.  It has to be the fit of the buttons because the dress is not tight! Anyway, everyone loves this dress. More than a few women complimented this dress and stated that it looked like a designer dress; one of which I can't recall the designers name.. Anyway, I think the dress is very modest; and beautiful."
4.0,"This initial pendant far exceeded my expectations. It’s so beautiful, and comes with a very nice chain & a beautiful gift box. Can’t believe how nice it is for this price, don’t hesitate to purchase this lovely pendant !!"
4.0,Good fit and love that it has pockets
4.0,The band is easy to install and remove from your watch face. Once on it slips on easily and can be secured quickly. It's a stylish slim look that goes well with both casual and dressy outfits.
4.0,"I am 260lbs, 5'6 so I got a 3x. It's baggy at my back (the top/maroon part) but that may be because I don't have a lot of chest to fill it out. The bottom part (plaid) does rise up over my stomach though so I have to re adjust every now and then. I probably could have gotten a smaller size but then I think I would have had issues with the arms. They are pretty much a perfect fit/snug.<br /><br />It's still a pretty dress and comfortable. The bottom half is a thick fabric so this may be better suited for spring/fall."
4.0,i love the quality aside from the fact that there are some with black splotches on them. i made cute earrings and plan to make more with them.
4.0,"Super cute, great addition to making bracelets necklaces or earrings"
4.0,The measures are not exact
4.0,I did not receive the spatula
4.0,"This was surprisingly soft inside- I thought it was going to be just a very thin layer of polyester.<br /><br />One side is kind of fuzzy, which was a pleasant surprise. It may be too much for summer, however.<br /><br />It's got a stretchy cord in the top hem that can be adjusted, which is fantastic.<br /><br />It's a great size. I'm about the size of an average man and could pull it over my head easily, without struggling. I was concerned it might be too small, coming from China.<br /><br />Very pleased, it only took a little bit of time to ship but other than that, solid purchase, would buy again."
4.0,"Beautiful, sturdy belt. Don’t have the smell of leather. Perfect 👌"
4.0,this looks very cheaply made with an offputting gold tone that makes it look cheaper something you would get out of a gumball type machine.<br />tge locket idea is very nice and expands.  the recipient loved she was able to  put so many pictures in it.  its cheaply made but the price was really cheap too.  you get what you pay for
4.0,"Husband loves these, warm and comfortable."
4.0,Really wish they had a 4xl but I could only order the 3xl. I am curvy with a smaller waist then hips and butt. But it will work. Just will wear my thigh shaper to help with the rising as I walk. This skirt has very little stretch to it.
4.0,"These undies are lightly supported. Definitely will help hold your tummy in but not retroactively so. The cotton materiel is thiner than some undies I have purchased but that's okay - there are seasons where you don't want really thick panties, even 100% cotton ones. I like the color varieties and the price was really good for the set of 6. Other offers were the same price for only 2-4 undies.  I have recently gained weight and need to lose a few pounds. Then they will fit much more comfortably."
4.0,I would buy as a gift!
4.0,It's light weight but fits snug .....not too tight.<br />I like it and will probably buy another one in another color.
4.0,"Shirt fits well as expected since it's main purpose is for exercising. It also makes a all around good breathable shirt for casual outings as well. I actually purchase this for casual use, I would hope they make more color offerings."
4.0,Top is super cute!  Love the style.  You need to be mindful of the snap button closer on the top.  The first on I had to send back...
4.0,Pretty dress but quite see through. Ended up sending back as it wasn't quite what I was looking for.
4.0,I like a lot but extra material in stomach area.
4.0,"This is a great price for a Helly Hansen jacket. I love the jacket. It is very thin and packable. It is also waterproof, but I wouldn’t use it as a heavy weather jacket on the boat, I use it for light rain days. I wear it all the time though, it has become a go to on messy days. It looks good and the color is great. I took one star off because the Helly Hansen logo is cheap looking.  This is not the super premium you get with other more expensive Helly Hansen clothing but for the price they charge for this one you have to expect that."
4.0,"product is fine, as ordered"
4.0,"Fits good, some of the Neon lighted up sections are not as bright as others, I guess once the battery wears out will have to replace as there's no way to recharge the batteries?"
4.0,"Cute shirt, I didn't realize the bottom was elastic though."
4.0,"This skirt is beautiful; flowy and drapey. The chiffon is or is near to a full circle and hangs gorgeously. The one drawback I had with it is that it was not as long as I had hoped. I wanted a skirt that hung on the floor so I ordered an x-large. I am 5'2"" and my toes still peeked out the bottom and with shoes seems even shorter. Also, the white is not a clear white, more creamy, but definitely still white."
4.0,"The case came in about a month before the expected delivery date; that's always nice. It's really cute and a great product for what you pay. I would give it 5 stars, but it is a bit too thick around the buttons, so I have to squeeze my finger into the hole to press them. The background color is more of a cream than a white, incase that makes a difference..."
4.0,Armholes were disproportionately too small for a large. Very small armhole to armhole in the back. Returned.
4.0,"These clasps were a little large for the project I was working on, but I was able to find other uses for them. Large selection of colors and colors are vibrant."
4.0,Not quite what I was looking for.
4.0,"I love all things lotus, so when I saw this necklace I almost drooled! The fact that it's sterling silver and one of the more affordable lotus necklaces I could find sealed the deal! I read the reviews, and true to them, the chain is extremely short (which is the only reason I'm knocking a star off of this review). I love the pendent and I have placed it on a different chain. I wear it all the time and regularly get compliments on it, and I'm so happy with my purchase."
4.0,I enjoy this item!
4.0,Very nice quality. Arrived quickly.
4.0,Very pretty for a little girl and made well
4.0,They are by far the best driving sunglasses I've ever owned.
4.0,"I didn’t read the tags, but you probably aren’t supposed to tumble dry them. I did. They shrunk up in length a good couple inches.  They were going to need hemming anyway, so it worked out in my case.  Professional enough to wear to work with a blazer. I’d recommend them."
4.0,"The costume was great, but the shoes had very thin foam soles which would have been fine if the shoes were a little bigger so I could wear them over a pair of shoes, but they were too small to fit over even my shoes with the thinnest of soles."
4.0,"Bought for a 12 year old, so on an adult, probably would fit as expected. One small warning - Do Not wash in machine without a garment bag. Fringe will stretch, fray and tangle horribly."
4.0,"I loved the dress!! I am 5, 5&#34; about 130lbs and wear a 34C. I ordered a small and it fit great. I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments. I would have given the dress five stars, but once I put it on I was trapped in it. The zipper would not unzip. So when I went to take it off at the end of the day my husband had to break the zipper to free me. Other than that, I would say a five star dress."
4.0,"Very solid pack! Enough room for what I need in a ""get home"" application. So far,  all the zippers are holding strong, more enough area with molle attachment capabilities,  the pack is very well constructed with plenty of room.<br />My only true gripe- I ordered the tan pack,  too my surprise the ""tan"" is very green in hue. That was disappointing,  but... oh well."
4.0,"I love Baltic Amber beads/stones and when I lost my favorite bracelet I opted for this one. Its beautiful and exactly like the picture. I'm considering to buy more for my friends and family as gifts in the future. I'd even wear a necklace of this if it matched.<br /><br />The only con I had is the twist clasp. It's really hard to do by yourself. I couldn't even do it with my teeth! I don't like to shower or bathe with jewelry. While I'll make an exception for quick showers, I don't recommend allowing it to soak or to swim with it on."
4.0,"Nice loose fit, color a bit darker than shown."
4.0,Not the highest quality but about what I expected from the picture. There's something about the material that makes me fearful that the edges might start to fray after a few months. I'm happy with the purchase though.
4.0,"I wanted to complete my daughter's 50th day of school outfit, and these glasses were the perfect touch. Decent price, fast shipping and an adorable look."
4.0,"Very cute, they’re a bit long and my daughter has pretty long legs but they do bunch a little at the bottom. The front/back are interchangeable so the only complaint I have is that the crotch are kind of hangs a little lower than what it should after a while. Just have to keep pulling them up and it’s fine. The fleece lining is very soft and comfy! Overall, they’re a good buy for the quality."
4.0,"Based on the description, I was expecting a hat that could sit well on your head.  The opening is very large, a one size fits all, but most people will possibly need to reduce the size by buying the additional hat reducer bands offered on Amazon.  Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"i love these earrings. you can barely tell they're clip-ons. and i get so many compliments, the only complaint i have is they're some-what bendy and if you happen to sit  or step on one, you will never get it back to being straight. overall great for gifting"
4.0,My daughter loves this. Great purchase.  Does look a little cheaper made.
4.0,"Great product for the price, looks awesome"
4.0,I bought this for Middle East Dress up and absolutely loved it but it's not so comfortable to wear
4.0,"Is slightly thinner material than expected, but I don’t dislike it.  Has a good custom fit which I like - not a bulky sweatshirt."
4.0,"Super cute! Lots of colors to pick from. Durable for my active on the spectrum pre school age boy. Perfectly priced. Not as expensive as Nike or Under armour, yet not as cheap as Wal Mart."
4.0,"the frames are white, not silver, you can't tell that in the picture.<br />LOVE the wider arms, which is why I wanted this pair."
4.0,Love the pants. The buttons needed a touch up but so far gold nail polish has done the trick.
4.0,"Too small for my wrist.... other than that, pretty much flawless. I'm a big dude, with big hands and wrists. It's  an average sized man's watch"
4.0,good as expected
4.0,I got a small and it fits great. I have washed it and it washes nicely.
4.0,Bought for my teenage granddaughter. I gave her my strand of pearls two years ago and she wears them on special occasions. The pearls were the same size and perfect for her. She is beautiful and does not like a lot of jewelry. She loves pearls because they are so traditional and girly.
4.0,"Great, but need to be washed by hand or washed with cold water, otherwise great product."
4.0,"Very cute, but the edges are a little sharp. I added a few coats of clear nail polish to the edges and that seemed to resolve it. Otherwise it's super cute and gets the job done."
4.0,"Ordered extra large was a tad small bought another 2XL... Much more room, which obviously is the point in lounging gear. Nice fleece material. It would prefer it to be a little longer."
4.0,"If you have a hard time with lip studs, the 6mm length is tougher than normal to put in. I didn’t go with the 8mm because someone mentioned it was too long, but it would be a preferred length.<br />The booklet’s text is too small to easily read."
4.0,Cute dress but not as expected. Dress is great for a 15-20 year old.
4.0,"I only gave a 4 because they do fall off easily. We find them, but I do wish they fit a bit more snug. Other than that they cushion the glasses and I really like them."
4.0,Great variety of colors however won’t stay on long
4.0,This is the first band that I bought for my Apple Watch out of amazon<br />The price is good compared to apple bands<br />The shape fancy and the quality is good<br />Overall it is good
4.0,My wife loved these and ordered two pair.  They did have  very minor scratch on the lens but was barely noticeable.
4.0,"So cute and it arrived a lot sooner than I expected. I usually wear a medium but got a small and I'm glad I did, medium would have been too big."
4.0,"These little boots are SOOOO cute! We get lots of compliments every time she wears. them. They are easy to get on and they stay on very well. She can pull them off but usually only does if she's in her car seat so I assume that means they're pretty comfortable. :) Haven't worn them outside much so I don't know how well they hold up in the elements. I do wish they had a little more rubber on the bottom, as they're slippery on our hardwood floors, but overall very pleased with these boots!"
4.0,"It was just like the picture, only thing it had a plastic feel to it ...but it's nice"
4.0,"We bought these for our upcoming trip to Banff, and they seem like they will work pretty well.  My 14 year old son thought that they look really cool.  He and I both wear a size 10, but my feet are wider.  I can't comfortably wear these with regular socks, much less thick ones, but he can with his narrow feet.  Also they have a pretty strong chemical smell.  Hopefully that will wear off.  They have a good tread on the soul and look like they will turn water well."
4.0,Super cute dress. Comfy and fits as pictured.
4.0,"It’s a cheap plastic feeling fabric, reminded me of a kids tent. But you get what you pay for. I put an iron on of the kids name on it so it can take heat without melting if you plan on doing the same. I was hoping for a more plain fabric material rather than plastic like but that’s not a big deal, I should’ve read the description better."
4.0,"My 14 year old loves these shorts.  Took a while to be delivered, but she says they are comfortable."
4.0,"This is adorable. It fits perfectly & look authentic except it’s a little more golden. Was unsure how to open at first, then I realized that the clover stays attached to the initial piece. It’s easy to take on and off. I think I’m in love 🥰"
4.0,they work well ... and fit over my glasses ...
4.0,"I kinda expected it to be sweater material but it is more cotton and not as stretchy.  It is very flattering and comfortable however.  Fits as expected, the &#34;yellow&#34; that looks mustard in the pic is close to what I got.  It may be my display.  The item received is a bit more yellow than the pic.  Overall very happy with it."
4.0,"I carry a lot of things around as a professional woman on the go all the time, so I've been shopping around for a spacious tote bag that can fit my laptop, phone, tablet, personal items, papers, chargers, and folders. When Melete offered me this bag for a small discount for review purpose, I happily accepted.<br /><br />Out of the box, this bag impresses with its size, leather smell, and elegant design. It looks a lot like the more expansive designer handbags of this size. I got the brown colored one and really like the look of the full-grain leather and how smooth it is. There are many many pockets inside and an outer pocket for your phone. The outside pocket is sadly just a little too small to fit my Blackberry Priv. Well, it fits, but I have to purposefully insert the Priv at the right angles, so essentially it isn't worth it for me. There is great attention to detail in the stitching, and the workmanship seems to be of high quality. I'll update as time go on to review about how it holds up.<br /><br />The straps are a little thin, but they do not look cheap. The leather is of good quality, though I wish that the leather fur didn't show at the top edge of the bag. Essentially because the leather is already thick enough (full grain leather), Melete did not double side the non-lined part at the top, and the leather fur showed through. Other than that I'm very happy with this bag. It's big, beautiful, stylish, and seems to be durable. I've attached some photos in case you want to see more."
4.0,"To set the day of the week you must keep turning the small stem that sets the hour many, many times to get past midnight for the day to change.<br /><br />I received my watch on a Saturday, the watch showed Wednesday like in the photo, can't tell you how many turns of the stem it took to reach Saturday.<br /><br />Best bet before activating the battery, wait until the day of the week that appears in the window arrives, then activate the battery, set the time etc."
4.0,The grey one faded to black in a day and the animal heads faded in two but it’s worth the money in my opinion. They are pretty cool. Just don’t wear them every day
4.0,"I have very large hands. My mother tells me that I was born with them?? Anyway, I have a terrible time finding gloves that I can actually wear and lo and behold, these do pretty good. We work on water wells and handle rusty old pipe all day long. I started wearing these gloves and my hand injuries have been reduced considerably.. They protect from abrasion really well. The only downside is that they do wear out rather quickly, but what can one expect from a very competitively priced glove? I usually wear out a pair a day when working water wells."
4.0,"If you're sporting excess Pandemic weight, not a flattering cut. I look frumpy in them and they're fine for house chores. Once I shed a few pounds, I expect I'll wear them in public. For Skinny Minnies - they'll be fabulous!"
4.0,"Purchased this in a large for a part to a Halloween costume. The rope binding in the V on the chest felt a little cheap, but for the price it was still perfectly fine. I didn't really care for the choker band at the neckline - it was not tight and hung loose, and was more annoying than it was flattering. I purchased a Large, and it hit mid-thigh on me. (5'6&#34; 170lb, large chest)"
4.0,"They run a bit small, but not enough that I needed to send them back. The material isn't as soft as I thought they would be. They are a bit rough and like nubby cheap fleece blankets.  But they are cute so I'm ok with them."
4.0,"These are not cashmere. They are polyester blend and not very soft. The hole for the thumb is fairly tight, and I have medium sized hands plus also makes them harder to take off and not as comfortable to wear. The open finger area works well to wear while typing when a little extra warmth is needed. I got them for this reason for work. As the material is not bulky this helps while typing, but also makes them not as warm as bulkier gloves so you may need something else if you are very cold. These are good for a little warmth and good range of motion for fingers."
4.0,"It is not super soft on the inside like most brand new sweatshirts but it looks exactly like the picture and it fits well. The colors are bright and vibrant and so far it hasn't shrunk, bled, or faded."
4.0,"These shoes are flirty and fun to wear.  I would not recommend wearing them for a long day though.  The shoes are for ""showing off"" your legs and feeling sexy for a night out on the town."
4.0,Fits great looks nice very vibrant colors on the shoe highly highly recommend
4.0,"A bit tight at the waist even though I followed the sizing chart, but otherwise cute."
4.0,"Runs a little on the small side but really cute shorts! Good thickness, tiny bit of stretch, have received tons of compliments already."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this little gown! I expected yet another cheap bit of fabric from overseas, and don't get me wrong, it is that - but it's the best example of why people started buying them in the first place. I'm 5'3&#34;, 38DD, roughly size 8, I ordered the Large and it fit me slightly loose. I had to adjust the straps alllll the way as short as they could go to get any kind of support, but once I did, I found the gown to be really flattering for cleavage. There is also significantly more space between the panels than you'd expect. It's GREAT for standing and other things, but it is not flattering for sitting down, relaxing, or &#34;sex flirt&#34;. :D  I'd suggest this if you've got medium to slightly large breasts, but any smaller or larger just won't work."
4.0,Cute. My son loves. And puts on himself. He always wants to wear them
4.0,Chain did not want to slide thru the loop in top of the K
4.0,makes me look professional
4.0,"Great looking, cheap watch. My husband loves it"
4.0,I believe this was made for women.<br />Height is Way too high!
4.0,"Got this in green size Large.  I’m 5’2 and usually wear size 2-6, women’s XS/S tops and S-M bottoms.  Fit at the waist is good (elastic only on backside and plenty of room for flow in skirt).  Length is a true midi fit for the short gals.  Have yet to actually wear it anywhere though. Mostly polyester fabric. Not see through."
4.0,Looks really cute keep out of water it will tarnish
4.0,I love these earrings!!! Very pretty and the perfect size. They dangle but are not too big. I bought them to wear to a wedding but I know I will get tons of use out of them!!! ☺
4.0,True to size. Very happy with my purchase!
4.0,Loose fitting and comfortable. Perfect for workouts!
4.0,"Medium hugs my curves. Large would be unflattering. So the dress is a bit sexier than I thought. Otherwise, very comfortable fabric, looks transparent but isn't while standing. Still recommend a slip to avoid anxiety."
4.0,I loved it and would have given 5 stars except for the fact that it broke after about three weeks. :(
4.0,"These are very nice for me, however I am 5'2"" and have relatively small hands. They fit perfectly, so that is refreshing for me. The are not too busy..... so I am wear them for casual."
4.0,"This is one of those times when I truly wish I could give select 4.5 stars out of 5. The gloves really do seem exceptional. They are very comfortable and slip on like they were made just for you. The only caveat is the thumb seams are a little long on both gloves, causing you to have a little flap on both thumb tips which interferes with texting more than anything but it’s still completely usable. And just to be clear, it’s not from “short thumbs”, my thumb goes all the way in without going any further, there is still just a little malformation of the seam that hangs out.<br /><br />Bottom line, great gloves, especially for the price, just not “perfect”. I highly recommend them."
4.0,It fit perfectly and hid my mommy belly wonderfully.  I loved the look of it.  It's the first time I bought a bathing suit online and it's the best fitting one I ever had.
4.0,Obsessed! Definitely buying another one in a different color.<br />The material is amazing and it's super soft!
4.0,Fills bigger to size. L feels like XL
4.0,"Fits nicely, but a little looser in the waist than I would have liked"
4.0,Played pickleball in this for our halloween party.  Nicely stretchy!  The only drawback is that the neck bone image was off to the side and out of alignment with the rest of the skeleton's spine.  I'll be wearing this one again.
4.0,Goodddd
4.0,Very pretty Blouse
4.0,Haven't worn out yet but fits fine.
4.0,my fav color just the best one
4.0,"Nice cut. Stayed up all night and didn’t have to fuss with it. Ruffle is interesting, would have liked a tapered ruffle at the thigh, as the fabric thickness looked odd at the top. Fabric is moderate quality."
4.0,"This necklace is quite pretty! I ordered the gold and love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it appears to be a much shorter chain in the photos- laying at about the collarbone. In reality, it is much lower, falling just lower than armpit level. I'd prefer a shorter chain but it's still very pretty so I'm keeping it!"
4.0,"This was larger than I expected.  Worked fine, but it has been my experience that items either run true to size or small, and this was larger than I was expecting."
4.0,"This is actually very good quality. The problem is they sent one with a pink medical alert stamp thing instead of red. Although I’m going to wear this because of breast cancer effects, I wanted red so it would stand out more. It’s very pretty though."
4.0,This fedora hat was exactly like the picture.  Cute and festive and the lights add a nice touch.
4.0,"My new favorite accessory, but for a hand watch it does have a pretty loud ticker. I don’t really notice it too often to care."
4.0,So cute on our daughter!! The fit is good and i love the ruffle on the sleeves
4.0,"The rings are not super bendable enough to snap or break, so that’s nice. On the other hand, your fingers will turn green after wearing the ring. I guess that can be expected out of a few products but I was expecting less disappointing results from the description. But, they fit me and were cute so I don’t necessarily mind."
4.0,"Very long in length, a bit large in the waist as well.... they are comfortable and a good weight for material for both hot and cold times of the year."
4.0,"I am happy with the belt but it is a little to big.  I have a small waist (usually wear belt size small) and I have to put the belt on the tightest setting.  In doing so, the chains in the back are too long.  I'm not sure if I am going to return it yet or not."
4.0,Using for my granddaughter Halloween costume. She is going as Buster moon in Sing
4.0,"I'm usually a size 6, but the sizing chart for this denim skirt had my waist at a size 6, and my hips at a size 10, so I ordered one of each, since they offer free returns.  The 6 fit great!  It's sturdy, thick material, and very nice looking!"
4.0,I don’t love it.  It just didn’t fit me correctly.
4.0,"God quality, beautiful"
4.0,"Small for sure, appears ok quality ..we will see"
4.0,Not a bad buy.
4.0,Belts were  sz 40 I ordered 36  I am going to keep anyway they look like they are made well
4.0,I'm big but it's good
4.0,great gift for an adult Wonder woman enthusiast.
4.0,"A beautiful pair of jeans. If you have a blessed bottom, then you will need three sizes bigger."
4.0,"Fits well, good fabric, washes well."
4.0,I tried the dress on so far so good. I will be wearing this dress on a up coming vacation.
4.0,Very cute and comfy fit. Looks really cute with some leggings and boots.
4.0,Quality glasses but a little large for my face.
4.0,"I like these dresses. I think they are comfortable and lightweight for the summer. My summers are 75 to 90 F. So it isn't super hot here. The only thing you need to be careful of is the color schemes and patterns of the pictures on the website can be a little different than in reality. I bought two dresses that I thought would be different enough in color and pattern that they wouldn't look like the same dress but when I received them, they did look too much alike after all."
4.0,The dress is beautiful and not bad quality. The sleeves no matter how much I tighten them they seem to still droop a little
4.0,Tiny but I like it
4.0,"I couldn't find a feather duster anywhere, so I did here, I used it to paint my bathroom with a unique style.<br />It worked very well."
4.0,"they fit me just right, if I need to wear compression sox might as well get fun colors."
4.0,This dress isn't the best quality. It irritates my daughter's sensitive arms. I bought it as a Halloween costume and hoped it would work for Christmas. I don't know if I can get it soft enough for her. She is in a 2-3t and it fits perfectly.
4.0,"The size medium was the perfect fit (went by the size guide), as was the kimono. For the price, everything is well made and the only issue I had was the leg warmers (?) were missing the bows on the back. That’s not a huge deal, but the bows were shown in the product images."
4.0,"Love these , super well made and they come with a nice protective case"
4.0,Fits well. Good weight for running in 30s.
4.0,"I love it , I need to order some other colors"
4.0,"This slips right off my ear. I tried the top of my ear and the side of my ear (which is where I want to wear it) and it won't stay. And I wouldn't say I have particularly small/thin ears (is that even a thing?). And it's so freaking sturdy that I can't bend it. Which in theory, is great that it's so strong, but I need to pinch it together to get it to stay on. I have been unsuccessful in my attempts, and so has my husband. We will have to enlist some tools to pinch the damn thing.<br /><br />**update 4/28/14 - I used my husband's pliers to pinch it closed, and now it stays on my ear. I will change my review to 4 stars because now I wear it all the time and i love it. BUT BE PREPARED TO GET PLIERS AND PINCH IT if you buy it."
4.0,"I wish it were just a little softer, but all in all a good product"
4.0,Soft and comfortable. Fit was good
4.0,"Very attractive and comfortable, but thought the black crochet on the bodice and the black skirt overlay made the dress too dark."
4.0,Perfect! My kiddos LOVES this!
4.0,"They are everything I was hoping they would be.  Sturdy, not heavy, beautiful color."
4.0,I like the material and the length of the shorts. I would purchase them again but I would get a smaller size.
4.0,Not wild about the cut
4.0,It's a nice material however go a size up when ordering. It fits slim.
4.0,"These pins were a gift for a person in the early stages of dementia.  She has always loved cats.  Recently, I purchased dark blue pantsuit for her to wear when taken to church.  The purpose of the pins were to dress up the suit and since she used to love to read, would probably choose the pin with the cats and the books.  The pin or brooch is fastened using a fairly sharp nail-like point that put a noticeable hole in the lapel of the suit jacket. A metal cap pushed on the ""nail"" keeps it in place.  The pins are not attached using the safety pin type attachment I expected.  They are cute and did not look cheap which is the reason for 4 star rating."
4.0,Lots of beading material necessary for folding the Flag.
4.0,"Really love this leotard! So cute - only one star removed because the bow on the back is a little off center, but not enough for me to return it. Lots of compliments on it!"
4.0,Nice clip on set. I had the ones that expanded and clipped on but the tabs that hold those to your glasses become weak and snap off after time so after 2 sets of those I decided to get the squeeze clip kind and they work much better. The shape is not exactly right for my glasses but they are close enough to work just fine. These were inexpensive and nothing fancy but they work perfectly for what I need.
4.0,Nice fit . Loved the color.
4.0,This was a gift. Not really big enough for men unless very small feet.
4.0,Fits well around the waist but bunches up at the top sometimes.
4.0,"PROS: excellent quality material, soft, pairs well with many styles of tops, colors and shoes, shape and ruffled waistline look just as they are pictured! Super on trend!<br /><br />CONS: slightly large, not cobalt blue as they are pictured (they are dark navy)<br /><br />I’m 5’5” 115lbs athletic build wearing size Small. JUST BUY THEM ALREADY"
4.0,I probably could have gone a size up but it does have a little stretch
4.0,"My Specs: 5'2 - 120lbs - pants size: small, 3 or 4 (typically)<br /><br />Overall: These pants are great, I love them -  they are very comfortable and very cute! The material is almost silk-pajama-like but a tad thicker... literally only a little bit, the material is still pretty thin so if you were to sit on a metal chair you would feel the hot or cold very well. They are a mid to high waist (depending on your torso) and on me, they fall right to the top of my ankle which is the exact right length for me. There are front pockets but the back ""pockets"" are just for show, its sewn shut, and is not really a pocket. There is no zipper or button/latch closure, these are slipped on like you would leggings.<br /><br />Note about the ""stretch"": the waist on these pants has an elastic back (not the front) which is stretchy and would allow for a little give, that said the rest of the pants are not stretchy... if you have a smaller waist but a little larger hips/bottom you may want to opt for a size up because these could be tight, may not go on, or rip when you bend over (you've been warned LOL) - there just isn't much room for forgiveness in these pants, in that area.<br /><br />These pants should be washed with like colors, on a delicate/handwash cycle, and laid flat or hang dry.<br /><br />Did you find this review helpful? Please let me know!"
4.0,"These were great!! Great quality, amazing price. I was suprise at how great they looked, because of the low price, but I was not disappointed. Recommended!"
4.0,Wonderful quality dress. Casual wear. The colour is vibrant and is as in the picture.
4.0,Very beautiful only negative is the clasping area of the bracelet
4.0,looks better in picture.
4.0,I bought the purse for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived when it was suppose to and it looks very good. It is what she wanted for her Christmas present.
4.0,"I ordered a M and it was too small for my bottom half. I am 5'6"" 170lbs and wear size 11 bottom but size M top (A cup). If I would have gotten a large it would have been too big on my top half so not their fault. It was thick enough material. It technically fit but was too short and kept rolling up from the bottom. I may try to order a large and see if it works better. Looked cute though."
4.0,Beautiful dress but very thin. Wear with hose and body corset. Otherwise beautiful. I’m 5’5 128lbs. Normally wear a small but got Medium in this & glad I did . The material is really thin but it’s a beautiful dress
4.0,Super cute and look great on - my only complaint is that there is a weird glare on electronics when you are viewing screens; I assume it’s from the fading of a darker color to a lighter gray on the lens itself.
4.0,A little tight even getting the XXXL/L(US) size but i like the style and hint of color.
4.0,"The quality of this is great and it looks good. But if you're unsure, or want a snugger fit, size down!"
4.0,"The headband is tough, durable, and comfortable. It can be easily adjusted and the HeadCam locks into the clip nice and snug.<br /><br />One issue though is I wish the mount connector on the headband was different so you could adjust the camera up and down. I do have different mounts for my cam, but not one that will work with the headband as the strap on this is not as wide as a regular goggle strap."
4.0,Cute good quality but a little small for size so order a size up
4.0,"I normally wear a size 6, but have large shoulders. The black dress with red flowers is cotton, with very little stretch in the shoulders. I ordered an 8 and it is a bit lose everywhere but the shoulders were still snug, almost uncomfortable. I'm keeping it because it's super cute, but I really wish there were a bit more stretch overall.  As other reviewers have stated, be gentle with the zipper, it tends to stick"
4.0,I like that this jumpsuit is comfortable as well as stylish.  I ordered a medium after measuring and followed that in ordering.  It fits comfortably tho I find myself wondering what a small might have offered.
4.0,I have these shorts in multiple colors. Quality is good. Color is great. Fit is to be excepted. I don’t love the band on top but they still fit great.
4.0,Perfect length.  I'm 5 2. Sizing is a bit big.  I needed to pin at the chest
4.0,is as stated. no complaints
4.0,This runs big so size down but it’s cute.
4.0,Nice little keychain. Not the best quality but it should last long enough
4.0,They fit tighter then other compression socks. I suggest you go up in size.
4.0,This handbag in tropical Paradise is NOT as blue as it is in the picture. Its a turquoise color. Very well made handbag that lasts for years.
4.0,"I had been looking for a dress with this pattern for awhile now. Especially will the fall upon us. I made sure to read the other reviews and get a sense of what size I should go with. I'm 5'8, 180lbs and a medium fit perfectly! The dress is a great quality, and with the fullness of the skirt, a petticoat is definitely recommended for that extra pop. The color was as expected. Not a big fan of the belt, but that's easily remedied. The dress looks just as good without it, or if you have your own belt to pair it up with. Overall I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,"These are nice jeans, well-made and fit well.  My only complaint is that a few rhinestones came off the pockets during the first wearing.  I didn't send them back because I didn't buy them for the rhinetones but if it matters to you, beware."
4.0,Comfortable and sizing was appropriate the material is noisy like a wind breaker
4.0,"The product was fine but the 17&#34; X 35&#34; shirt would fit a linebacker.  If you're a big guy this will work.  Unfortunately, I'm not built that way so I had to return them on my own dime (lost a star) but the company is supposedly refunding my $."
4.0,"this coin purse was just the right size for my small purse, the only problem i had but fixed was there is an  i.d slot on the inside of the purse that gets caught with coins and stretches it out so i put a picture i knew would never come out and then hot glued the seam together and it fixed the problem.."
4.0,"Love this summery skirt, but material is thin.<br /><br />Also think that the price is too high."
4.0,Had a lot of great pictures on them
4.0,I love the length and fit of this product but it is a little see through. I purchased a slip to go underneath.
4.0,Great but hugs the crotch weird
4.0,I’m 5’9 150 pounds I got a large fits well just a tad bit short but still cute
4.0,"I'm 150lbs, 5'5&#34;, size 10, M/L tops. This just barely fit me. Kind of this material. Would be great with a slip or liner (or just black panties). Looks super cute with a white crop top."
4.0,I love this style of wallet. I had a similar one that broke and I searched high and low to find this style again.  It is a little larger than my last wallet but overall I love it.
4.0,Beautiful ring.  My daughter loves it.  Unfortunately the horn part is very sharp and she has pierced her skin a couple times.  Now she won’t wear it much anymore.
4.0,"Nice coat. Fit really  good. Wish it was just a little longer, but comfortable to set in car when driving. I really fell warm and dry. This coat replaces a down filled coat that was 45 years old and was looking really old."
4.0,"Great Summer &#34;Go To&#34; Dress. Very comfortable, stretchy, fit is true to size. Plus it has Pockets...bonus!"
4.0,"There were 2 pair where the stitching came completely undone in the back. They aren't the best quality and run a little small, but you get what you pay for."
4.0,"Very supportive compared to my other sport bras. I bought a size L as recommended for a 38D. (I'm 5'4&#34;, 138#). A little snug, but it gives a feeling of support. No uniboob problem. Would buy again."
4.0,The face is bigger than expected but I love it.  Another dragonfly item added to my collection. I will recommend this to one of my friends who also loves dragonfly items.
4.0,"Pretty watch, a bit large & tight fitting though"
4.0,Works great both putting it on and taking it off.
4.0,i receive my DG sunglasses today. the glasses did not look cheap and the case is brand new. i will give this four stars because the glasses is too big to fit in the case.
4.0,Great quality very thick fabric great for fall or winter too hot for spring or summer. The sleeves are very long. I recommend sizing down. Overall I recommend this product it's worth the money.
4.0,My 10yr old daughter LOVES these - and would wear them to school if I let her :)
4.0,"Oh the tic tok leggings.. they are an eye catcher.. but don’t try and work out in them. They do not wear well for that.  The could be made a little better. The dude pocket ripped day one! All that was in there was my phone.  They shunk a bit too after washing.  Soo for the money, meh. I would not buy another pair unless they were Uber cheap."
4.0,"These joggers were super cuter and the material was so comfortable. However, I didn’t keep these because the fit didn’t look good on me around my legs and knees. I’m 5’1 and have very short and thick legs so these didn’t work out for me as expected. If they did I would have totally gotten more!"
4.0,Was great to throw over swimsuit and walk around beach and resort. Dries quickly.
4.0,Fits a little to tight and wish they were a little more darkening.  Do like them and sure they will loosen up with wear.
4.0,"This watch is an good value.  I misplaced my Casio G shock and decided to purchase another cheap replacement until my G reappears.  I was disappointed when I first saw the light weight watch I had purchased. I'd say I have an average to small wrist at 7.5&#34; circumference... so if you have a large wrist this band will be too small.... However after a few days I begin to appreciate the stripped down efficacy of this $9 purchase.<br />However, the watch's face is smaller than I would like.  It almost feels like a woman's sport watch.  I just purchased a Timex T5K086 1440 Sports band and found the Timex much more suitable.  The face is much larger than the casio and definitely more suited to a man.  The ease of setting up date and time is a bit more difficult than the Casio.  But, given the instructions.. not that tough."
4.0,"Beautiful soft fleece, I love the color it’s true to the photo. Runs a little large, had to wash it in hot water and dry on high heat and now it fits snugly. Warm and perfect fleece weight. Would order again."
4.0,This is so adorable. Had to pinch it a bit to make sure it stayed in place. Thank you bunches.
4.0,I like them but they do nothing for me.
4.0,"EDIT: The vendor was quick to reach me back and offer to ship a replacement band. They were very understanding and apologetic. I will give this band another try. Great customer service.<br /><br />This is a great design wristband at first glance, but the poor screw connectors is what ruined this product. The reason that the screw connectors became loose was bc I had to disconnect and reconnect the wristband from my Gear fit 2 in order to adjust with wrist size. Over time the connectors be same loose and I almost lost my gear fit 2 bc of it. For $20 range product,  I was expecting a higher quality build than the $10 range competitor wristband. After roughly 3 months of usage the screw connectors came off the hinge completely. Honestly I'm disappointed with my purchase and wouldn't recommend this brand for future buyers."
4.0,"The shirt I received does not look like the shirt in the photo.<br />But I give it 4 stars because I actually love this top its a stretchy type material which is comfortable and the floral print is still beautiful.<br />For references I am 5'11 and ordered the XL so it would be a loose tunic style fit since I have a large bust.<br /><br />*I know how much I rely on reviews so I try to give the best detailed reviews possible, let me know if this was helpful or if you have any questions"
4.0,"Soft leggings, similar to the more expensive,online party brands. The waistband is very thin, I prefer a thicker waistband."
4.0,"Cute, made very well was a gift for sis she liked it"
4.0,Not the greatest of quality; washed once already and can see that they will not wear for more than 6 months. But in the meantime looks good for office. Stretch adds a nice touch.
4.0,Beautiful top!  The pictures don't do it justice.  I have worn it twice and have gotten many compliments.  It does run a little large which us why I did not give a 5 star rating.
4.0,"I love this one because you dont have to clear citrine so its really nice. unfortunately it came loose and i had to glue it back on, other than that its a great pendulum. thank you"
4.0,My 10 year old son loves this watch. We've ordered it twice. The first one was ruined by the swimming pool water. The second one was no longer usable after the strap broke and there was no way to repair it. We are now trying other watches.
4.0,The dark color fades a bit. Must be ironed.
4.0,purchased for a wolf lover niece.  seemed to be good quality.  she liked it.
4.0,"These adorable pajamas are lightweight and very comfortable.  Very smooth fabric (though, perhaps, not the most breathable) is very comfy and a weight particularly suitable for fall or spring.  The sheep on the pants are printed into the fabric, but the sheep on the top is actually an applique.<br />As other reviewers have noted, these run large.  I'd suggest sizing down at least one size, if available.  Or just prepared to embrace oversized comfort, because these are super cute.  (The top is also quite long; bearing in mind that I am quite short, the top does fall below my hips)."
4.0,"Gives a nice shade, but fits a bit loose, still bearable. I am 5'9.  Overall, I recommend it."
4.0,Very cute and my granddaughter loved it
4.0,"Great coat, I should have just ordered one size smaller."
4.0,Cute dress just runs a bit small. Once I lose a little weight it’ll be perfect though! Foot material too.
4.0,"Cute shirt, color is super xactly like the picture. Didn’t know the style was fitted. It’s a stretchy material but not loose. Order up if you want it baggy."
4.0,"I love this dress, but I wish it was full length. I am 5’10” and it is tea length at best. I would have given this 5 stars had it been full length. I do love the dress otherwise."
4.0,It's beautiful love it so far
4.0,"I'm giving this item  only 4 stars, since I had to go through the hassle of re-ordering. The first time I ordered a size 42L, I was sent a size 44L. But, when my second order of a size 42L arrived, it fit perfectly! Nice jacket! Just wish the original order had been sent correctly."
4.0,I get compliments from people when I wear them.  I like them very much.
4.0,Size up if you have hips. Straps were too long for me (not adjustable) but will sew them into a racerback after I receive the size up.
4.0,"I bought it for my son for his birthday.  My husband said it was too lightweight,  but my son LOVES it.  For the price,  my teen son and I are very happy."
4.0,Very comfortable for lake and around the house
4.0,"The dress isn't as rich a red color as in the Amazon photos on my laptop and desktop. It's a medium red, bordering on orange. The length wasn't as advertised. One dress was longer than advertised, another was shorter than advertised. The bodice on my 10 year old's dress was so stiff that it chafed her arms near the armpits. I had to machine sew the fabric downward near the armpits so she could wear it for my wedding.<br /><br />The style is nice and elegant. Both girls loved the dresses. I welcomed the change from the princess styles that dominate most stores today. Both girls wore heels (to compensate for off lengths) and loved dancing in them because of the full length. The shoulders draped over one daughter's shoulders but kept falling off my younger daughter's shoulders.<br /><br />Warning to buyers: this fabric snags. It gets snagged on everything. Before we even made it to the ceremony, I had to pull three snags out of one dress.<br /><br />I'd buy the dress again because the style isn't easy to find and it complemented my wedding dress well. I'd give myself extra time before the event to make alterations or take it to a shop to have the dress amended properly for a comfortable fit."
4.0,"Very cute, too short to be a dress for me at 5'8"". Cute with leggings or shorts."
4.0,This is a good product.
4.0,it looks like in the picture its pretty and very soft. i thought it will be too large but it fit me very well
4.0,Time will tell as to how the finish holds up.
4.0,Very comfortable and movable. If I wear this type for too many days in a row they start to rub at the leg holes but I alternate with some cotton panties and love that :)
4.0,For the price it is a great replica.
4.0,"The fit was generous for my 6yo who wears a 10 normally.  The red stripe was more of an orange after the first wash, but they look great on him, so no complaints...just wish they were red and not a grapefruit red."
4.0,"It seems really small when I opened the package but when I tried it on it was perfect. I would have liked one size up because I like to eat and drink and be comfy on the  Holidays (which I am planning to were these). I am 5  Overall, for the price it's a great dress up or dress down sexy pants. Very petite in length and size. I haven't worn it so I don't know how it will wash and the overall quality."
4.0,"I reside in Florida and ordered these boots (size 8.5) for a December trip to Germany. These shoes were comfortable from Day 1 with thick wool socks (1 pair only) and, for the most part, kept my feet warm and dry. The temperatures I experienced while touring Germany ranged from highs in the 50s to below zero at the peak of The Zugspitze (shy of 10,000'). I walked in these boots every day in damp, wet and snowy conditions...in the cities, climbing castle steps, browsing Christmas markets, etc. If I permanently resided in a colder climate, I would probably invest in a fully water-proof and warmer shoe, but these boots certainly satisfied my immediate need and were a wise investment. I do recommend them depending on one's usual climate conditions."
4.0,"The Balaclava Mutlipurpose Face Mask was purchased originally for my husband to use in the cold to hunt in.  My husband has dread locks that are very long.  Because of this the Face Mask would not cover his hair, head, and face properly.  WE didn't want such a durable item to go to waste so we brained stormed and decided to give it to my asthmatic daughter.  The weather has gotten colder where we live so this was the perfect solution.  She has worn it every morning to wait for the bus.  She said she can breathe thru it not problems and it covers up her ears while keeping her warm.  This face mask is a great item to have if you live in cold weather or do outdoor things.  The material is breathable and soft.  It has some give also.  I received this face mask at a reduced rated for an unbiased and honest opinion."
4.0,"Make sure you notice - these are pajama shirts.  They are fine, but not fitted and shorter than typical t-shirts."
4.0,no lining in top but otherwise it is great
4.0,Purse is exactly as described. Very happy with it Also
4.0,"This was exactly as advertised, but it is a LOT bigger than I expected. It's like the size of a walnut. It's just something to keep in mind when you imagine it on the person who you expect to be wearing it."
4.0,Good shoe. Need to break it in more.  Fits as expected.
4.0,A little on the cheap side but they are still cute.
4.0,"It's very stretchy, which could be a plus or a minus depending on what you were looking for. They fit nicely and they aren't restrictive but I felt that they weren't good for tucking shirts into, since they were so stretchy."
4.0,It is very comfy and easy to clean
4.0,Affordable but not as good as some expensive ones. I run marathon. This is useful for my recovery and training. Used many pairs of different brands. These are not bad.
4.0,These are great. Very soft. They fit well except they are way too long. I am 5’5 so not terribly short and these I have to fold up so they are not bunches at the ankle. Other than that I love them.
4.0,This cheese hat is amazing basically for packer fans. I like top hats and the cheese wedge known as classic packer fans wear. I did knock off a star due to two issues the one it is a bit heavy but won’t put a strain on your neck it would be a great outdoor hat considering it doesn’t have pin holes to make it breathable but I would totally put this in your packer game day collection
4.0,"Love this! The only reason for the 4/5 is the bottom layer needs a button so it stays in place, otherwise I love it!"
4.0,Recieved on time. I like how it has the black buckle. I don’t think it’s made by Luminox and I think this band might last longer. It feels thicker than the original Luminox band. The Luminox bands start to crack and split after use. I do a lot of outdoor activities with the watch.
4.0,I like very good products.
4.0,Lovely necklace is.
4.0,"Great color, fit well!"
4.0,"Can't beat the price, the quality is just below what I have chosen in the past but I am overall happy with the product to date.  Have only worn 2 pair, waist band rolls but that could just be my body type.  The fabric is a bit thin but comfortable. Best part, the printed label is in white, extra large type all the way across the inside back waist band, not very sexy!  But funny!"
4.0,"They work decent, pretty bulky but they were good for back in 2011"
4.0,"Very nice pins and perfect for the price.<br />They are exactly as described, colors matched the pictures perfectly too.<br />I find the spring mechanism a little weak, at times my ties somehow get out of the clips' grip.<br />With more expensive and so better made clips I have not experienced this.<br />These clips still have the best value to quality ratio!"
4.0,"I got these for Christmas. I'm 5'7&#34; and they are slightly long and a little baggier than I thought, but that's probably good because they are cotton and I bet they will shrink over time. I would recommend these to someone and I would probably buy them again."
4.0,These stockings are very comfortable except behind my knees. I even tried a larger size but they still pinch and bind at knees.
4.0,"These were perfect for the personalized keychains I made! Easy to put together, and everyone loved them. One star off because one was dropped and the cover fell off easily, even though it was snapped in correctly."
4.0,"All of these items will come with your GoPro in the box, but if you happen to need more parts or loose them then this is the item for you!<br />A great item to get if you are getting someone else a GoPro or that person already has one and... Birthday or Christmas gift idea!<br /><br />Good item tether is a little weak though."
4.0,I bought the red ( more of a burgundy) and the silver.  Both very attractive but made to fit once around the wrist so really not as easy to fit smaller or larger wrists.
4.0,Runs very small and clings so tight it's not very flattering.  Very comfy material though.
4.0,Loved them for the price great value
4.0,Good product. As described. Fast shipping.
4.0,"The crotch is s little low for my taste, but I still like the pants"
4.0,"Love the jeans, will order one size smaller next time."
4.0,Ok product. But they are tough to get in.<br />Highly suggest having a professional help get these in if using for a &#34;Daith plug&#34;
4.0,"Great socks, very good quality for the cheap price. Comfortable for a men's size 11 foot."
4.0,granddaughter likes it
4.0,"Material is ok, not double stitched.  Desperately needs pockets or separators on the inside."
4.0,Sooo feminine and country looking.
4.0,"This is a casual little lightweight skirt that’s perfect for travel and vacations.  It’s casual for daytime wear but can look flirty at the disco at night.  It’s very lightweight, can be rinsed out in the sink and hung to quickly dry.  It rolls into a tiny footprint in your luggage or carry on.  Great choice."
4.0,"This was perfect for the wedding I went to, I appreciate the weight as it's warmer for cooler events. Like most review, I agree it is lowcut, I attached a piece of lace and it looks much better. The earrings aren't really my style, but I can easily give them to a girlfriend."
4.0,Very sturdy and well insulated. I like how nicely they fold flat. My only concern is the zipper is kind of hard to pull around the corners... I'm hoping the zipper doesn't break or tear. Time will tell. If the bags hold up and zippers don't rip I'll change rating to 5 stars.
4.0,great grand daugther loved
4.0,"Mine has a 1/4"" gap where the stitching missed connecting the ""mask"" part with the bottom billowy part. It doesn't affect anything. I sewed on a snap to connect the far points of the drapey part behind my neck, so it can hang around my neck while not wearing the mask. Works great."
4.0,Great fit super price they look great
4.0,These are composite toe (like steel toe) and they are fairly heavy. Other than that these are nice looking shoes. I would have kept them but I don't need composite toe shoes in my line of work.
4.0,"Great little nightshirt,  soft cotton, good length, pretty colors (I ordered the blue).  Happy 😃."
4.0,It's really nice but John deere does run on the small side. Other then that we love it.
4.0,"They felt a little small, creating pressure around my temples. Overall great pair of extremely dark locs at a decent price."
4.0,Very acceptable quality and looks but it didn't fit my specific watch (Wenger #7087X/T) so I had to return it. Return was quick and easy
4.0,If I hadn't ordered an xlarge instead of a medium it would have been way too tight. Length was good. It is slightly see through. I returned mine but it had nothing to do with the skirt itself.
4.0,"Needed to replace the clasp on a VS bralette. These are maybe 1cm bigger than the VS ones, meaning  you would have to replace both sides, and not just the one that's broken."
4.0,"Love the quality of the shirt! However, the description said the sizing ran small so I went up a size. When I got the shirt, it was really really big. I wish I would've bought my normal size. It's pretty funny and comfy though!"
4.0,Bought this for my daughter.  She wears it often.
4.0,"Slightly smaller than expected, but still great.  I think that overall these will work well for their intended purpose.  Shipped in quality bag for storage.  Thanks!"
4.0,I wanted a packable jacket to keep in my suitcase or carry on. It needed to be water repellant but not neccesarily lined as I have other jackets for traveling that are lined. This had multiple pockets and it can roll into one of the pockets for packing. I found that it is thin enough that folded into fourths it lays flat in my carry on bag that I can have a raincoat all the time. The fit was about the nirm for when I order jackets.
4.0,"This product is great for a small trip. I did not give the product 5 stars because I personally feel it should be deeper to accommodate more than a few outfits. I ordered the product for an upcoming trip and wanted to use these to separate mine and my husbands clothing and toiletries. These worked perfectly for the toiletries, however I was not able to use them for our clothing. If they were deeper they would have fit more. While it did work perfectly for toiletries the material has nothing to keep the form so everything jumbles together at the bottom. They would be better if there was some sturdiness to keep things in place. I did receive a promotional code for my unbiased opinion."
4.0,It’s runs a little large. But it’s very lightweight fabric. I’m using mine as a cover up.
4.0,"Very thin material , more like a stocking rather than a sock ."
4.0,nice looking and work well. Inexpensive enough to leave a pair in each car and boat. Going to order more
4.0,"I wanted these to work so bad because the fabric, cut and buttons were so cute but they just didn't. if I had a slimmer waist they would've been perfect."
4.0,"Very pretty. Bought them to match a pendant, &amp; they look pretty together."
4.0,Nice dress.  I am going to give this one as a gift to someone.  I will re-order. By the material already and make of the dress the top portion is already snug so I will order a larger size to compensate because I will need to wear something under the dress as well
4.0,It feels great wearing this product. I have less pain on my calf.
4.0,"Nice shirt, wife liked it a lot!"
4.0,"This scarf is very pretty and warm. I know that the size is listed but i thought It would be a little larger as the image makes it look more full and able to be wrapped around your neck twice and still have room for ends, which is not possible even on a child."
4.0,"Looks as pictured from the front, just wish the back looked like the front"
4.0,"a little bigger than expected. also thought there was a zip up pocket but it really isn't a pocket, half of it is open on the other side"
4.0,Very pretty though it shipped to me with a large center stone missing.  I had a replacement stone bead that was about the right size.  I also found it to be too small so I found another purpose for it.
4.0,"I ordered these thinking they would keep me nice and warm in the winter. They are nicely lined for sure. But my pair was just way too large, and I'm petite so they were also too long. I feel like they look more like tights versus leggings, with so much seam showing. Personally, these won't work for me."
4.0,"I really wanted this bra to work for me - it was EXACTLY the shape and style I was searching for in a sports bra - lightly padded with underwire, good support and flattering, without flattening me out or giving me the dreaded uni-boob look.  I purchased this in a 38D (I wear a 38D, 38DD or 40D, depending on brand).  Unfortunately, it was just too small to be comfortable - a 40D would have fit me perfectly.  Alas - this particular style isn't made in that size, to my chagrin.  I'm returning it because I have free returns through my Prime membership, but given that I am in the midst of a significant weight loss, am hopeful that I will be able to fit into the 38D within a few months, at which point I will re-order it."
4.0,Wasn't crazy about the fabric ( it was as described though) but it was well made and the printing on it was excellent.  I like the filter pocket as well.
4.0,"I really like this dress. The color is deep and vibrant. Material is very comfortable and similar to a soft modal. However, it’s a little big in the bust and it’s extremely long. I’ll be having it hemmed because I really like it. Best part- IT HAS POCKETS!"
4.0,Please help I am stuck in the outfit I have been stuck in it for two weeks with no one to help me bc I’m quarantined how do I get out of this
4.0,Gave them as a gift and he said he loved them.
4.0,Fit and feels good.
4.0,So unfortunately they did not fit my nostril pricing that I was intending to use it for. My nose is an 18 gage so I can only assume these are a 14 gage. But beside that they are exactly as shown.
4.0,I did not know this dress had pockets. I love pockets but the stitching is a bit off and one of the pockets doesn't lay as flat. I also had to wear a black tee under because it was pretty lowcut. I still like the dress and my boyfriend loved it on me.
4.0,The wrap worked well but it didn't stay cool for very long. I was not able to put the wrap in ice water so I would like to try it again with the water being colder to see if that makes a difference or not
4.0,"Waist and bottom fit perfect, bust was too big. Very nice look"
4.0,"Love these sunglasses, but they scratch easily."
4.0,"A little longer than expected but they get the job done, very helpful and comfy"
4.0,"Me encsnto, muy comodos"
4.0,I love this dress but it is little small
4.0,"Pretty. Wish it wasn’t so shiny and more of a semi-sheer chiffon type fabric but overall, it’s a nice blouse and fun for the summer or spring. I live in a tropical climate so I can wear year round. If it wasn’t so shiny I’d have given this 5 stars -I’d still order again!"
4.0,Small on top
4.0,"Runs big, I love the shirt but I ordered a XL I prob could have ordered a Med."
4.0,nice nice comfortable for top half
4.0,"Bought these pajamas for grand daughter. Good fit for pajamas, nice color, top and bottom matched well. Looked very nice on her."
4.0,"It's cute but I've only had it for a week at most & the chain broke!! However the seller contacted me shortly after I posted my review initially & sent me a free replacement of the chain! Awesome product & great seller for their good customer service, much appreciated!"
4.0,I bought this for my daughter - fit to size.  She said it's a very quiet boot as you walk - unlike the clank of regular boots with different soles.
4.0,"Cute, but doesn't really work well as a bathing suit if you intend to go into the water ... the legs are too wide and the top somewhat think and loose. But really cute."
4.0,Cute for our son
4.0,Got this as part of a baby shower gift.  The Mom was delighted.
4.0,I love the organization and the look. It's also a great material that cleans off easily.
4.0,Cute and unique fabric.  I get lots of compliments on this.  It does run small.  I had to return a medium and order up.
4.0,Would recommend.<br />Very nice and feminine
4.0,You would think it had more flare.  Its a pretty dress but it is not like the picture
4.0,"Solid necklace, but it’s very bulky and you might look a little like a tool."
4.0,"These are darn decent boots, but I think they are overpriced for what they are. They are very similar to some popular generic boots sold at a that certain supercenter, but they're almost 10 dollars more expensive. The color selection is wonderful though. I heeded the other reviews saying these run small, and ordered with that in mind, and they fit my children the way I wanted them to. I believe they run small by a full size."
4.0,Cute but fits pretty snuggly.
4.0,"i was afraid the legs would be too loose, but they're neither too loose nor too tight!  very comfortable."
4.0,"Great sun protection, fits great just a little  bigger than expected. Came with a bag carrier."
4.0,Smaller than it appears on photo. Definitely overpriced but still super cute!
4.0,"So overall, it's very cute and fairly comfortably but if you have a larger bust, those cups sewn into the chest are tiny as heck. I ordered a size 16 and while it does fit well everywhere else and is fairly stretchy, the cups are far too small for my chest.<br /><br />Edit: the more I wear it the comfier it is, I wish they had half star ratings. I like this dress a lot."
4.0,Awesome bag. I was able to fit my lap top and purse in it. The only con I might add is that the canvas gets dirty very quickly.
4.0,Arrived in good condition. A well made pendulum. I do recommend.
4.0,"When I took these camisoles/work-out tank tops out of the package I first noticed how soft these tops are; after inspection of my tops the stitching seems secure. I’m please with how soft these are while I’m wearing the tank top(s), afar as compression “eh” definitely middle rate a 5/10 ."
4.0,Top was a little bit big on my 12 year old. But bottoms fit good.
4.0,"No instructions for charging, we dont know how to do it."
4.0,"Good price, deep discount. I am using it for an indoor range."
4.0,"High quality nylon belt with a really unique and strong clasp/buckle. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the process of feeding the buckle through belt loops can be difficult and annoying.  But at $21 for 3 premium tactical belts, this purchase is a ""no brainer"". The belts are definitely worth the money and they look pretty cool too!"
4.0,I love these so much but I don't recommend for work. I use them daily but got a hole in the finger after a month.
4.0,"Like it very much.  It's just a long sleeve tee and I just wanted to have something to hang around the house in.  After showing it to my husband, he gave me his viewpoint which was...You could go out in that!!!  LOL.  That's a man for you!!!  I might use it with my yoga pants for yoga class."
4.0,"If you want to look taller, It's a very good product, but I have expected it to be softer than what they are actually are."
4.0,A little on the small side. It’s a very snug fit.
4.0,"I received the necklace I ordered for my mom who recently lost her pet Chihuahua. I am happy with my purchase, I gave the product 4 stars and not 5, because on the front of the dog there is some tiny bubbling in the metal. Other than that... I'm glad with my purchase."
4.0,True fit. I am 5’2 so the sleeves were a little long. But overall great shirt for the fall or winter.
4.0,After three weeks of use the clamshell clasp turn dingy and don’t hold the shinny look. That’s my only complaint.
4.0,I like that it fits well and other charms can go on it.
4.0,Very nice nothing elaborate and received within a decent amount of shipping time
4.0,"Todavía no lo he usado pero parece de buena calidad. Lo unico negativo es que hace ruidos con  la tela cuando te mueves, y que me quedó grande porque pedí un xl cuando mi talla L , ""Por estar mirando algunos comentarios"". El abrigo es fiel a la talla."
4.0,"Fits great, breaths well, flattering to body. Makes me want to get a bigger chest, haha!"
4.0,"These shoes run small.  I wear a 6 1/2 - 7, so I bought the 7.  Too small so I sent them back and got the 7 1/2.  They fit okay, but definitely get  the bigger size if you are ordering."
4.0,"I would still recommend this ring even though it does run about one half size too small. It goes quite well with some of my other fancy rings so, all in all, not bad."
4.0,Descent quality far the price.
4.0,Great pants....jus order a size up from ur usual!
4.0,"My daughter loves these mittens. They are a thinner material, so they are not super warm, but I figured that by the way the fabric looked. I bought them because my daughter really wanted fingerless mittens and they were super cute. Arrive just as shown and fit an 8 year old well."
4.0,"I work in IT and have 5 metal flashdrives on this keychain. I hook it into my belt loop every morning and frequently remove it and replace it when working. I haven't had any issues with the latch or pin like others have stated. The latch itself is not &#34;difficult&#34; to push like some other people have said. The finish shows normal wear around the hard edges.<br /><br />Some people have said that this keychain is too &#34;small&#34;, but I find it to be the perfect size. If it were any bigger, I wouldn't want to carry it on my person.<br /><br />Overall, extremely pleased with this purchase and will be looking at other Jzcky Shzrp products again when I'm in the market for another keychain!"
4.0,Nice - good quality -but....t torso too short !!  I'm 5'6&#34; 123lbs and pads came 2&#34; below where they should be.
4.0,"Good quality for the price, fabric feels nice. One complaint its very silky so it would frequently get loose and you have to tie it back"
4.0,These are truly 14K my ears won't tolerate anything else.  They are good looking but I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because I have not figured out how to put a dangling bead on the open ring.  I guess I don't understand how it works because the bottom ring you would put the bead on is not open.  They are a bit smaller then expected for the money.  I do like the lever back so I don't have to worry about losing them.
4.0,I say fit as expected but I am 5'1&#34; and the length fit nicely. Taller women may not agree.
4.0,The quality is not that great but for the price it looks really good on just right for my event
4.0,very sporty..nice fit!!
4.0,"It's cheap, but it's sweet. It's going to be my kids Christmas present to their Mimi."
4.0,These have a rainbow printed number on the side that it DOES NOT SHOW IN PICTURES.
4.0,"LOVE the material. Ordered a size up from what I normally wear, and its still a little snug. Beauty is pain."
4.0,ok...kinda small
4.0,"I’m 5’1” - about 142-145 pounds. I ordered a large and if I had gone any smaller or larger, I don’t think it would’ve fit. The sleeves are a little bit too long but not enough to make me want to return it. The dress is very form fitting as well. But it’s adorable! I can’t wait to use it for my engagement photos and if not that, Christmas parties!"
4.0,I really like this shirt. Very cozy. I think it runs slightly small in my opinion- I always want my sleep shirts to be loser.
4.0,Not expensive.
4.0,Smaller than expected but still good quality
4.0,Good quality eyewear. very comfortable to wear. Delivered on time. would buy again.
4.0,"I love the beret, but it arrived with the beret fuzz balls on there and I have to remove it. I love the color, but the felt material looks a bit thin. However, the hats needs some washing instructions. I hand wash this blue beret and the color started to fade."
4.0,"Nice pajama for a little boy, he loved it"
4.0,"I do like them, they fit over well  but they slightly blur my vision. I do have a very strong prescription."
4.0,I am a small woman and these gloves are a TIGHT fit.  I have difficulty getting them on.  Once on they are warm and I am able to use my cell phone.
4.0,"The lenses themselves look more blue than green than the pictures indicate. There's some green to them, but they're mostly blue with some green reflections instead of the other way around. Seems to be of decent quality."
4.0,These are really lovely. I bought them as a gift and my friend loved them.  Not too  big or long. Might have to get a pair for myself.
4.0,"This is really a cute design idea that was much appreciated by a 16-year-old family member who chose it for a gift.  I can see how it would be cute with a little bit of puff underneath it to display the skirt, but it was also cute just as is.  My reason for giving it only 4 stars was that the fabric was really thin and the placement of the notes on the fabric at the top of the dress was obviously not placed where the notes would have been the most attractive."
4.0,"I love how this bonnet is very snug around my hairline. It's also very long enough for my long, luxurious, braids or locs."
4.0,Colors are as shown in the pictures. pretty! There are 2 layer of fabric with NO option to put filter in-between. They fit my face well but i feel they will be loose for a small/petite face. The only reason i am taking out a star is bcoz they look soooo long to get delivered.
4.0,"As most others have said, the bottoms are very low cut with very little coverage. Top is worth every penny"
4.0,I am happy with my purchase.  It is fairly sturdy. This is a very nice product especially for the price paid.
4.0,It looks like the picture.  It doesn't seem like it will last a long time.
4.0,"It's a really nice case just very thin plastic. I love it though..... Very slim, fits like a glove, super chic.... It's really pretty"
4.0,"They're a good, quality shoe!  They're very unique :)"
4.0,"It's a nice heavy chain, waiting for vacation to wear it longer."
4.0,"I really like this shirt, but it is a bit snug. Looks great though!"
4.0,"Great organizer, I just wish it was a tad bit larger!"
4.0,"It looks nice and seems to work fine. It shipped from China, comes without instructions, and is hard to read due to small, faint lettering; fortunately, I have a small magnifier also on a keychain, so I keep them together!"
4.0,Very heavy but also very pretty.
4.0,"The glowing eyes are a head turner. Standard Halloween costume quality, scythe broke by the end of the day, but that’s really my expectation with these kind of costumes."
4.0,I received this and it is a beautiful bag.  Love the color and style.  It is not authentic Coach but definitely worth the price.
4.0,Tight in the shoulders. I'll probably order one size larger next time. Feels nice.
4.0,Don’t know I gave it for a gift
4.0,These sunglasses were delivered a week early for me. They are nice for cheap sunglasses. I like the style.
4.0,Nice all around sweatshirt
4.0,"Very good quality, it stretches well. I was able to fit an xl. And I’m 230lbs"
4.0,Earrings looked very nice on me.  I liked them.  I wish you have them in 14K.
4.0,"I've purchased 90 Degree by Reflex leggings from T.J. Maxx before (a year or two ago), but the quality of these is much nicer! The heather is a thicker fabric than either of my printed TJM finds are, and they're more supportive. I wear these strictly for workouts, and they're great for that. They work well for yoga, running, and weightlifting, and I don't find myself hitching them up as often as I do my older, thinner ones. I gave then four stars instead of five, because they're not quite as nice as soft/thick as the one premium brand I prefer, but they're otherwise great, and are much less expensive. Well-constructed, with even, non-irritating seams. For the discounted Amazon price, they're a total steal.<br /><br />I'm 5'2&#34; and don't find the 22&#34; inseam to be an issue for me. It was clearly listed in the product description, and I know where 22&#34; hits on my frame, so I was prepared for it. It hit where I expected it to. I like the slightly-longer capri length for winter running.<br /><br />These fit a little generously, but not super-large. I'm usually an xs or s in workout pants, and I needed the xs for these."
4.0,"Great fit , easy to apply"
4.0,I was disappointed that it was not true to size.
4.0,"It is the perfect costume to last a year of activities and festivals with my daughters. It fit to size, I wear a size 8 pants and normally a medium top and it fit perfect. The belt is kind of annoying it won’t stay in the loop, so I did use a safety pin to keep it from dangling down"
4.0,Perfect shirt if you don’t own pets. If you own pets you better buy this shirt it’s own personal bubble. It collects any and all hair that it gets washed with or is near. Staticy material. Other than that it’s super comfy and looks nice.
4.0,They just fit love the color and fabric. Pretty warm.
4.0,"This was way to small to hold in all the junk on my chest,  I measured and thought I measured and order accordingly.  However this was not correct.  I could not mash enough to get this to even close.<br />The material is soft, zipper seems to be stable not sure about comfort as I could only get 1/4 of my chest inside this bra.<br />Overall I am not happy or displeased with this bra, I should have paid a bit more attention next time I will add like 10 to my measurements to  make sure things fit me.<br />I received a discount for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by trying to wear this bra myself."
4.0,"I would have 5 starred it but I would like it better for 2 changes:<br />* A hook and eye or some kind of fastening and opening in the back of the bra portion to fasten it before you swing it around to wear. Pull over stuff like this wears me out. :/ I am in the process of sewing in my idea and it should work out well.<br /><br />* The stretch band bottom of the top is too strong. Like it better if it just sat on the hip but it is so tight it gets hot under there.<br />I love the fit. The pants are very comfortable, the top is fun cuz you can pull it up to sun your belly. Also in the process of somehow opening the bottom to flow more."
4.0,Really nice and just as described but it is a little thicker and will take some “breaking in” to let it lie like a necklace.
4.0,Very cute but the unicorn peeled off after the third time my daughter wore it. :(
4.0,Great for everyday use at home
4.0,Really sexy skirt.  The whole skirt is made of a spandex material that looks like denim but fits like a bodycon skirt.
4.0,"Excellent waterproof material, fits lots of stuff. I like the magnetic closures."
4.0,Very cute and quality better than expected
4.0,Very nice fitting boot. Attractive and functional.
4.0,I made the mistake and had a M frame it fits but doesn’t stay on well. The clarity of lens is excellent the polarization is outstanding
4.0,smaller than thought but will work
4.0,No padding in the top so it made my boobs look weird but otherwise it was okay.
4.0,"The watches with engraving were delivered very quickly. Their classy look belies the reasonable price. I would have given it 5 stars, but I was disappointed with the quality of the wood box. Then again, it's the watch that is most important, and they do keep time accurately."
4.0,"I love this, hand wash because the lace on sleeves tightens up when dried"
4.0,Cut outfit but the net part rolls up.
4.0,Very thin silky material. Won’t keep you very warm but  my son loves it:)) fits smaller than a normal large. I’d size up.
4.0,CUte
4.0,Nice watch. It was too big for my wrist so I took 5 links out. Other than that the a nice looking watch
4.0,"When I placed the order for this product I was taking a gamble as there weren't many reviews however I am very pleasantly surprised by the quality, the fit and how gorgeous it looks. I am pretty tone from the front but my back needs more working out and it does fit my a tad more tightly than i would have personally liked, but its so pretty that i didnt want to bother with returning it."
4.0,Good looking Bathing suit.
4.0,"I needed to replace my sunglasses with a metallic frame because of a metal allergy and I didn't want to commit yet to an expensive new pair. I am very pleased with the Caxman, they do their job of protecting from the sun, the plastic is not the most durable quality but the case is very sturdy better than the ray ban case. I would recommend  these sunglasses if you want the rayban style without the price."
4.0,"I took a bit of a chance when I ordered this necklace as it's not something that I would normally wear. I've always been more comfortable wearing pendant style necklaces, and this one was a little bit grand. It is a beautiful necklace, but unfortunately I don't have much in my closet that I can quite make this work with. The yellows and ambers, maroons and reds are very earthy, almost autumn colors. They don't lend to a spring or summer wardrobe very effectively. The necklace length is about right, but a little long. In the picture you can see one of the strands that hangs a little lower, and that is precisely what I received. I've actually adjusted that strand to not droop, which, I imagine, is probably going to ruin the look of it, but it makes me feel better. The gold necklace is more antique brassy than a true gold. I believe the whole necklace was designed to have a retro look to it, and it achieves a quite nicely. The beads are nicely designed, and the variety is well-balanced. Like I said, this is a necklace more designed for a fall winter wardrobe and for somebody who doesn't mind making a bit of a statement. I received this product at a discount for my fair and honest review, and in no way has this influenced my review of this necklace."
4.0,"Love the loose fit but I think the XXL was a little to big for me. I will still wear it, but I did by an XL in white which fits much better."
4.0,"I was looking for a light green dress and this one looked green, but it reads turquoise.  I took a chance and indeed, the color is just like the picture.  It was a little snug at first in the arms area, (since I have pretty muscular arms.)  I cut the material off as close to the seamline as I could and it fits much better.  The lining on the breast line shows a little and maybe it can lay down more flatly if pressed.  Otherwise it is a great purchase and a nice looking dress:)"
4.0,"Place under a light for a few mins before putting them in your shoes, if not it will not glue. Definitely has it’s moments where it glows great and at other times it doesn’t. Can’t beat it for the price"
4.0,"These earrings are definitely statement pieces. They are very eye catching, the feathers are especially nice and pretty. They are long, about 5 1/4"" for the silver tone ones and 5 1/2"" for the gold tones.<br /><br />The issue I have with these is that I have reactions to anything not solid gold or silver. I'm not sure what they are made of, but my ears started itching after about 3 seconds of wearing them."
4.0,They are cute but the lens were large. So they sat on my cheeks. Bummed.
4.0,Nice just cut a bit too small for me so unfortunately had to return
4.0,it is perfect for what I need
4.0,"Pretty, well made but don’t count on them for much warmth."
4.0,"This is the second time I’ve ordered these for my son.  He call them his ‘ho-hos’.  He’s 5, but he had had a similar pair since he was a year old.  His sister wears the smaller ones and they love to match.  This pair was super soft, and a great fit.  My one caution would to be to wash before wearing.  My son was so excited to get new ones that he put them on right away and wore them to bed.  Now his sheets have a pink tint where he was sleeping.  Over all, we love them and will buy them again when he outgrows them."
4.0,"Bought these for my nephew, he loved them, and they are well-made."
4.0,"I got this for my wife, and here's our combined take:<br /><br />Looks nice, and is comfortable. Is very clingy (you may view this as a positive or a negative, depending on your preferred sartorial norms, though I think it makes the result more flattering overall). Seems to be decent fabric and assembly, though it's geared more toward a casual day out than something formal or overly, err... 'Dressy'. Excellent value for the price.<br /><br />If you like the look of the pictures, you'll probably like the end result (unless you find clingy outfits off-putting and the fit\feel came as a surprise). At the price point, there's no reason NOT to give it a go."
4.0,Love these and how they fit. But delivery time was too long.
4.0,Love the color of this dress. It is really pretty on. I am going to San Diego and will wear to a banquet.
4.0,Product fit
4.0,Love the idea of coming to friends house and don't have to be bare feet. I carry this with me everywhere I go. It protects my feet from dirty floors and cold floors when visiting friends. No more dirty feet or socks in my going home shoes :)
4.0,"These are really cute little earrings, and my wife does like them.<br /><br />The one little issue that we saw was the hinges are very loose so you have to be careful in the lining them after you put them on. Also one comes apart very easily which I was able to tighten the post up for on enough and the other one is very hard to pull apart, but after adjusting the post it wouldn't snap so I had to put it back to the more difficult position to get apart.<br /><br />I would say these are definitely a minimalist almost huggy style, but the geometric design makes them look very nice."
4.0,The band needs to be bigger. I will be looking online to see if I can find a link for this watch to make it fit better. Thank you very much the product looks very good
4.0,"fit my wifes' watch perfectly.  Since it is gold tone, only time will tell as far as color."
4.0,"Its roomy, nice summer bag.  I wish the beads would stay put, they travel the length of the handle."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7040605e63c091adc556381f5f1e174e]] Fits like a glove, and makes me feel awesome. I get complimented on it every where I go.<br />Downside is that it is cheap, I don't wash it every time I wear it(maybe 3 times washed) and the fabric is pilling up. A little see through. I wear black shorts under it so it looks more purposeful.  I definitely got my monies worth and will probably wear it a few more times before I part with it."
4.0,"Very nice pj, it is sort and light.  It is a bit more fitting at the arm, neck, bust then I expected. However I still would order your regular size."
4.0,"Fit is as expected. Length is a little shorter than was anticipating, and neckline slightly higher/more narrow than expected. But overall nice comfy shirt."
4.0,"The lace is OK. Not the best but it looks good. It's an elegant dress. The sleeves weren't too open and it complimented the dress. I ended up returning it because I bought white and it was see through. I didn't want to spend more money to buy a slip.  The length is perfect and it hit at my knee. The body wasn't tight, a little loose but not enough to look like the dress didn't fit."
4.0,"Nice fit, washes well, comfortable and good price."
4.0,I liked the fit when I first put them on but then they stretched out and got too big.. The waist fits really well so if I bought a size smaller it would have been too  small in the waist.. beautiful bling and price.
4.0,"I don't normally do reviews but this is one product that I had to give feedback on. I originally gave this a 1 star because the socks I received were not even the length of my fingers. They would not fit on my size 9 foot. I attempted to return the product but it would not allow me.<br />After leaving a poor review, the company contacted me saying they would refund me and send me a new pair of socks. The new pair of socks I received fit amazing and do not slide. You cannot see them when I wear shoes. I still only gave them a 4 star because of the inconvenience it caused me. Overall, good product if you receive the correct product."
4.0,The boy who received these loved them but we did have to get a size larger than he was wearing in other brand of pajamas.  Good to work with though.
4.0,"If you can't, or dont want to make your own, this mask is a great alternative. Its durable, light, and has addons that make it comfortable to wear. If you're wearing it over a morph suit, you may have to cut the black eye mesh off. Otherwise, it's perfect."
4.0,Nice pair of elbow length gloves.  They definitely serve their purpose.
4.0,"Really liking this jacket, the material is pleasant and I like that the hood is deep. The buttons could be fastened better, and the hoodie strings are useless, along the metal bracketing that is on the end of them. Easy fix just to remove the string all together. Over all the jacket is exactly what I expected from reading the other reviews. Totally worth the money spent, and it was delivered within 9 days of ordering product."
4.0,"When I work on the computer, my hands and wrists get cold. These gloves are very light weight, but help to hold your body heat on the hands and wrists. I have very short fingers, and these are only slightly too long. They do not interfere much at all."
4.0,"Product needs wider, better gripping, gripper material. All in all, it met expectations."
4.0,love them...
4.0,"Just received this, i just want to say its like pretty sturdy and actually holds good shape, i feel like i can but a good bit of weight inside it and it wont flex the sides to much. Also feels fairlyibg insulated and thicker than id imagine."
4.0,Really cute. Looks just like the picture!
4.0,"My wife loves them - the only drawback is for think tabletops - Purse Hook Hanger Caddy by SilverHooks has a longer hook, but isn't as compact and fold up like the Uniqled. Both items perform wonderfully keeping your purse off the floor and close to you to prevent theft."
4.0,"pretty cool license plate frame, and pretty heavy, made of a good durable metal, but only comes as 1, not a pair, u will need to get 2 if you want to frame both of the plates on ur car."
4.0,The watch arrived on time. It looks nice.i hope it'll  work well and right.
4.0,The only problem is that my wirst is really small and there is no way to use it as i would like!
4.0,I’m a guy who weighs about 115lbs and these were too big. I do love the material and the  it would be sliming if this was a size or two smaller.
4.0,"I love it. Lots of pockets and a very comfortable strap. I wish the lining was a heavier cloth, but it works for me. Zippers are sturdy. Very roomy.  I have not had it long, so I hope it lasts. Considering purchasing in red."
4.0,Love the feel and the weight of the coat. But for was a little smaller than I like.
4.0,Arm holes are tight but fits otherwise so that restricts arm movements
4.0,"I really love this sweater but I’m worried that since the others I have that have lace in them have gotten a little messed up in the wash that that may happen with this one too. So I’m going to just try to hand wash it only and never put it in the dryer. It’s a really lovely sweater though, really love how it looks on. I’m 5’8, 135 lbs and got a medium. Anything that has that nylon, modal blend I get a size up. If it’s a spandex blend I usually go for a small. Hope this helps"
4.0,The shirt is well made. Swag point makes good quality shirts. I truly recommend.
4.0,I really liked this but it’s really stiff when I’m putting ok my bracelet. It’s looks nice
4.0,I wish the turtle big for a men i will look fo good size like 4 or5 inches turtle. My son love turtle.
4.0,They are a tad on the large side but I'd rather that be the case than too small. A little stiff on the hinges. Can't complain about the price though. Exactly what I want from the price and style. Would buy again.
4.0,"Nice, stretchy, athletic kind of fabric. Some loose threads but seams are good after 2 washes. Fit my 8yo a little big, but she is more of a 7-8 size. Last time we ordered this it came in a beautiful metallic blue. A little disappointed that the color this time is a lighter blue."
4.0,"Looks SUPER cute as a sophisticated beach cover up.  Only downside is the tassels seem to be shedding quite frequently -- I keep leaving a black trail of strings everywhere I go.  Still looks great for the price.<br /><br />Please note -- while the fabric is sheer, the 1&#34; hem around the arms and the collar on the front is actually &#34;silk&#34; like and not sheer."
4.0,"This product is very comfortable feel great easy to put on but not for short women it's too long, Apart from being too long it's a great product I really love it I just wish it fit me."
4.0,"Lovely belt, but way too long."
4.0,"Love shoe..but size fits large. If  ordering,order half size smaller."
4.0,"I weigh ~180, 38DDDD, size 12/14 in US dresses. I liked the fit of the XL. It was comfortable. The V wire poked out some because my breasts sit low. There was a piece of fabric that kept popping up from the inside that I’ll likely cut off. If you have implants or smaller breasts the wire shouldn’t cause you trouble. Overall it was a great choice."
4.0,"I finally had to find a You Tube video to learn how to use the watch band on this watch, and I would much prefer that it had a different band.  My husband, who has some flexibility issues has trouble getting it back on when he has taken it off - even knowing how the band works.  A sturdy nylon one with a buckle would work nicely.  But I love the large easy-to-read dial that is also easy to see at night.  For the price it is hard to beat this watch."
4.0,It is easy to dress my disabled mother in this dress. It is soft and washes well so far.
4.0,some of the links were broken when i got it but i fixed it myself. i tried it on and love the way it looks but havent had the right occasion to wear it yet.
4.0,"Purchased to take generational photos with. After reading the reviews, I expected the length of the skirts to be long. Didn't expect to still have the issue with 6&#34; heels. I'm satisfied with the purchase. Just have to wear the skirt a little higher than I desired to. Btw the eldest in the pic is a 92yr old beautiful woman. Didn't expect her to be in heels. Skirts are perfect."
4.0,"This is the cutest Santa outfit I could find. I got a lot of compliments on it. I like how it came in a nice, large zipper pouch to store it in until next year. The material is nice, soft and it isn't thin like a lot of other costumes. The matching hat just stays flat and floppy though. So I didn't use the hat. I had a mistletoe headband and wore that instead. Can't wait to wear it again next year!"
4.0,The cap sleeve is nice and fit well. Skirt is pretty print but very long!! Will have to be altered.
4.0,I love the bracelet itself but it is a little bit difficult to adjust for size. Not a slip knot like I thought.
4.0,I bought these socks because of the colors.  Finding burgundy and green socks hard to find in the stores. They are nice socks.  Not as soft as some of my other socks but they match the pants / shoes that I needed.
4.0,has been received.. it's cute ...
4.0,A little long but otherwise fits the bill for what was needed.  I'll likely have it shortened and would even buy these again.
4.0,"Bathing suit looks good on. I am 5'7 , 145 pounds. Exposes a small amount of side boob, but nothing too flashy . Comfortable and stylish . A bit questionable when I first tried it on, but turned out to be cute."
4.0,Love the dress I was not expecting pockets though lol. Threw the look off. But I love how it feels and look so it was a good buy in my book.
4.0,"Very nice dress runs long, my daughter wore 3&#34; heels and still had to shorten 4&#34; (she is 5ft 3in) otherwise gorgeous dress, worth the money"
4.0,Looks good. We are using it as a prop for our business
4.0,"I love this flannel. I was really wary because like everyone has mentioned, the sizing is way off from US sizes, but it fits pretty well! I usually wear a size 6 and I’m 5’4 and 155lbs, so I initially ordered a US 10, which is a 4XL, but that was WAY too big. So I reordered it with a US 8, which is a 3XL and it fits way better. They are pretty long, but they have button ties on the sides to cinch them up, which make them more fitted.<br />My only complaint is that they’re not fitted for girls with a chest. I’m a 34B and my US 8 fits great everywhere but it’s definitely tighter around the chest.<br /><br />They’re incredibly warm though, and don’t cling to you like other cheaper flannels. I’ll definitely order more from this seller."
4.0,x-mas gift for nephew . He loved it
4.0,"I really like how the fabric absorbs perspiration,  great for those of us going through menopause.  It's very soft,  as well. I just wish the fabric wasn't so heavy, it will be great in the cooler months but a little too heavy for hot summer weather"
4.0,"I love how the fabric actually drapes and breathes a little (sometimes fabric is SO cheap that it makes you itchy/hot right off the bat). I am 5'8"" usually a M or size 4 in tops - I ordered the size 6 which said 2XL on the tag. It fit perfectly. I hope that once I steam it it will look even better. The buttons are shockingly beautiful - almost an opal effect and they look very expensive. I can't say I would wear this top alone but under my tuxedo this looks FABULOUS and expensive."
4.0,"I normally wear a 16W, and XXL fits well without clinging. Tag indicates ""dry clean,"" but I have machine washed and dried this blouse on gentle at least 12 times. It did not shrink or fade. But it's not high quality material, so I wear a tank or camisole. Overall, a nice blouse for the price."
4.0,Nice size I was looking for but the backs are alittle too big
4.0,Material not what I expected but looked ok overall.
4.0,"This works good, but I don't know if it's washable."
4.0,"The hat is beautiful and well made but it fell down over my large head and I couldn't keep it up without raising the front high on top of my head so I sent it back, otherwise, I would have kept it had it fit."
4.0,Just a simple but nice look.  You can wear it anywhere.
4.0,Love the price! Pretty cheap for all it came with.<br />One item was broke when it came in like it was cut too short. I wore the diamond stud one for about 2 weeks and a gem fell out so had to change it out. I think it's a good pack to start with after you get your nose done to see which style fits you best. The diamonds are on the smaller side. They came in 3 seperate baggies.
4.0,"This silk scarf is so incredibly soft I was very impressed. The care that was taken in packaging this scarf is amazing it was very carefully packaged in a nice thick zip lock type bag along with it came a gift box, gift bag, a Chinese knotted charm. Everything is such nice quality the gift box and bag are really nice I did not use it because I loved the scarf so much I'm keeping it for myself. The scarf is really soft and comfortable to wear feels so nice on my skin. The colors are bright  the print on it is really nice. Very impressed with the quality of this scarf the material is really high quality material. I would recommend it to anyone and I would most definitely get it again. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Comfortable right out off the box.
4.0,"I'm in LOVE with this bracelet.  My best friend and I joke that she is the Elena to my Caroline, and vice versa.  The bracelet is amazing, the length is good, and its good quality.  However, it did arrive extremely late.  Still worth it though."
4.0,I like the style of the tor rings. However the picture makes you think the toe rings are much smaller and more dainty.
4.0,"Runs a little large, but I wear it to lounge around the house."
4.0,"The design is very cute.  They look lacy with a small amount of gold thread woven in, but they're not thin like lace socks.  They're more a medium weight, which I love.  They're not as soft as all cotton, but they're comfy.<br /><br />I didn't think they'd be too tight around the ankle.  After all, they're low rise and the band really isn't too tight.  They feel fine when I put them on, but sometimes after wearing them for hours they leave a light imprint that can be itchy.  Maybe I'm just sensitive.  That's ok, I still wear them when I want to dress up my look.  I can always change them when I get home if they begin to imprint."
4.0,Perfect for the grad party we are planning
4.0,I have only just started using this when working out. Seems to help not really sure at this point.
4.0,"I liked the material, it was not too thin or heavy. I liked the pattern. I could not get the skirt to look right on me, personally. It just didn't seem to fit comfortably."
4.0,It’s ok not too bad. After a while parts are started to loosen
4.0,Love the feel and the way my parts fit I do prefer this style now
4.0,The cut is a bit funky and it's slightly large and VERY staticky.
4.0,Colour of handbag is exactly as seen in photo. A little smaller than I expected but still useable and cute!
4.0,I expected the pins to be bigger but they were cute so I don’t really care :)
4.0,"It is actually kinda nice. The color is beautiful. It is very very thin so it needs to be had washed. But for a cool evening in the summer, not bad at all."
4.0,"Quite happy with the fit.  Have a sunshade atop the RC over which the antenna towers.  It takes a bit of imagination to see that only the hooks, holding the iPhone,  of the antenna are under the shade.  My i7 leaves a fat thumb width distance both sides to spare for larger phones under the magnetic folded sections of the sun shade.<br /><br />As to  signal enhancement, cant speak to that.  Trashed it last week and its in for replacement.  Thanks to Care Refresh.<br /><br />Updated - Have full 1 mile, a double distance of signal, without.  Might have gone further had I started with more than 60%.  Signal indicator showed 5 bars at auto RTD"
4.0,"It is lovely and I was proud to wear it.  Many, many compliments.  Looks so much more expensive than it was.  I am convinced that Amazon is the way to go.  I HAVE NOW BECOME AWARE THAT I NEVER RECEIVED THE EARRINGS. SO THAT IS DISAPPOINTING AND I WOULD SURE LIKE TO HAVE THEM."
4.0,"Liked this dress a lot, but it ran a bit small and is super short. I am going to have to lose a few lbs to have it fit properly. I also didn't like that the back was plain with no ruffle like the front. So that's why I give it 4 stars. Looks cute on though!"
4.0,to dainty
4.0,"The dress was nice but I was under the impression that it'd be long, almost floor length. I'm 5 ft 9 and it stopped at my ankles. Will return."
4.0,"You’re going to love it!!!! Fits perfectly, great material, and worth every penny"
4.0,My 6 year old loves them. They fit her great.
4.0,"It a little big for me, but there is the draw string in the back. Great coverage.  I haven’t washed yet so I don’t know how it holds up."
4.0,"I bought two, a purple and a pink.  Both met my expectations in color.  The purple was very purple and not too red or not too blue.  The pink was a pink and did not resemble a hot pink.  They fit well and seem to be of good quality.  I haven’t cycled them through the laundry yet.  I founds some strings hanging from one of the shirts.  These are medium-weight shirts and the pink one is slightly more translucent than I would like.  The shirts arrived in an Amazon bag and were folded together and lacked any internal wrapping.  I found this a little off-putting that possibly many hands have been touching the shirts between the factory and my home.  Other shirts I order from different suppliers on Amazon were each sealed in their own bags.  Not these."
4.0,"great for my baby to wear in the hallways of our apartment building, instead of wearing socks.  But they just fit him and he is 9 months. I hope they fit for a couple more months"
4.0,"Just got these yesterday, but they seem good! Fit is comfy - I usually wear a 36A and I ordered the medium. The pad inserts are the same ones that you get in an inexpensive bathing suit top. They are fine, but not great. In conclusion, for the price, these bras are going to work out well. And the &#34;grey&#34; is definitely a really pretty purple, not grey."
4.0,"The original ""Eastern Dragon"" mask I received was made of a knit-like material that was VERY comfortable.  The 2nd mask I rec'd was a stiffer & less comfortable material.  Still my favorite mask."
4.0,A great pair of glasses all this considered. I knocked off one star since I can see the ceneter plastic while wearing them but once you get used to it no an issue. While not a super sturdy feel for the price they are nice. I have dropped them and have had them squished and they retained the shape which is a big plus for me.
4.0,Very small<br />Did not fit my 10 year old but the quality and value was good
4.0,"They are super cozy, however, the waist tends to roll whenever I bend over and I have to constantly pull them up. Worth the price though."
4.0,Finally recieved it and yes I love it
4.0,"Much warmer than expected - !  Also definitely on the small size - I have a small woman's hands, and they fit me fine."
4.0,I really like these slippers but they seem to be a bit loose and I ordered a small.  Good thing I didn't order my shoe size cause they would be falling off my feet.  I like them because I can wear them outside to walk my dogs without having to switch my shoes. I would have given a 5 if the fit was a bit smaller (about 1/2 size smaller).
4.0,Nice boot but runs large.
4.0,Muy bonita !!
4.0,Cute shoes. Comfy. Size was larger then expected for my shoe size but still fit.
4.0,"I wish it came one size bigger, came in short sizes, and the waist hits just a taaad too low. I'm busty but short - because of the patterns and it hitting at my natural waist, it looks like I'm wearing a child's dress. I think it would look better as an empire waist."
4.0,Good product.  Worked as expected. Great for gifts. Arrived timely.
4.0,The hat is great and looks pretty close to the Cousin Eddie one. However there was a stowaway tick in it. I mean he could have hitched a ride from anywhere during the shipping adventure... but you might want to take a peek inside if you order one.
4.0,El largo muy bien
4.0,"I only have one criticism of this watch.  Since it is a quartz, I don't know why it must sit as high as it does.  A slimmer profile is entirely possible and would be better.  That said, I love everything else about it.  The face is absolutely beautiful.  I've always loved the tapered beveled hands on a watch as well as the hour markings.  Gives a beautiful glint.  It's like the design in the 50s typical of a Hamilton.  Only time will tell if the finish holds up.  An Orkina I really liked turned green on me, hope this one doesn't.  While activating the movement, it felt very solid, yet smooth.  If the finish doesn't turn color or bubble up on me, this will definitely be in my top three watches, and I have several."
4.0,"The picture of the black dress with white dots shows it going to the ground all the way around; however, it is shorter in the front.  Disappointing that it isn't the full maxi dress but still cute.  Not true to what the picture shows."
4.0,I bought this for a gift and they loved it. I think it was a pretty decent quality and weight.  I would recommend this to any buyer.
4.0,"A bit snug, but if you are on the skinny side will fit well. It has elastic around the waist. A bit thin material, perfect for snowboarding around the neighborhood."
4.0,I was skeptical when making this purchase for several reasons.  It's not often I buy clothing on Amazon let alone online I like to try things on first.  But I had a &#34;White Party&#34; to attend and I normally don't wear white so I had limited options.  I haven't worn this to the party just yet but I tried it on and the fit was perfect. I have a &#34;curvy&#34; figure and back rolls and this was very flattering.  The quality is decent considering the price I was really impressed.  The lace detail is gorgeous.
4.0,"I ordered this for my 3rd grade nephew who loves the Scooby Doo cartoons. The quality of the backpack is good & he loves it. However this will probably the last year he will be able to do the standard ""large"" backpack due to the amount of stuff he's bring home in it. I would think this to be true with any of the animation backpacks. The dimensions appear to be similar for a ""large""."
4.0,"This is a gorgeous piece. I am only taking away a star for the chain because it is very thin, but it can easily be replaced.  Love it!"
4.0,"Great color contrast<br />They are little bigger than l wanted, but not that heavy"
4.0,I liked this earrings.
4.0,Nice and easy to put on with the tools that came with it.
4.0,"I think these would fit as expected if you order your correct size.  Some of the reviews I read indicated to buy a size up.  Well I did but now I have to reorder a size down which would be correct.  So with that said, this is a very pretty tank top but I haven't had a chance to order the correct size to see how it actually feels when working out."
4.0,"The shoulder bag is great! It fit everything I needed to put in there.  The only problem I had with this bag is with the zipper in the first pocket.  Because it go so much use, the zipper broke within a month of having the purse. Otherwise it has held up fairly well against the abuse I put my purses through."
4.0,"I wish the material was little thicker, but it's a very nice casual dress"
4.0,Love the bronze but the silver and gold looked a little cheap
4.0,"there are alot of them that dont work right out of the box (dead batteries)........but for the price, the kids enjoyed the heck out of them."
4.0,"The problem with this watch is the clasp. It needs to be rounded out. Because it has somewhat sharp edges, I find that I cannot comfortable wear it all day. More specifically I have to keep the band a bit looser than I like so it can move around and not create an indentation on my skin.<br /><br />Another minor setback is the lumes are very weak. Weaker than my Casio watch. Much weaker than my Omega and Rolex. One reason is that the lume is a dot on the end of the marker line rather then the entire marker.<br /><br />The good part of the watch is that on Amazon, it's selling for half the price of MSRP. Also in this form, with the silicone band, it makes for a very nice elegant, but every day wearable watch. At first I missed the second hand, but the watch is accurate and you can trust the marker between the minute marks. The glass has a anti reflection coating which gives a blue hue and it's actually nice to see it at a certain angle.  I find that the watch is nicest to look at in an angle rather than straight. The balance is better seen and more reflective that way too. The case is, IMHO, 1 to 2mm too big, but I got used to it.<br /><br />When winding the crown, it makes this unpleasant sound. But with the balancer exposed, I just wear it for a few minutes in the morning before I set the time and it works without manual winding. Or if you have a winding box, obviously, this isn't a problem.<br /><br />The open heart is the reason you buy this watch, and it's one of the best execution I think out there in this price range. I'm still unsure about the design decision to make it see through all the way to your skin tho, where half the time the background is your skin, and half the time it's metal. The amateur designer in me thinks it's better serve with a black background.<br /><br />Overall, this is a watch that you should consider if you want to spend around $1000 on a swiss-made, open-heart watch. Just don't buy it thinking it'll keep its value. Buy it because you have an itch for an open-heart watch."
4.0,"I normally would wear a Medium/Large (5'5"" 170 lbs) but to quote my son: ""Mom, you've gotten 'thick'"". It's really a beautiful summer dress, great material, but I think I should have ordered an XXL because the Large shows every bump and ripple in this old body! Not a pretty picture. I'll send it to my granddaughter who looks like I used to :)"
4.0,Pretty earrings but a bit heavy. After a full day of wear they actually began to hurt
4.0,Wear a medium in all shirts.  This one is really cute...just really tight on the chest.  :(
4.0,As far as fulfilling ones purpose goes these down booties are awesome! I bought them for my wife for backpacking because her feet always get cold. While the material isn't strong enough to walk around outside in it would work fine indoors and is great for popping on in a sleeping bag. Would definitely recommend.
4.0,"Very cute dress, unfortuately it was too short under the lace part. Fit well besides that. Seemed very well made. Would recommend for shorter girls. I have a long torso. For reference I am 5'7""."
4.0,"Nice beanie, but it’s BIG! My hat size is 7 3/8. I washed and dried it. It’s a bit smaller."
4.0,"Such sparkly pretty earrings for my little girl ., she really loves them but they are for short term wear for her because after about an hour or so she complains they hurt her ears.."
4.0,"love the bag, get compliments all the time, i read in some reviews that it smelled weird. This arrived and had no weird smell. The only downfall of this purse is.. the snaps kinda &#34;wear out&#34; and come unsnaped easily."
4.0,"Very precious and great detail. I get so many compliments on these earrings on a daily basis. Too bad the flower on one broke off while trying to take them out after only my third time wearing them. Oh well, that's what gorilla glue is made for. I still love them. Easy fix."
4.0,"Cute jeans. Unfortunately, the sizing was off for me. The 10 (my normal size) was way too small/tight so I exchanged for a 12, which are a little baggy. Still keeping them. The length is perfect ( I’m 5’9”)."
4.0,"The fit was way bigger than I needed. I wanted the baggy look but this was a couple of sizes too big.  Based on reviews I ordered a 3XL. My normal is a XL, sizes 14, or 12 on a good day but mostly 14. I'm 5'4"" / 165lbs. Since it was 95% cotton I decided to try and shrink it. It did a little, then I added one of those clips to gather in the back, still leaving some bagginess. I wore it to a concert last night, where it was hot and humid so the looseness was perfect. I'll have a friend take it in for me. I just ordered another one 2 sizes smaller, we'll see how that works."
4.0,"This earings took long to arrive and yes, they are nice but big, a lot bigger than I expected actually. Probably I forgot when I order them that they mention the size and that's why I was a bit shocked when I saw them. Aside from that, they are nice and don't look too cheap."
4.0,Good 👍 on cold weather or windy.
4.0,Do not use picture as guide to fit.  Not exactly what I expected had to end up giving away to family because of fit.
4.0,"Beautiful look that dressed up an otherwise plain dress. Only cons are that it’s very heavy and when it arrived, part of it had come apart and I needed to do a quick fix with some pliers"
4.0,All as expected. Good rain jacket.
4.0,"These fit well everywhere but the toes; they are pretty long, especially the pinky toes, I have to scrunch them up to fit right. This isn't a huge deal for me as it's an easy fix and maybe I just have short toes! I would buy these again, they are good quality and have good grip."
4.0,I ordered a 3x and I wear a 22/24.  It fits a little snug but will be fine under a vest.
4.0,This is a very pretty red dress that has a tie right under the bust and a ruffled bottom.  My daughter is tall so it was a bit short on her--this is definitely for petite or regular sized women.  It would be perfect for a 4th of July picnic or to a country dance club.  Very cute!
4.0,Initially I bought this in white and then I ordered different colors. It's warm and can make you look really appealing. I usually am XS or Small size and the neck runs a little tight. I'm not sure if this would fit a large or XL sizes. FYI my neck circumference is 12.6 inches
4.0,"Tore within 2 weeks of using it, but it was seriously over-packed, so probably not a fault of the backpack, so not taking any stars off for that. This is a decent quality backpack, great for the price. The nylon could be a little thicker, but again, for the price it is as good as you can expect."
4.0,This is very attractive and appears more expensive that it costs.  I received several compliments on it when it was on display during a holiday party.  The only thing is I did have to bend all the blades to get to work (and the instructions recommend this).
4.0,"I’ve got a pretty thick beard so I needed googles that didn’t over my nose. These fit very well and come with an really high quality case, but because the lense is so dark/tinted, I’m not sure that they’ll work well for they’re intended purpose of scalloping."
4.0,"Pretty and elegant, but I normally wear a large so that’s what I ordered.  I realized that the material is more clingy than I thought it would be, so I would really need xl or xxl to be comfortable.  Love the sleeves, which really add the elegance, but the purple of the sleeves is slightly different than the purple of the dress (I had also ordered the blue to compare, and the dress & sleeves match exactly on that one).  The purple color is also not quite as vivid as the picture (the blue was just as vivid as shown). But it’s a really pretty dress, and I love how there’s no built in waist line, which makes it lay smoothly and sleekly on someone like me with a thicker waist!"
4.0,"I got this as I wanted a pair of merino wool socks. These haven't disappointed, but they weren't exactly as expected. As you can see in the attached pictures, they're not at all as pictured. I got something resembling an orange ""camo"" design. I didn't mind, as they still look pretty good. I got size L, which is listed as appropriate for men's sizes 9.5 to 11.5. I wear 10.5, and these are good for me. I would not imagine that they would be comfortable for someone a full size larger than me at 11.5, so it's worth keeping in mind if you're considering what size to order. The fabric is very comfortable, and there's some strategically placed padding which makes them feel nicer. I can wear them for exercise or with fashion sneakers. Overall, I like these, but again, hopefully by the time you order, the product description (and images) are accurate. Also, carefully consider the size you buy."
4.0,Purchased a size 40 but it fits like a 38 slim.
4.0,"Love the shirt! It fit very well and the material is great. I only wish that the print had a little more to it, it's suppose to have kind of a faded look but it actually was TOO faded and hard to read what it said But still is a great buy !"
4.0,"Super cute, just as the picture shows! They are too snug throughout the whole foot though. I'm so disappointed to have to exchange because I couldn't wait to wear them!"
4.0,"This is a beautiful sweater.  I got the one in ivory in a size large (I'm 5""11, 160lbs) and the sleeve length was perfect.  The sweater itself was a little longer than I wanted,  it hit around mid thigh, but I kept it because I love the color (I don't know if ivory's actually a color but anyhoo) and I was happy to find a cardigan with sleeves long enough to accommodate my long arms. It's pretty warm as well."
4.0,"Love the sweater and receieved a lot of compliments! It fit comfortably everywhere except in the waist. I wish it was an inch or two longer, but other than that I totally recommend this sweater, maybe order a size up to get a more relaxed feel."
4.0,Great product!!! Got this for my godson for Christmas! And he thinks it’s an Apple Watch because he digital and has lots of things you can do on it!!!
4.0,"Nice, beginner earrings for a teenager. These have stayed nicely in her ears without getting caught or pulling her earlobes."
4.0,The watch came very fast and was well boxed. Its a good watch and easy to set up but it is pretty small. Besides that its good.
4.0,I LOVE this tote! It's darker than the picture. It fits my laptop and notebook which I carry around for work. Cuts down on the need to carry a purse and a laptop bag.
4.0,"Im curvy and the buttons around my breasts pull. Not a bad thing for my husband, but i would like it better if it had a better closure. It does make me look and feel sexy with the low neck line and hits my curves in all the right places"
4.0,A good cold weather cap. Solid fabric.
4.0,"It is a lot darker blue than pictured. It’s almost a light navy. Was disappointed. But function-wise,  it was great! Lots of pockets"
4.0,"I'm often not a fan of knit products because they often don't strike me as particularly warm, but I'm pleased to say this was an exception. The infinity scarf draped easily and looked cute, and within a minute or two felt like a soft hug. The hat was OK but not my favofite--the black puff on the top was a shiny black that didn't exactly match the yarn so I wouldn't wear it if I wanted to impress anyone, but for outdoor winter wear it's fine.<br /><br />Also, the ""green"" color is mostly black and white. There's a tiny bit of dark aqua blended in, but it's really only noticeable in the base of the hat."
4.0,Looks beautiful and fits well. However the edge where the magnet ends is not well finished and has a sharpness to it. I do recommend it as there are not a lot of choices in this color.
4.0,Soft and very wearable for any occasion. Like the ruffle a lot - bought it for my 29 year old daughter - just right for her.
4.0,"They didn't have a medium so we had to get large, knowing it would be easier to take it in.  It was even bigger than expected but the quality was pretty great for the price."
4.0,Love these watch bands. Very comfortable!
4.0,"Update: The silver/black version of this watch is not as rugged as the black version.  The buttons are now getting stuck, and I can only use this as a shower clock.  So, I took a star off for that.  The review below applies to the all-black version I also have.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />I need a bulletproof stopwatch for all of my workouts, sauna sessions, ice baths, and surfing in the Pacific Ocean.  This watch does all of that, PLUS it looks like it was born out of 1988.  I absolutely LOVE this retro design, especially the silver and black model.  I own two of these.  The only problem is that the stopwatch only goes up to one hour (59:59).  A lot of my sessions are longer than that.  I can tell you that it is 100% waterproof because I've put it to the test in 190ºF sauna, 39ºF ice bath, and 3-hour long surfing sessions in 55ºF water.  Nothing can break this bad boy."
4.0,"First one had a ripped strapped after less than a month of usage. I keep stuff that doesnt really require me taking in and out like my external battery. Anyways, the first one ripped and I got it exchanged.<br />Could be great if rhey reinforced the stitchings."
4.0,Looking nice but lil bit to small
4.0,Pretty cool......
4.0,"I loved loved this shirt. The style and colors were great, however I had to give it to someone with a flat chest. This shirt is definatelly not for bustier women even after ordering one size bigger to begin with."
4.0,Overall happy with my purchase.
4.0,Kids like them.
4.0,Delivered and works as Expected
4.0,"This is a comfy hoody. It fit pretty good but a little snug around the waist. I have washed it several times and did not seem to shrink at all. I like it and it is soft and comfortable. I wish I would've ordered a size larger, just for a little more room around my hips."
4.0,This outfit looks great on. Not something you would sleep in because it's not that comfortable. But for everything else it looks great! The reason for 4 stars is because after the 1st time wearing it one of the plastic gartar belts came off. Amazon did a replacement.
4.0,The belt is very cute with my dress.  Sometimes the clasp comes undone.
4.0,"Very cute, fits well."
4.0,4.5 stars. -0.5 stars because of the part ( retractable bar) that attaches to the watch itself. It is removable and can get lost easily. Other than that this is a solid 4.5 star product.  Comes with many extras such as a very useful tool kit for removing and adding links.  2 glass screen protector and prep kit.  2 awesome bands for a great price!
4.0,4 stars bc it's a very nice blouse and the size is a US size x small. I'm 5'5 115 lbs and it fits but the arms are short...🙁
4.0,"The fit is actually pretty accurate, and looks just like the pic.  The material that forms the facade of the blouse is made of a polyester cotton blend, so the cone does not fall as elegantly as shown on the pic.  But all in all, not bad for the price."
4.0,"I ordered a bigger size than I normally wear, based on other reviews, however, I should have just ordered my regular size"
4.0,The sleeves do like to fold upward so you will have to iron.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Unfortunately, I had to return this dress. I purchased a small and even that was way too large for me. I am 5'2&#34; tall and 111lbs"
4.0,Pretty but...Feathers put on with glue
4.0,"Love the quality and design. I got it for my fall and winter season! Just would hope it comes a little short. I ordered XS but it's a little long for me. So I'll wear it as a full skirt, rather than a midi skirt."
4.0,"I love the color of this shirt and it feels great.  It is thin, however so I use it as a layering piece. I expected that so bought it with that in mind. I also expected it to run really small (after reading reviews) and it does.  As long as you order 1-2 sizes up you should be fine.  Just don't expect a heavy/thick shirt."
4.0,I bought these for my daughter and they are super comfortable without looking big and clunky.  Perhaps because of how they are meant to cradle your heels the size is not true to fit.  I got her a size larger than her regular size.  My friend had the same experience she got a size larger just to get the primary benefit of this shoe the comfortable.<br /><br />So the only reason why it is not at a 5 is because the advert did not focus on saying buy a size or a 1/2 size up.
4.0,"I have a satin pair of mischka badgley heels in trying to protect for my outdoor wedding, that's what I bought these for. They fit ok- the one set is too small and the other is a tad too big. They'll stay on for awhile but I worry about them falling off. They're made of a flexible plastic though so I really like them. Easy to walk in."
4.0,These are beautiful. I love the color and quality of the stones.
4.0,I was concerned about the strings under the arm but they didn't bother me at all. I am a 38G and these fit across my chest just fine. The only thing I would I don't like is how pointy the collar is and it flips sometimes because of it. But other than that I love how they dress up my sweaters without the bulk of a full shirt
4.0,came promnptly
4.0,"These are cute socks and a real bargain... BUT they run small. It’s hard to get the sock over my heel which is disappointing since I’m REALLY in need of new socks. Lol. They also seem to be thinner- maybe because they are knit more tightly. The top band isn’t as wide as the others as well.<br />I’ve purchased 3 other bundles of these kind of socks last year and they were perfect size- though they did wear through on ball of foot and/or heel more quickly than I thought they would. Maybe a year or so. Still, I like them enough to order again.<br />Anyway- the price is a real bargain for this bundle so I’ll give away and won’t bother returning. Ifyou have a smaller foot- size 8 or smaller they’re a great buy. Definitely recommend."
4.0,Really nice sized bag. Even held some of my full sized products. Good value for the price.
4.0,Great product for the price! Looks nice and great quality! Packaging look good also.
4.0,"I ordered a small and it fits perfect but the color is turquoise not green, only disappointment."
4.0,"I got this for my daughter, who is a huge Swiftie! She loves it, and is excited to wear it. It's a very shiny gold color, and seems sturdy. I think it would make a great gift for any Taylor Swift fan, especially since her tour is coming up soon. Overall, I'm satisfied with it, and think it is cute."
4.0,Good work shoe blends with any outfit.
4.0,Solid and good vibe
4.0,my boys like it
4.0,Love the fit but the product is more of a light red color than a bright red color
4.0,Very cute dress. Only complaint is it was too small in sizing. Still loved!
4.0,"Sizing was accurate, unlike most costumes that run very small. Decent thickness of material for a costume."
4.0,This dress is nice a stretchy. Bought it for my best friends wedding (I’m the maid of honor) and since covid she’s downgraded the wedding to a backyard ceremony. So this dress is perfect. Plus it has pockets!!!! Yay!<br /><br />Also it’s long and I’m about 5’3 5’4. Any platform or heeled sandle/ shoe would keep it from touching the ground.
4.0,She loves it as she considers herself a princess.
4.0,Perfect for our Halloween costume. Quick shipped too!
4.0,"Hello, the glasses fit well and do seem to help my old eyes.  Especially when meeting another vehicle.  Thanks."
4.0,"Me gustó mucho el material, pero se altera la forma del sombrero cuando lo empacan, sin embargo recupera su forma pero se demora, deben mejorar el embalaje del producto para evitar estos inconvenientes, por lo demás está muy bien."
4.0,"It could be a little firmer, I wish it had more hip control as well - Make sure you wash before wearing - They will lose a lot of color when you wash them - I am hand washing. No issues with the legs rolling up, but the top has rolled down. They do what they are made to do for the most part. I'd buy again."
4.0,These are super cute! They are kinda small though but I love them.
4.0,Comfy for hubby.
4.0,Very beautiful. Not disappointed in the least.
4.0,Very nice looking hat! lots of compliments.
4.0,"Nice dress. More grey than purple. Fabric is a bit stretchy so if you are in between sizes order down. The back is sheer so I plan on wearing it with a shirt underneath. The dress fits nicely and looks more expensive than it is. The only problem is that the top of the dress buckles a bit near the armpits. I am usually a 10 so I ordered a 10, but it was too big so I returned it for an 8 which fit perfectly."
4.0,Theses are great socks but I have found the cut off ties helps better with my grip especially when planking on the reformer.
4.0,"I liked the style, shape and color, but the fit was tight and seemed to run a size smaller."
4.0,"First, I will confirm this band does fit the Garmin X40 Approach.  It arrive on time and as described.  My four star rating is due to the band not being a perfect copy of the original band. The fit and finish are very good but not excellent.  However, it does fit well enough  and the installation was easy except for the tiny screws.  My advice is to keep the original screws when you remove them from the original band. Unless you have steady hands and keen eyesight (I have neither) you may lose a few."
4.0,It’s very pretty. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because the chain that it came on was very cheap. I switch it to some extra ones I had as soon as I got it out of the package. If you were to leave it on the original key ring it comes with it would fall off and be lost within the first week. But other than that I like it. I would purchase again in a different color but I would know beforehand that’d I’d need some extra key hoops for it.
4.0,Great product and price.  It is very beautifully made and arrived very quickly!  Just in time for Christmas! Thanks so much!
4.0,"I haven't worn it yet but I really like it. The stripes of furry yarn give it a real different look, which is exactly what I wanted b/c I have enough conventional sweaters. It's loose but fits well. I tried it on for some coworkers & everyone loved the style & fit. I'm 5'9&#34; & 140 lb. & a size medium hits just at the hips and gives plenty of coverage to my 62-year-old tummy!"
4.0,They are nubby and rough which was NOT at all what I wanted.  I ordered them because I wanted soft warm sock in Navy.  The only thing that as advertised was that they are navy!  Also they came up on my sort for cashmere socks which I didn't notice that they WEREN'T until it was too late!
4.0,The suit fits great and has some quality thickness. The design hides some stomach bulges. My only complaint was that the orange was not the shade I was looking for or that was pictured. I kept it though because I liked how it fit.
4.0,"It fits comfy, but the shoulder part could be tighter."
4.0,Perfect size for my 7 year old. Not large enough for adult & not stretchy enough<br />To put on. Works great for what I needed it for!
4.0,Bought size 12 for my very slim 10 yr old. Was good choice. Dress was a huge hit at her dance and she was thrilled with the amount of compliments she received. Dress is ankle length and the back of it is just beautiful with the lace up ribbon..
4.0,"Looks and feels great, but the sizes run small. Order the next size up. Great company to deal with. Super fast delivery!"
4.0,"I have a small waist and a butt, so putting on and taking off I have be careful. It's fits well, since my waist is is small, I have room. Best advice is to go by your measurents. It's super cute skirt, but the button on the waist line seems a little cheap due to it wiggling around"
4.0,Great watch for the money. No problems
4.0,I had to alter it.. I bought a size small and I'm about 118 lbs to 120 lbs
4.0,Love the style.  Colors lighter than pictured.  A bit narrower than expected.  Nice coverup.
4.0,"It’s a great little bag, but I can tell it’s delicate so I would put a bunch of heavy things outside is a cell phone and small wallet (lip gloss, etc is fine)"
4.0,"For the price it's not bad, my gf loved it. I think stitching could be better. Material is OK not great and color is a bit off. Take into account sizing is not the same as in the US. But I got what I expected."
4.0,It’s one of the best shirts for that price.
4.0,The back straps are a bit large and they fall down over my shoulders. But other than that I'm very happy with my purchase. Fast shipping too!
4.0,"I ordered the green dress.  It has more of a blue hue than the olive green I was expecting.  The black print also fades with a blue tone.  It is a little more roomy than I expected, but is very comfortable, great over a swimsuit, or under a denim jacket.  I wish I would have gotten the white."
4.0,very attractive and sits well on the ear.but It is missing that spectacular feeling. kind of blaw.
4.0,"Like this easy dress. Was comfortable at Disney. Surprised how fit was. For price, will buy again."
4.0,Okay I know these are supposed to be small. The lenses are small but the frames are honestly made for a child. They do not fit well.
4.0,"Purchased a size 4T for my 32 month old toddler and was surprised it was somewhat smaller than expected. Fits for now. Was intending for him to wear it when he turns 36 month old<br /><br />Material is not bad, cotton and not too thick<br />great for wearing in airconditioned places in sunny Singapore"
4.0,I have gotten boots from Teva in the past so picking my size was simple.  The shoes are very comfy and fit great.  The only downfall is that since they are slip on with no zipper it was VERY hard to get my foot in. I have high arches so it was hard (and a little painful) to get my foot in.  But once they are on they are fine.  I bought these to replace an old pair of Teva boots that were about 4 years old!  So I have faith that these new ones will also last me a while!
4.0,"I direct traffic about 90% of my day and the red palm with an X and hi vis yellow and arrow made my job a lot easier day 1. The only issue I have is that they are so tight. I have small hands and even though they are an XL they left indentions on my hand and hurt my hands. Day 2 I put them on with another pair of gloves and no issue, except for the fact that I am wearing 2 pairs of gloves."
4.0,"Unfortunately the laces on these are very poorly made. Bought 2 pairs of boots and 3 of the laces have already snapped. HOWEVER, the warmth these provide for the price makes that totally worth it. My kids were out in the snow for 3 hours today (about 30 degrees outside), with thin socks, and their feet were so warm when we came inside. The laces is a negative, however you can flip the laces the opposite way when it breaks and make it work because it’s an elastic lace. If you’re looking to not spend a lot but have warmth, these are worth it."
4.0,"It was just what I needed to take on vacation<br /> I could put my wallet, phone and a couple other items in it and not have to carry a big heavy purse."
4.0,"I received these (near-sighted)sunglasses with a little trepidation whether or not they would work as advertised.<br />I thought, oh no, when I couldn't find any directions there's this one graphic on the zip-lock bag that holds the glasses that clarifies the whole thing. Easy once you see it! So, at first glance these are not as nicely made as one would expect for $29.95. The plastic is rather light and I would be concerned about crushing and breaking these in a purse or pocket so I would recommend you get a glasses case for these. The focusing was easy and surprisingly worked very well. I say that, tongue in cheek, because you never know. I give these 4 stars because of the lightness in construction and the size was smaller than I thought that they would be. These are great for a pair of backup prescription sunglasses keeping in mind my previous thoughts.<br />I received a discount for these in return for an honest and fair review."
4.0,Arrived on time and as described. I really like these in so far and they are really pretty!
4.0,Good product and fast delivery!
4.0,"The color is pretty much accurate while the copy doesn't state the color, it is a rose gold color. The earrings are lightweight and just as pictures, ear huggers..small."
4.0,My wife loved it and it was delivered on time.
4.0,I bought this for my infant. It was such a cute product. It looks the same as the picture. It is simply way too expensive.
4.0,Fabric was nice. Print was very pretty. Looked like a sack on me. Not at all what I wAnted to look like. Am returning.
4.0,"Love this shoe. Fit perfectly but it's a bit uncomfortable, will buy again tho!"
4.0,"Light weight for fall could be a little longer, not much softness ton the inside"
4.0,"I haven't gotten to swim in it yet, but I love how it fits and I feel cute! I added a picture so people can see what the two piece looks like on a bigger girl. I'm 240 pounds and 5'4&#34; and this is a 4x"
4.0,"These earrings are awesome, however I returned them because of the color.  These are more of a brighter olive green and I wasted an emerald green.  I own several pairs and love them all."
4.0,Run small go up a size or two.
4.0,A bit big but I like it nonetheless
4.0,"Super cute, but a little large which makes them a bit heavy on earlobes."
4.0,"These run a little small, but I like the lower cut neck, as I'm sensitive to tight necked wetsuits."
4.0,I loved the green and wish I could have kept it but the arms and hood were too long and the torso was too tight. I am 5 ft tall and heavy so it might fit a taller person. Amazon handled this return beautifully!
4.0,I like this.  Looks good on me.  Definitely use the size chart
4.0,"Very comfy, perfect length. I use them to lounge around the house, and they're great. Stay up well. Only complaint is that I wish they were fitted to under the knee instead of above it, like my others have been."
4.0,pretty but smaller than i thought
4.0,The colors were exactly what I was hoping they would be.  Width is a bit more narrow than 1/2in
4.0,"I like it but the inside snap tore away the second day I had it, so I cannot use that snap."
4.0,"I purchased this watch for a theater production.  I arrived promptly and is extremely attractive.  Since I'm not &#34;testing&#34; it out to see how it is as a time keeping piece, I couldn't give it 5 stars, but for my purposes it was an excellent choice."
4.0,This is a very nice jacket! Super soft and very cute! lol 💗 boys can wear pink too! 🥰
4.0,It's good. Fits with no problems and I like the look it gives me and more versatile to wear with different outfits.
4.0,I used this at a graduation that was held at an arena. Anyone with no bag or a clear bag was waved through.
4.0,"First and foremost, the lenses in these glasses are amazing.  They are polarized and offer a great level of shading (not too dark but even in full direct sun are dark enough).  Love the mirror effect on them and the blue color.  The frames are light weight and comfortable with no sharp edges or rough spots.  The frame color (white) is nice when you leave them in a hot car as they are much cooler to the touch than dark colored frames, but the white does nothing to make the glasses size more reasonable looking.  The size of these glasses are almost comical.  They are huge!  Everyone in our family tried them on and we looked like Elton John  with those grossly oversized glasses.  My wife said she felt like she was wearing a welding mask they are so big.  If you like those oversized huge glasses then these are the sunglasses for you.  If you like a more compact or less radical glass then look elsewhere."
4.0,"Although the plastic is a little harder and less forgiving than the original Oakley nose pieces, these meant I was able to replace the originals, which had cracked, offering more life for a great pair of sunglasses."
4.0,"The costume is cute and perfect for my daughter, but one size fits all!?!  It just fits my daughter who is 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.  I'm a bit heavier than that and there's no way I would fit it into it. Also, not the best material, but for one Halloween night it would be fine."
4.0,Perfect winter coat for my daughter fits just right and feels very well made.
4.0,very nice....have one on versa too
4.0,"I was surprised at how thick and bulky they are given the product description.  You won't be able to do much, if anything, using the touch screen feature and its hard to grasp much of anything.  HOwever I bought them mainly for warmth and they provide that very well."
4.0,"Good fit, some stretch, comfortable"
4.0,Loved the fit very comfortable and price great
4.0,"Giving it at 4 - super cute dress! Fabric was so wonderful, feel like I need to point out it’s probably best for non curvy girls. It was very form fitting in my chest and hips area, but bulged weird around my natural waist since I’m particularly hourglass shaped. Had I ordered a bigger size, I think it would have been too boxy for my body shape. Seemed like a great dress, I was disappointed to return it."
4.0,It is supposed to be a 16 inch chain but was a bit bigger
4.0,"When I saw the pictures of this set I thought it will be soft! Well, it is not! I mean, is like 3/10 soft.<br />The fabric is medium weight, so definitely for autumn/winter.<br />The print is fun, my son thought it was a skeleton! Haha..<br />I am 5’5 and 135 lbs. The pants fits me right to my ankles. They are high waisted. And they have an adjustable drawstring in the waist. No need to use it because it has a VERY VERY tight elastic.<br />I ordered a size medium just because of the pant size. And I wanted the top to fall over my shoulder. I could say I already size up. But I will for sure size up to a large. Even if I think it fits me good, it is not as comfortable in this size.<br />It has pockets.<br />I would use it not as a pajama but maybe to go on the grocery store or to go pick the kids up from the line in school.<br />It is not a bad set, but i was hoping for a better one."
4.0,Very sturdy just don't get the brite colors unless I use flash on my camera.
4.0,Pro: come on who doesnt love a beardie with a hat.<br />Con: strap that holds hat is elastic but it seems to fit a little tight.
4.0,These were cuter than expected and fit nicely over glasses.
4.0,"I normally include pictures in my review but this one looks exactly like in product photos. Tells time correctly, but more importantly the decal of sponge looks good. Leather bands and chrome enclosure. I give it 4 because it's exactly as it should be but it's not a high demanding product."
4.0,"Very cute sunglasses. They arrived fast and as described. However, the only downside was that they were heavier than expected and a little to wide for my face."
4.0,I can only judge for myself.  So sometimes the pants are long.  Sometimes they are larger than I expect.  So either I need to trim the bottoms or live with the drape effect.  They are mostly used for working out so its all good.
4.0,The material of the shorts are perfect for working outside in the summer. The fit is phenomenal
4.0,fits good!
4.0,Me and my husband Rid two times a week on the bicycle and I really need a pair of padded bike pants and days work perfectly.
4.0,Great fitting alternative to my Tungsten wedding ring.
4.0,Very comfortable and looks cool
4.0,"This is a cute top, seems well-made and the color is great. It's just on the small side and isn't true to size. I ordered a size up and there's no extra room."
4.0,Loose fit but cute
4.0,I like these for pajama bottoms.  They are way too thin to wear out of the house.  They fit a little big. But as I said make great pajamas
4.0,It was very pretty. I got a xs but still fit me big but I'm also very skinny so that's what I was expecting. Other than that I love it.
4.0,"I ordered a pair of rough outs for reenacting, but when my shipment came in I found a pair of Paratrooper Corcorans. Somewhere there must've been a mix up, either way I got a better pair of boots for a cheaper price."
4.0,These are a bit small and tight on my head. Otherwise a good product.
4.0,The shirt is very nice but the size chart is not accurate. I wear a size 6 or 8 depending on how the product is made and this shirt runs really big. I could wear this shirt as a short dress. I ordered a XL but wish I would have ordered a small or medium. I would recommend the shirt but ordered your true size (S M L XL). Don't use the size chart regarding an 8 being an XL. If you were a small order a small.  Another plus is the product is made in the USA. That should have been my clue to order my true size.
4.0,"This is a spectacular necklace that is well designed and sturdy, but it is very heavy.  I have rather prominent collarbones and it hurt too much to wear it.  Also the color is much brighter gold than in the picture. The blue and gold were gorgeous together."
4.0,"The colors and the way it fit watch connection. Just which the band came a little larger, had use almost the hole for right fit."
4.0,Good quality for a cheap pair of sun glasses.  These are oddly sized.. they appear bigger on me than I would of imagined.  They seem to sit huge on my face but aren't too wide for my ears.  They're snug width-wise.  I look ridiculous with them on though.. can't expect much ordering glasses online though - these seem to be nicely constructed and durable.
4.0,"fits as expected.  The straps are detachable in the back, so I don't wear it as my primary swim top, because I'm paranoid that it'll detach whilst I'm in the pool.  The cups provide good support."
4.0,It is very comfortable it does run small true to size I could have gotten a medium it looks very fashionable it looks nice with whatever you ware
4.0,"If you have a 6/7 year old I'd size up. They *might* work through about a US size 9. They did have a bit of shrinkage (which we were expecting). They are also fuzzy/pilly after one wash. They are thick, cute, and look very warm. We should have gone for the next size up."
4.0,It was a little shorter than I would Want it but besides that it was a nice short and loose enough for me!
4.0,"Since my feet trend warm in every season, these are great socks (maybe not for arctic winter conditions) year round."
4.0,"Very nice - I'm aware that it's super delicate so not washing, despite wearing to the beach on vacation. Just spraying with Fabreze and saving for next trip."
4.0,wish it had a hidden hood
4.0,"It is nice, but the orange is bit brighter than expected. More neon than image led me to believe, but still good quality."
4.0,"Not the best quality stones, but okay. Very good for the price."
4.0,These glasses are much cuter than I expected.
4.0,"Item was just as described, and is lovely. Great purchase!"
4.0,"The dress is adorable, but I ordered a 1x, and received a 3x... had it sent to my parents house since I live in an apartment and wanted to make sure no one stole it.  Being holiday season, I decided to have it altered instead of returned for the right size,  and it turned out fine. A little longer than it was supposed to be, butt I'm ok with that part.  It was pretty inexpensive and the seamstress is a friend so didn't cost much. Overall happy with it,  just wish I'd gotten the right size to begin with."
4.0,"I have a couple pairs of these in different colours. The first ones I bought are my favourite clothing. This last pair are the exact same as the first pair... and I don't really want to wear them. They're thinner and scratchier, fit differently, there's a hole in the pocket.<br /><br />If these had been the very first pair I'd gotten, I'd've never bought them again.<br /><br />I will have my eye out for different sweats from now on. I'm disappointed. I thought I had found something I could just keep buying. (I had secret plans of filling my wardrobe with many of the colours and wearing them all the time - since that's what I always wind up doing ayway.)<br /><br />P.S. They're still flattering, but I don't think that will last long with much wear, given how thin they are."
4.0,"Está bonita, me quedó un poco grande."
4.0,Since the product has not been used yet it’s hard to write a review..... I was not impressed by the quality of the material .... Time will tell !
4.0,Great as the gag gift.  Does need to be a bit bigger in length and especially width. Fits more like a bib.
4.0,Great fit but the neckline is a little too large I wore it to work and everybody loved it it's beautiful
4.0,Not very big. Bracelet won't fit husband's wrist. More for young teens
4.0,"Great quality and not see though. Also liked the textured/ribbed fabric. I would recommend sizing up, I’m 5’ 7” and 162lbs and should have ordered the XL instead of the L. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because the snaps come unsnapped really easily. That could have been because I’m long waisted, though."
4.0,"Actually pretty nice, but just looks too perfect compared to the real one"
4.0,I like the fact that the description was fine.  The product fit as expected and I would order from this company in the future.
4.0,"Cheap. The rings can be altered in size, but they are still uncomfortable. Try another company."
4.0,Super cute but it fits sort of weird on me.
4.0,"Love this dress! Super comfy! The only thing, the pockets fall right at my hips, so they look a little larger than normal.<br />I wear a 16/18, and the xl was perfect."
4.0,"I like the very comfy fit.  The fabric looks like it might snag easily, but I haven't worn it yet, so don't know how it will hold up.  It's very flattering."
4.0,I really like this Hairagami Original black product.  It works great!!!!! I would definitely purchase again. Be careful of copies.
4.0,Fits all my stuff perfectly for our trip to Vegas
4.0,"A little darker than i expected, but still a fashionable accessory"
4.0,Dress fits almost perfectly! Received it much quicker than anticipated. Looks great for the price!
4.0,"Great color and supper fun pattern, look exactly like the picture. They did shrink a little in the wash, but otherwise no complaints."
4.0,"you can tell its off brand but, it’s honestly great if you can’t get the actual merch, reaally comfy on the inside, i also suggest to get two sizes bigger, if you can"
4.0,Nice!  Comfy
4.0,"They are nice pants.  They feel a bit like they're going to fall off, I keep having to hike them up in the back, but they don't feel wrong in the waist.  The length is good, and I love the color and material."
4.0,"Very pretty, but a lot of sizes are too big for me.  :(  They were  nice quality, but only 2 of the sizes were actually what I would wear in my 2nd hole, so they didn't really work for me.  Know our carat sizes before ordering and you won't be disappointed.  They are very nice earrings, just not for me.  Maybe if I were in my 20's, the larger sizes would suit me, since they are more trendy now.  I'm 42 and feel silly with anything too bulky unless it's a dangle earring.  Ho hum. ;)"
4.0,"This is a light weight material.  The dress is very long, but I am tallish, 5'7&#34; and it hits the floor, I'm not thin at all!  Got a 4 star because the pockets don't line up exactly, and that is kind of irritating. I haven't washed it yet, guessing I will hand wash in cold water & hang to dry. It is good to wear on a hot day, as it is so light weight of material.. Not bad for the price, be even nicer if I were 5'9&#34; and thinner!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B06ZZJ42JD Liebeye Women's V-neck Polka Dot Loose Boho Long Maxi Beach Sun Dress Printed XL]]"
4.0,Great boots love muck brand they are really great quality!!! These boots are heavy though
4.0,good deal!!! it is just hard to visualize what is the design on it.
4.0,Beautiful shirt. Low cut unless you bottom at least 2 bottons. I rated this 4 stars because it is a little short. I’m 5’7”
4.0,Great for price. Lace catches on to everything including heels
4.0,"I liked this dress, but it was not as I expected."
4.0,We had to return because they were too small and I didn't want to purchase another Incase the size was off again. They were nice quality but won't work for us!
4.0,"I like it. the lock is not rounded off so its a bit sharp when putting it on but other than that, its nice"
4.0,Is a pair of pants that will take a lot of wear in the field. Good manufacture with solid stitching.
4.0,"The material is ok, it runs small.  The construction on the hood isn’t that great as the seams started to come off after only 3 wash. For the price I don’t think is worth, but if your child love the Hulk, you just have to buy it."
4.0,"These are cute sunglasses; however I don’t think “Toddler” should be in the title because they are way too big for my 2 yr old toddler. Although it does say ages 3-10, I really think they would be best for a 10 yr old or maybe even older, seeing they fit my adult face pretty well. They do seem to be well made and for the price, I would recommend them for an older child."
4.0,"Look great, but blue mirror finish started flaking off within 2 week. Makes your vision look yellow rather than darker."
4.0,"I'm 5 ft., 5 in. and 114 lbs. I ordered a Large size for the T-shirts, and they fitted me pretty well. However, the material was a little thin."
4.0,"Definitely order a size up if you’d like it be more loose. It’s very soft and comfortable, but the ribbon that ties around your waist comes undone."
4.0,"These are very soft and warm. I have tiny feet and these fitmme perfectly. Someone with large feet, these may be tight."
4.0,I got the white and midnight blue. They feel and look just like the real apple band. Only thing is sometimes it’s a little hard for it to snap on but once it’s on it’s on!
4.0,will wear them under clothing (dresses
4.0,Love these!!!! Turned green too quickly though (sad face) but they were cool while they lasted.
4.0,Very pretty dress. Size is smaller then usually. I would order a bigger size then u normally wear. But over all it is a very sexy dress.
4.0,Color is exactly what I wanted. Keeps you warm.
4.0,"I got an XXL. Bust would not close, I think I got one button done. Snug around belly. I am 6 months postpartum. 220lbs. 43” bust (at widest area), 36” natural waist, 44” waist largest area below belly button, 51” around hips."
4.0,"Fits well, doesn't hang out of my nose. Occasionally sticks out and I have to push it back in, but otherwise pleased with purchase"
4.0,"I like its color design, goes good with almost everything I wear, from casual to formal."
4.0,Great for the ladies at my wedding. I gave them to my bridal party and the mothers in case of tears. They were thin but effective.
4.0,this jewelryWe strap butterfly bead bracelet/ watch came on time... but after a few weeks of use the watch came off soo i wasn't happy about that.
4.0,"goes well with my cospaly, material is really cheap but that's okay"
4.0,"Socks are warm & don't appear to be cheaply made as others have stated.  After several washes, quality has held up well.  Love the variety of color choices as well.  Will definitely order more, especially for the price."
4.0,perfect for my bracelet! love it.
4.0,I like the style but it's very hard to see out of
4.0,Nice shoe but the insert keeps sliding out. otherwise pretty comfy
4.0,"Got this for the wife who is an LSU grad. I have the same one but the Texas A&M model. Has a lot of room for everything. Great shoe pocket that runs the length of the bag and a large zipper pocket with lots of dividers and pockets to store just about anything from keys to cell phones. It also have a zip through pocket on the back side that could be opened to allow the bag to ride on top of a wheeled bag in the airport. Good quality. Just what it says it is. I might have made it all purple. The yellow color is the only downfall. IMHO, my solid maroon A&M one looks better."
4.0,"large, heavy and fashionable...great buy"
4.0,My son loved these shoes.
4.0,"These are great for the price and being sterling silver, but the shape is imperfect. The inside of the rings are off...not super noticeable, not defective. Pleased overall"
4.0,"Great glasses. Would have been 5 stars, but was hoping they would help a little more with glare at night. They shipped quickly and were very reasonable."
4.0,"It's ok!General, common!Ear wall is too small!!"
4.0,These belts were good. Expensive but works perfect. Bit disappointed at the carbon fiber belt buckle. It is printed and not real carbon fiber. I would have expected it to be real for the price.
4.0,"Nice jacket but my only complaint is that the zipper is on the left side instead of the right, takes some getting used to but this is a nice light jacket."
4.0,Color is not as expected. It looks like bathrobe
4.0,"It's a decent coat with a nice sized hoodie that definitely covers all around my head. I like the double zipper so that you can have leg room to move if needed. Haven't had a chance to test the waterproofness but feels like it'll be fine. Love the zipper on pockets. No complaints. 5'3 and the medium fits right, enough room for under layers and goes all the way down to my shinbone."
4.0,"The top is really cute, but if your boobs are on the medium to large size beware.  I bought a small and wear a 32d and the bust area is really tight but works okay if I wear a bralette instead of an actual bra.  I think if I were to size up it would be too large everywhere else."
4.0,Me gusto ideal para el frío no es tan gruesa es más bien delgada y ligera.
4.0,cute jeans for the price.
4.0,"Love this style and they arrived  beautifully packaged along with a case and cleaning cloth.  However,  they sent the wrong color!  I ordered the peachy-rose shade, and received a slightly green-blue that looks basically clear when not in the sunlight.<br /><br />This style is very flattering .  I also have them in a gray gradient shade.  The first pic is what I received yesterday and the other pic is the same style in the gray shade that I purchased off of WISH months ago.<br /><br />The lighter colors are more suitable for indoor wear or overcast days."
4.0,Great Value! Very Lightweight. Trendy.
4.0,This was a gift for my mom. I love the cuff arms and button down look. Doesn’t look like my grandmas moo moo.  I took it out of the bag to put it in a gift box and was impressed with the material. Seemed to be of good quality.  It hasn’t been washed so I can’t speak on that. However it does seem to be true to size.
4.0,Great fit. I'm usually a large or XLR and I got the 2X. Love it
4.0,Nice bracelet.  But the wrong size. I got my refund right away.
4.0,"The product is over all good but it does run small. I do not have a gigantic rear end and these things barely cover me. They must be made for very small people. They are comfortable and if the added more material to the back, it would be the best."
4.0,I love the old fashion look. Will re-order in a smaller size.
4.0,"i would size up. i am 135 and 5'5 and got a small and it fits, but is just a bit short and tight on the sleeves. the material isnt as stretchy as you'd think so just size up. it is comfy though"
4.0,Very nice and sturdy socks.. Just not very soft
4.0,They are okay. Good quality.
4.0,It's a nice cap.  The material is probably a little thinner than I'm used to but it served its purpose during a recent trip.
4.0,Bought it as a gift. Fit perfectly on my 10 year old girl. She loved it!
4.0,"I'm not 100% sure but I'm pretty sure the crystals are just glass they don't seem like stone or dyed crystal. I got them for my daughter and she doesn't really care but if I was expecting the real stones I would have returned them. They definitely do not seem genuine. That being said, they aren't cheap crap either. They are good necklaces, just not real stone."
4.0,"great for wok, but it makes me look older and fat.  everything else is great. I bought two colors so it works for all seasons."
4.0,"I'm still getting used to carrying this wallet, but it's small and lightweight which are precisely what I was looking for. I am not totally clear on the purpose of the screwdriver and screws that came with the box, because there were no instructions (yes, this wallet might benefit from instructions), but it is exactly what I needed."
4.0,"They all came individually wrapped, there’s one pack of studs and two packs of L hooks.<br />The studs stem is short, so it doesn’t poke out very far on the inside of your nose."
4.0,I'm generally pleased with this mask and the way it looks on me.  The problem is that when I yawn it enters my mouth and I have to take it off to get it out.
4.0,I like it bought it to go to a special occasion
4.0,"They fit as expected.<br />It's a lightweight open front cover-up casual sweater.<br />The material is soft and flows with you.<br />I love the colors I have black, mocha, and olive.<br />Because they flow, they have and are a bit wrinkly.<br />The stitching is good, but not great, there are a few places with loose threads.<br /><br />My favorite part is the pockets!  Every sweater or jacket should have some."
4.0,"very comfy. It's cut a little big, but I think that's the style. Tried to shrink it in the washer and dryer, but it didn't shrink."
4.0,"Made well. Sewed on top and bottom. Wish a little heavier or double lined.  Seem too stay put, but they are still new. Coloring is vibrant."
4.0,This was an experiment to see if it would help keep my pants up.<br />Works to a degree but still I guess I will just have to use suspenders.
4.0,Well made.  Perfect carry on size.  Plenty of room for a weekend event.
4.0,"Great belt.  Looks great.  I am a 32&#34; waist.  I bought medium, it is too big.  I wish I bought the small."
4.0,Good for the price paid
4.0,nice for acrylic and priced accordingly.
4.0,After 5 of months of use the stretchy band ripped. I had to go to my local Walmart and buy stretchy band thread and I fixed it myself. Now it's good as new.
4.0,Love the look! Compared to the picture it is more fake and looks almost a bit navy blue/ black. Cross my fingers it lasts long with this cheap material
4.0,"I've had this for awhile, still in near perfect condition. Fits all my cards and money. Would buy again. But I don't need to!"
4.0,Nice quality. Lose fitting but good!!!
4.0,"I bought these for my sons birthday party. They are good quality plastic and seem sturdy, we haven't used them yet but I would recommend them so far."
4.0,I like how there different sizes of the stones and shapes.
4.0,Super cozy and comfy.
4.0,color is VERY bright!
4.0,This watch band is very long.  The directions to remove extra links is difficult to understand and harder to complete.  The color and quality is great.
4.0,"My significant other loves this bag. Its super sparkly and shiny. And the size and shape are cute and great, as per her. The interchangeable straps give it a nice versatility. I only wish that the ""chains"" were metal and not plastic. That would really up their durability. But in the meantime, they work and i can look for metal replacements ahead of time so i can lower the SO's eventual pout factor."
4.0,"Cool looking watch. The three small dials do nothing. The upper and lower buttons also are useless. Still, I really like it."
4.0,I really like the fit of it-perfect size but it arrived with some front stains on it!
4.0,"I really liked these. Or well the idea of these. They were very beautiful and look exactly like the picture. The only reason I am giving 4 starts is because of how heavy they are. They kind of don't really hang right because the front is so heavy and you can't wear them very long without your ears hurting. Other than that, I love them. Very pretty."
4.0,Cute dress! Shorter than I had expected but super cute all the same.. ordering another color!
4.0,And shrinks when you wash it. Get a size bigger
4.0,IF YOU HAVE BOOBS....DON'T BUY...EVEN IF YOU SIZE UP!<br />MADE FOR A SIZE B OR LESS.
4.0,"I love the feel of this shirt, it is athletic wear type material. It is a little bit short when I am working out and my stomach shows, so I wear a shirt underneath to cover. The bat wings are nice as well. It's nice that this shirt can go from a workout to going out somewhere if you wanted."
4.0,Didn't seem to fit well for people with  curves.
4.0,"Not the length depicted i the photo, otherwise I like this. Also, Its a tee shirt material."
4.0,Straps were a bit long but very happy with the top.
4.0,Muy buenos y resistentes
4.0,It tends to fall off while my baby is walking around. When I change her diaper I see it stabbing her leg. Its alloy faster than the snappi to apply but it really sharp
4.0,"I absolutely love this dress and I feel pretty cute in it. The boyfriend's jaw dropped when he saw me in it which is another plus ;). I would have given 5 stars, but I took a star away because there is a little extra fabric in the armpit area. I plan on taking it in a bit, and then it will be perfect!"
4.0,Beautiful dress but size isn't correct. 4-6 is really like 1-3. Sent back and reordering because it is gorgeous.
4.0,Works and functions perfectly. Overall a decent-looking watch but more of a feminine fashion watch than a masculine type of a man's watch. Oversized face with soft colors. Overall a great bargain for the price if this is the style of watch you want.
4.0,Very cute! Comfortability is so/so.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, definitely like the style.. Ordered a large based on my measurements & it fits & fit nice if I want a bodycon dress mu butt looks good in this. Now for a classy less fitted look I'll be ordering a XL. But it's a keeper.. 38,32,42"
4.0,"Fit is a little snug on sides of my head. Not easy to change lenses quickly. Otherwise, a good buy for the price and handy to have when I'm driving or on a boat."
4.0,"Great value! Four kids, four pairs of crocs, means many charms needed!! They all found ones they loved!!"
4.0,Love the color. The front part is very small. I will wear the bottoms Reverse to give more coverage on front. I don't mind the extra cheeky look.
4.0,I couldn't find something for my crochet purse so I had to settle with this. They're OK nothing fabulous but I can't expect much at this price. It's more about convenience and I can swap them out anytime.
4.0,Cutest keychain .
4.0,very fun and got lots of laughs at the picnic
4.0,It runs a little big in my opinion. I had to get some garment tape to keep it on my shoulders. Fabric is a smooth almost shiny fabric that has a lot of stretch to it.
4.0,"Very cute and pretty dress but it is a bit too big/long for me.  I have to wear it with some pretty high heels in order to not make me look like I'm wearing my mother's dress if you know what I mean.  I'm 5'2&#34; and I ordered size S.  The dress came exactly looking like the listing pictures, very nice sheer lace top.  Would be a great cocktail dress."
4.0,"I like to sleep in a lightweight, no underwire stretch bra. I found these bras in a specialty lingerie shop, where I was fit into a 'full' size. I saw the size chart that said full was good for band sizes bigger than mine and cup sizes smaller than mine, which explains the fit of the cups (adequate) and the droopiness of the bra (meant for bigger band sizes) no matter how tight I make the straps. I suppose it's too much to ask for a smaller band, bigger cup size ( full plus junior?) version.<br /><br />Summary:<br />- works for smaller band, larger cup in 'full' size than recommended in size chart. In fact, do not get the one size if bigger than DD even if band size is as small as 32.<br />- do not expect support, good for lounge wear or sleeping for large cup sizes<br />- I like the idea to wear over a bra for a camisole look<br />- get rid of the pads. As in, open the package, cut off the tags and pull out the pads and toss. They fold up in the wash, drift off in wear and are pretty useless.<br />- prices are better on Amazon than specialty stores"
4.0,"For the price, I was happy with the quality. I really liked the small sweep on the back of the dress. I wore this to a gala event I was working at and received many compliments."
4.0,I bought this sweat shirt for my husband and it looks very good on
4.0,Nice earring they are very pretty great gift will recommend purchase
4.0,I liked it. Was a little larger than expected but still fit my head.
4.0,"Nice material and colors. It is about 1 1/2 to 2 sizes smaller than the other shirts I have of the same size. An x large fits more like a medium. So if you normally wear size 2x, you're out of luck. Unless of course you like it to fit like a girdle, which certainly isn't flattering to a plus size person."
4.0,(Reviewed by my wife): This starburst star necklace is very pretty - much better in person than in the photos.  The pendant is fairly small but still eye catching.  The points of the star are very sparkly and the green/blue center is gorgeous when it catches the sun.  I love the jewelry box that it comes in - green with a little rhinestone.  This is definitely giftable.
4.0,"I like the scarf, although doubting whether it is made of silk as described."
4.0,Soft material.  Nice for a cover up!
4.0,quality and fit not as good as I hoped
4.0,Very cute suit but way to small.  I previously read the reviews and ordered larger as directed and it was still too small
4.0,I love this tank top! The material is very soft and buttery. I got pale pink and the color came out super cute like the photos. The only con is that I would still have to wear a bra with the top
4.0,For the price I couldn't expect too much. It was cute pattern and fit well. The fabric is very thin. The slots are very high so you probably want to plan to wear some little shorts or sew it lower. I'm also pretty tall 5'10&#34; - so that might make a difference.
4.0,Nice color.  Simple
4.0,These are cute but HOT! They have extra layers where there is no see through material! So these would be great in cooler weather! But they are really cute on!
4.0,I use them everyday.
4.0,"The arms are inconsistent and tight in a few places, but it is a great shirt."
4.0,"These key rings are ok. The side-push opening works well and they are durable.<br /><br />Considering the alternative steel split-rings cost pennies, these don’t offer remarkable bang-for-buck. The 2-pack when I purchased was $10.<br /><br />If it was a 4 or 5-pack for $10 then i think these would offer more value."
4.0,I am not being paid or compensated in any way for this review. I did follow the instructions and ordered one size up so I ordered an extra large we're typically I would be a large to extra large I have a long torso 38 inch around bust with d to a double D cup. If it's wonderfully my boyfriend loves to see me wearing it but it is too short to wear out as a dress. I am 5 7 but I have short legs and a long torso. It looks great to walk around the beach with but other than that it comes up to about an inch past my crotch and my rear end. If I walk extremely careful I could wear it as a dress but definitely could not sit down. I washed it and hung it to dry and it still fits exactly the same. Extremely comfortable and extremely flattering. If it were two to three inches longer I would have rated it 5 stars.
4.0,I am a 6 in street shoes and a 9 fits me well in these pointe shoes.
4.0,"I have several of these dresses and my only complaint is the waist seam is above my waistline.  I wear them during the summer because they are cool and easy to wear.  This last one had a hole where it had been snipped with scissors, but I just whipped it closed.  For the price, you can’t go wrong."
4.0,Bulkier than i thought they would be and a bit stiff.The gold was a bit much too but overall they would look great with a cute dress or something like that. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,The size is right but I can feel that the width is a bit snugger than other house slippers. The design is a simple one which reminds me of clogs when I wear these. The inner liner is soft and comfy. The outer soles feels sturdy under your feet. These have been put together well with no crooked seams or glue residue.
4.0,El vestido es lindo igual que en la foto que enseñan lo único que no me gustó es qué hay que cogerlo dos tallas más grande de lo que tú eres .
4.0,A very nice set. Would be better if the cufflinks were double-sided.
4.0,Nice shirt and well made but was a little to &#34;fitted&#34; to be comfortable for me (LT).  I gave to my son who wears the the same size I do and he is comfortable and happy in it. - I felt like a sausage.
4.0,Fast ship good quality
4.0,"i dont know where to find them, but this hat was really tight on my head, and didnt stretch much"
4.0,"Beautiful handbag, I loved  it...but the black leather border from the key chain thing is coming off within two months, I purchased the bag in  late June this year and used the bag only couple of times..little disappointed... But its a beautiful handbag!"
4.0,"If you're looking for a cheap wig that will get you through a convention or maybe Halloween, this wig is worth your money.  It's very long, and great for the lolita Fluttershy cosplay I wore to Otakon.  It also isn't very shiny, which makes the hair look much more &#34;natural,&#34; if that's possible with pink hair.  However, this is not a &#34;high-quality&#34; wig.  I don't recommend brushing it, and be very aware of any catchy jewelry or clothing you have on.  The wig was constantly getting stuck on a ring I was wearing, and due to the plasticy nature of the hair it was very difficult to untangle without ripping.<br /><br />As mentioned, for the cost, it is great.  But if you're looking for a high quality wig that will last you awhile, go somewhere else and expect to pay more."
4.0,Adorable slippers but run very small. I ordered 9-10 and wear 8 1/2 shoe. Barely fits.
4.0,"While this dress is absolutely stunning, it just didn’t work for me much to my disappointment. I am 5’6 130lbs with an athletic build. It fit very tight in the top and too loose in the midsection. The model must be a size 0 because I am a slim size 6 and it was very unflattering on me. So sad it didn’t work out because it really is a gorgeous dress for a great price."
4.0,I added another tie to my patriotic collection. The blue is a touch off shade.
4.0,Ok easy to use but seems like it might take some time to be a little less stiff.
4.0,"*I am a female*<br /><br />They weren't as big as I had hoped, but they are still nice and very fashionable. There are so many ways that you can wear these scarves and style them. Glad I bought them!"
4.0,Love this scarf and can't wait to wear it with my Marvel Boots. It is super cute and a good length.
4.0,"I love this dress, the fabric quality is just lacking a little.  Still worth the purchase price, but after washing a few times you can tell it’s getting worn."
4.0,"It's stylish, hopefully it's warm."
4.0,Little small and very stiff fitting shoe takes a while to break in
4.0,Bottom fit great but the top was way too large!
4.0,Great wig for Halloween and it can look very beautiful. It does look fake but great for photoshoot. I did a photoshoot with this wig in white and love how it turn out. Does need to take good care of the hair.
4.0,My wrist is small to medium sized for an average woman.  The band is long and bulky for me and it always seems that I run between sizes so it's either too tight or it flips around.  Pretty blue and functional but the bulkiness makes it uncomfortable at times.  Good value for the price though.
4.0,"... but a nice gift for a Dodger fan. She loved it, as I gifted it over the holidays. A good stocking stuffer and unusual. For the price we can't complain."
4.0,The fabric wasnt completely what I expected. But it fits good and I will definitely wear it in the heat!
4.0,"I liked the color, but the dress did not fit as expected. There was extra room in the midsection under the seamed area. It may have been perfect for one who is pregnant."
4.0,Affordable cosplay option!  Looks great for just being plastic!
4.0,A little small but so soft and loose I love it.
4.0,"These jeans are light weight and made of stretchy material. They look like they fit tight, but they are very comfortable. They have a tapered leg at the ankle. I purchased the light blue. They fit true to size. They go great with a pair of boots or any casual shoe. Machine washable."
4.0,It was everything I expected just a little bit too big but I’ll still work
4.0,The earmuff part is a little wonky and dont really cover the top of my ear since it attaches closer to the cheek area but the masks themselves are a pretty color and are really soft. And I like that they are adjustable.
4.0,"For the price its a nice shirt. Fit as expected, soft material. Took away one star cause it is see through! Had to get white t-shirts for my boys to wear under. Washed easily, no shrinkage"
4.0,"This is seriously so, so, so cute and comfortable. This is hands down one of my favorite cardigans. It keeps you WARM, and is very stylish! Only complaint is that I ordered an XL (I wanted it to be a big baggy) and the arms are pretty snug, feels more like a washed large. I wish it was more true to size."
4.0,"Nice wallet made from recycled rubber products.  My concern is that the pockets are a little shallow which don't allow for a credit card to be stored deeply and consequently pop up and hang out from the pocket, causing me some concern that the card may fall out entirely.  The wallet is beautifully stitched.  I would have liked to see a window pocket for the driver license so that I could show it rather than having to take it out of the wallet when asked for."
4.0,"I think the shoe is good. Not awesome. But good. It's really light weight and VERY breathable. Love that. But the shoe is a bit wide for my foot and the way it fits the bottom of my foot makes me feel flat footed. Never had any problems with shipping, packaging or the seller. All good there."
4.0,Beautiful!  Love these.  Do wish they had better indentations or were screw-ons for the back...but I can't have everything for this price.  Pearls are beautiful!!!!!
4.0,Fit is on the small side. Wish I had ordered up for my son
4.0,"These are definitely more like thick tights rather than leggings, but they still worked for what I needed. I love the stirrup. It isn’t too tight around my ankle, but keeps the tights from creeping up. I could probably have gone up a size, but these were acceptable. Overall I’m happy with the purchase and may get another pair or two."
4.0,This is a beautiful skirt. I ordered a medium because I'm normally a size 8-10. My weight is 145.
4.0,I’m 5’3 103 lbs and ordered a small. It’s definitely snug but not in an uncomfortable way or to the point where everything is showing. The belt is very cheaply made and meant to be held together with a pin. It also looks a bit awkward but i just ended up not wearing it. Overall it was good for the two days it was worn.
4.0,"Update:  Received replacement bows in the mail today from Charles David and are very happy again about purchase.  Thanks to the efforts of Jennifer from Charles David I will be looking to buy other items from this manufacturer in the future.  Would have given them a 5 star rating but with the bow issue a 4 plus is all I can give.  Thanks Jennifer!<br /><br />Got these shoes about two months ago and they are great looking but are cheaply made. Both the bows have fallen off and one I was able to glue back on, the other came off and is lost.  I contacted Charles David directly to see if they could help and they wouldn't even bother to answer e-mails back. So now I'm stuck with a pair of worthless, mis-matched shoes. I would look elsewhere, especially if your planning on wearing these with pants/jeans. Mine were size 6 in Camel."
4.0,happy with belt. after i figured how to fits together.
4.0,"The shawl part of the vest is loose, it doesn't stay flat once the jacket is off.<br />Good materials though."
4.0,Bien hecho y material estético
4.0,"If I had a dollar everytime I bought something offline and wasn’t worth the money.. but this actually is! It’s not the heaviest material, but it’s def going to last. For the price this 3pc set is great. I didn’t give it 5 stars because I haven’t washed it yet, so I can’t say if it shrinks (I hope not!) and my baby isn’t here yet so I can’t say for the size if it fits. But it looks like the right size. Overall I’m really happy with this purchase."
4.0,"So far, I love the look of this hat and it seems like it will do the job. The strap will help it from flying away while I'm on the water. It had a slight imperfection on the crown (two stray pieces) that I am debating on cutting. I wear a large hat size and this technically fits, but it tight. I'm hoping it loosens with wear."
4.0,Not bad looking. Just wish the red was brighter.
4.0,good quality & fast shipping
4.0,Cute and not super revealing on my teenager. I have struggled to find bikinis for my 14 year old daughter that didn't have cheeky bathing suit bottoms to them. My only concern is the bottoms might be very slightly see through because of the color.
4.0,Cute... bought as a gag gift! Thelma &  Louise. The look & price was right
4.0,El artículo viene como se esperaba.  Buena calidad
4.0,"Comfy, love the pockets but definitely size up a size."
4.0,Nice but not for me.
4.0,"Nice bag for the price, but the cross-body strap is just a tad too short for me. It would be so much more comfortable if it was just 1&#34; longer!<br />I love that the pockets are really deep."
4.0,"It is not very dark, but is it great being able to carry it randomly in a purse."
4.0,"Runs large but I love it, I'm sewing in a little hook just to be able to have it stay closed.. Ish.  Of you have a large chest it will just stay hanging open which is fine but I want to be able to kind of close it so I can go eat at our resort and not have my swimsuit completely showing."
4.0,"I love the material, it's very soft and high quality (and I am very picky about my t-shirts).  It just fit a little bit larger than what I'm used to.  I'm 5'11"" and 185 lbs and most large t-shirts usually fit perfectly.  This one is a little long and a little baggy, so I'm wondering if a medium would have been better."
4.0,The magnetic hook is a really nice feature. I put it on the metal frame of the windshield—the perfect place to put it. The only thing that concerns me is the nylon strap that connects the hook to the case is very thin and fragile looking
4.0,"I can wear these gloves longer than some others, because my hands don’t get hot/sweaty in them, and they’re not over-tight. I can do more things wearing them than I can with other gloves.<br /><br />The issue I had with them concerns the purple color that covers the tops of the fingers. On every glove (six pairs, twelve gloves), the color is laid down differently. In some it only goes halfway up the fingers, in others one finger, usually the little finger, ends short from the others. Out of twelve gloves, I found two, a right and a left, that approximated the same coloration pattern as each other. So out of six pairs of gloves, I have one pair that don’t give me the feeling, if I glance down at my hands, that I should be adjusting them somehow. Is this OCD? Could be, but I don’t think so."
4.0,Perfect addition to my halloween costume
4.0,"for new born twin babies, those microfleece quilted coats were so cute, but too big.  Had to return"
4.0,They’re very cute and I got a lot of compliments it they’re also pretty big and by mid-day my earlobes were hurting.
4.0,"Super cute bag, roomy yet small, and I get a lot of compliments on it.  My biggest issue is that it's very front heavy so it tends to fall over a LOT when I let go of it for a moment.  It also tips over easily with any kind of resonance, like a bump in the sidewalk or if I go around a corner too fast.  Overall it's cute and does the trick so... 4 stars."
4.0,There is only one flaw and that is how one earring is longer than the other. I think if they would have been the same length I would wear them more often and I've only worn them once.
4.0,"Cute really like it, fits well."
4.0,Very pretty. Had to get help putting it on.
4.0,Really pretty look just like the photo
4.0,"These are actually really nicely made underwear, but I had to stretch them the first time I wore them as they run a tad bit on the smaller side than I've ever experienced."
4.0,I love the design and fit of the dress but the stitches became undone.
4.0,This are holding up really well for a tuba player in the marching band. The ones he had before were tearing everytime he put them on.  The only down side is I bought XL and they barely fit his bear hands.
4.0,These pants are so warm!! I have trouble finding the right size in pants like these because you never know how much stretch you need. These pants are too big but work well over another pair for cold weather. They have a great layer of fleece on the inside so get your correct size and they will be perfect!
4.0,Cute and stylish.
4.0,"These shoes are very cute & the length is perfect.  They are a little big around my foot, but still wearable. The part between my toes rubs & hurts me.  I may try to sew a soft fabric around it to make it more comfy.  Otherwise great shoes & the price was VERY reasonable."
4.0,I think they might run a little small. The gloves fit snug and they are very durable. The only problem I have is holding onto certain things. They get slippery amd may drop them in the sink.
4.0,"Returned. The top color is more orange not red as seen in the picture. Otherwise, good vintage style."
4.0,They work great on the 4wheeler! Don't node separate glasses to read my map!
4.0,"These have gorgeous muted colors and are very soft and comfortable. However, I found them to be slightly binding on the ankle...maybe it is just me, but I thought from the reviews that they would be more generous in the fit."
4.0,Order 1 size smaller. I wear a medium but needed a small
4.0,Would have been 5 stars but received only the jacket without the belt.
4.0,"I’m 5’2 or 5’3 depending on the day lol .  155lbs’ D36. I should of got a med, I got a Large instead. The dress is nice I like it a lot. I will order more. It is nice for lounging around  the house. I’m not bottom heavy lol I kind of go straight down lol so the dress fall right on top of my feet so I have to lift it so o don’t walk on it ."
4.0,This dress is TOO CUTE!  I think it looks best with a crinoline underneath.  The fabric is pretty heavy (that was surprising).  Fits any figure.
4.0,Absolutely Beautiful. To big for a charm bracelet. I would not purchase for a youth. My 21yr.old God-daughter loves it. Hope the alloy chain does not tarnish.
4.0,"I like the overall quality of the hat especially with the ventilation.  However, I was expecting a bill that would be at least 2"" longer than any baseball hat that I own, and this one is only 1"" longer at best.  That being said, I wouldn't have spent the amount that I did if I knew the bill was only that length.  The picture on the ad creates the illusion that the bill is much longer than what it is."
4.0,Great pendant. Very pretty and substantial for the cost. Only downfall is that it did not come with a silicon necklace as stated.
4.0,Perfect for dance class
4.0,It was really cute for his party but it ripped after the first wash.
4.0,"This ring looks great, I just wish it had more size options."
4.0,Looks nice. Haven't worn it yet
4.0,"The item fits when you first put it on, however it begins to stretch slightly throughout the day.  I like my pants a little longer so I can choose to wear flats or heels and these work well within my needs.  Considering ordering different styles/colors.  LOVE that they have pockets in the front!"
4.0,I bought this as a gift and it is a very nice hat. The embroidery seems sturdy. I only just got it so we will have to see how durable it is but I am very happy with it so far!
4.0,the quality is nice for the value but it runs small
4.0,These are very comfortable and thin no show socks .  They have a silky feel to them.  Would have preferred more  cushion  to wear tennis shoes.  For casual shoes they will be great.
4.0,Like the Celtic Cross. This one works well for me.
4.0,"This dress is so comfortable, and fits so well. I am 5’3” and normally wear an XL or 2XL but the large fits just fine, and it has pockets!! The material is a little thin, but most clothes are these days, and considering the low price it is to be expected. I am definitely going to buy a few more in more colors"
4.0,"When I got the bag it was nicely packaged, with plenty of care, it looked and smelled really nice, like leather should.  At first i keep asking my family,  ""Does it looks like a woman's handbag?"", maybe I was a bit apprehensive being the big guy I am, but everyone told me it look unisex, ehemmm.  To me it still looks a bit like a woman's bag, but that is me and my insecurities probably.  I think is well made and looks good with plenty of space inside for the usual stuff I carry to the office.  Only concern I have is the big zipper on top sometimes is a bit hard to start opening, it get's stuck on some fabric below it and feels hard, a little bit of Vaseline on the zipper track should take care of that, aside from that not a bad looking bag for the price."
4.0,Fits good and is comfortable. Only complaint is the shirt rides up in the back some.
4.0,"Love the product, it’s light as a feather but my goodness, it’s makes a lot of noise next to the ears!!! Still love it and keeping it!!!"
4.0,Good material but the color is more dull compared to picture.<br />Overall still great
4.0,good for the price  I wear  them  twice an throw them away  they are cheap enough to do that  Im part of an honor guard  and  these work well for flag folding
4.0,I ordered a small and it was huge on me. I actually had to alter it and take a few inches off it to make it fit me and my busy still doesn’t fill it out. I wear a size 32 B bra. And size small shirts. It’s not stretchy and over all I really like it. Now that I made it fit it’ll be perfect for a costume.
4.0,there are good a blocking UV. and they feel well made. but the opaque plastic frame give you very limited visual field. don't where wail driving.
4.0,The band is really small I have small wrist it’s on the last hole. It’s a watch for work so a quality product at a price point where I don’t mind that I will probably destroy it in a year. The mechanicals though not worries
4.0,"the blue is much lighter, and its big on me (should've ordered a smaller size)but I can make it work...looks good on."
4.0,Reasonably priced cute dress!  Love it.
4.0,Fun keychain
4.0,"Good quality, liked the product"
4.0,"They are so cute! Wearing a face shield is so hot, so these are a lifesaver. They are lightweight and cute. I wore them for the 1st time yesterday & I received so many compliments on them!"
4.0,Beautiful. The bling is out of this world BUT it the necklace chain broke minutes after opening it to try it on. I’m not sending it back because it’s still wearable without the chain . AND one of the ear ring backs was missing but I can find another one around the house. Other than that I loved it. It would have gotten lower rating had it not been so beautiful.
4.0,Good quality shoe.
4.0,"This isn't pashmina, but it is an attractive wrap, and would be suitable for a cool summer evening, or to add a little warmth as an additional layer in early fall or late spring.  Now that we're in seriously cold weather here in the great northeast, it's only useful as a decorative layer.  No idea why it's labeled pashmina, as pashmina is Himalayan goat fiber, and this is 100% polyester, i.e., totally synthetic.<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.  I hope you found it helpful."
4.0,"I loved the look of the top in the picture but the fit is just too snug for me.  It is well made and I LOVE the color, a beautiful neutral that is not found in most athletic tops.  I bought a larger size to account for the snug fit but still too tight with arms and hem a bit too long.  For the right body type, I recommend this top wholeheartedly.  Unfortunately, I had to return."
4.0,Good for the price but not as waterproof as I would have wanted.
4.0,Arrived quickly and exactly as described!
4.0,"Great option for themed Mickey/Minnie Ears! Super fun! Well made. The headband itself is too thin. Worried about easy breakage, especially with my kiddos. Just seeing them made our girls very happy!"
4.0,This PICKBEAU 18K Gold Plated 3mm Cubic Zirconia Classic Tennis Bracelet is pretty nice for what it is. It is elastic so it has some stretch to it. I gave it as a gift to my niece for her birthday. I like the pink coloring of the stones.
4.0,"The Woman’s Ultra Soft Fleece Chevron Pullover Hoodie is very soft and very practical. The design is nice. There are three colors (black, white and gray) that form the design. There is a drawstring at the neck that you can use to adjust the neck. It is soft and fits true to size. And finally, it is machine washable. I did not notice any shrinkage. I'd recommend it."
4.0,"I should fit easily into a large, this was more fitted and shorter in length than I prefer. I’m taking into account I’m a person who likes my clothes roomier than they should be, this fit like a true medium and honestly it’s flattering (145–5’2”).<br />The color (green) rich and saturated, a true Kelly green and I liked the  zipper, it add some polished detail without taking away or being too much with the layered bottom. It’s a short tunic length though."
4.0,"Its nice, but the chain is big like in the picture."
4.0,Little smaller than I thought but my 2 year old nephew loves<br />.
4.0,The product was great except for some of the pieces started to fall apart so I had to resell them together. Overall my child loves it and it fits her really well. We got a size 140 and in length it was great she wears a size 8 normally but in her waist it was so big so I had to make some alterations.
4.0,"This is a great two piece set...I love the soft, stretchy material it was a bit too long but that was my only complaint."
4.0,It's adorable !!  It is just the right size for my little head and the large clip keeps it affixed pretty well.  You can 'arrange' the veil to come down over the face or kinda 'scrunch' it up around the bow itself.  Nicely done !!
4.0,The confirmation dress code was giving me a challenge - modest neckline and hemline and needed sleeves; this was a perfect solution! No 13 year old wants to look like she's going to an office job and the twirl and cut outs on this make it fun. Not sure I loved the quality of it but for the price and the specific requirements we had it did the job and she looked great.
4.0,"From my wife: i read the reviews and ordered a size larger (10), fits like a perfect 9. Super comfy, warm, love them."
4.0,My unbiological sister loved this. It was a birthday gift.
4.0,I gave it four stars only becouse the color cremesicle is see through. So I had to purchase something to wear under it. Other than that they are great scrubs.
4.0,"My boyfriend and I got these for valentine's day of this year (about 3 months ago) and the first couple days of wearing mine, I had green spots from where the piece had been sitting and oxidized. About a month ago I noticed the enamel in the center of mine had fallen out. Most of the metal at this point looks more copper than silver. As far as I have seen, the other one hasn't had any issues with enamel pieces coming out. Overall very satisfied. We both wear our bracelets nearly daily"
4.0,Perfect until I washed it. Washed and air dried and it shrunk. Doesn't cover my head as well now.
4.0,Nice fit I like it definitely I will recommend it to a friend
4.0,"I love BOC shoes, but I've never had a pair make this odd air sound every time I take a step.  You can actually hear me walking around at work, its a little embarrassing.  They are very comfortable and a great deal for the price, I just wish they didn't make that air sound."
4.0,"Item, to me, is not really sweat pants.  The item is thin an light weight more like work out clothing and not your standard style sweat pants.  I do like them so far and are great to work out in if you don't want to wear shorts in the cold months.  I would recommend this item."
4.0,"I bought this for my male best friend for christmas i love them and he loved them i havnt seen him wear them yet, but the only thing i didnt like was the leather was to light i thought i was going to be heavier other than that i love it"
4.0,"During the hot, humid summer months I absolutely, positively need something that will keep my hair off my face.  I like that it's broad around the front but just has a thin elastic in the back for comfort.  It's easily hand washed in a basin and should be hung or towel dried.  Whenever I see this style head wrap I always think of Norma Desmond and classic retro beauty queens."
4.0,The bag looks and feels sharp. Well constructed and esthetically sound.
4.0,"These run small which works for me. Very comfortable, like the color as well. Great for those who are petite."
4.0,It's good  for the price but could be better.
4.0,This fits fairly well. I'm 5'5 126Lb 33 inches B-Cup and bought the Large. Anthing less than than the large would have been to snug.
4.0,"very small, almost child size.but nice"
4.0,It wasn't the color advertized
4.0,"No cashmere I have ever seen looks or feels like these allegedly 100% Cashmere arm sleeves. In fact, I am virtually positive that if you tested the fibers, they would prove to be merino wool -- at best.<br /><br />Despite the dubious fabric description, these fingerless gloves/arm warmers are really great. They're very warm, very comfortable and very well made -- perfect for preventing drafts seeping up your arms.<br /><br />What is very cool -- what I didn't expect -- is that they can be worn two ways. One, as fingerless gloves with a thumb hole that helps them stay in place and cover part of your palm/ back of your hand. Two, as a wrist dickie that peeks out form under another shirt or sweater.<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY buy these again."
4.0,"Dress was a little longer than I would have liked; but it is a nice elegant dress, using as a graduation dress."
4.0,Its quite over rated by others on this page. Its good but it sticks to the skin .i got it in pink color the color is really good. It fits perfectly. I am 5'9 and it cuts just above the knee and it has beautiful swirl.thanks
4.0,"Very good quality. A little longer than I prefer with no apparent way to adjust it. Works well worn around your collar, but the Velcro connection on the neck gets scratchy. Since it's so long i wear it around my shirt collar which resolves that just perfectly."
4.0,"I bought this for a baby spice costume and it was one of my favorites yet! I did have to take the dress in at the top of the waist down to the top of my hips. Nothing too bad and I kind of expected to have to alter it a bit. Was very moveable and comfy especially for such a cute costume. I can definitely see myself wearing this dress for other occasions also which is always nice. I would say to order a size down, but it fit my hips perfectly and had I sized down it would have been too tight."
4.0,Loved them other than for that.
4.0,the  earrings were for a gift and  the recipient loved them
4.0,"Very cute. I wear a 7 but read that they might run small so ordered 7.5, think I could have used an 8 because of narrow toe area."
4.0,I like the jade earrings but find the backs almost too small to be functional. It takes a few attempts to insure the backs are on securely so that I don't lose the earring stud.
4.0,The Gage I ordered was too large to fit my nose. I should have gotten 21 or 22 Gage. The gem was a lot smaller than I pictured in my mind.
4.0,"The sash is nice, no complaint.<br />The crown, well...that one is big, definitely too big for my son."
4.0,Good quality bag that easily fits a 13&#34; MacBook Air and tracksuits bottoms and t-shirt in the main body. The colour is a rich dark brown and looks very well on the bag.
4.0,I normally wear a LG in most gear but after reading the reviews I ordered an XL and it is still very tight. I'm glad I did.
4.0,"used it while running and the shirt stayed in place perfectly, will purchase more in the future"
4.0,Decent product. It did not keep edges totally dry during workouts. It did a somewhat good job. It’s great for showers.
4.0,good product. a little longer than I thought but works well.
4.0,wish they were polished
4.0,Great for the price. They run a tad small but that's not a big deal.
4.0,"Ordered this one in Green & the Beyove Brand in Pink - same style, both in Size Small. This one is was about 2 sizes bigger than the Beyove, material is thicker, softer & felt better. The length on this Green one was also longer.  UnUfotunately he Small was too oversized on me. I usually take a medium top, size 6 pant. The Beyove was Small was snug but I don't like too fitted at the chest."
4.0,This kind of looks like a bathrobe on me. It’s not ugly but it just didn’t look right on me. Maybe if you’re super skinny and have a very small waist when you tie it it might look nice. Very lightweight material. You can’t wear this in the cold it’s kind of like a long sweater. Material seems like good quality. I ordered a medium and that is my usual size and it seems to run true to size. Arms are also long enough and I have long arms.
4.0,Bigger Than i thought.in the fog they Were Great.i live in a city so Its hard to Judge them when there r streetlight.everywhere
4.0,Extremadamente comodos y lijeros..se ven con buena calidad .. Lo unico es que me gustaria tuviera un material mas puerte en la parte de arriba...Solo el tiempo dira como salen al darle uso...
4.0,I thought it would offer more support for the Girls like a tank with a bra. For tank tops they are fine but not really what I was looking for.
4.0,I wish the sweater fit as the picture shows but still is a cute one. The arms hit just above my wrist. I'm a large and usually have issues on how the bust fits...there's no issues here. The length is nice with jeans...a couple inches below my belly button...not as long as the picture. The yarn used is soft and not itchy. Even where the metal grommets are it not hard on the skin. I would recommend hand washing and lay flat as you would most sweaters.
4.0,Bought it as a gift and she loved it. Not a bad deal for the price !!!!
4.0,I like the feel.  They are comfortable.  But they look like goggles
4.0,fit well and lasted well... My 9 year old wore it many more times than just for Halloween.  Very nice.
4.0,"I'm 5'8, 170 LBS, pants size 12, and bra size 38c. I ordered an XXL (normally I'm an L or XL) and it fits great! The bottoms are actually perfect. The only problem is woth the cups in the top. The cups are MUCH too small for someone who's ordering an XXL. And the padding is so stiff that it won't conform to the shape of my breasts at all. I'm barely able to make it work, but just a fair warning to larger breasted women: this suit probably isn't your best choice. Other than the cup issue, everything else (quality, material, durability, elasticity, etc.) is just about perfect."
4.0,"I am not sure whether any other cloth towel would work as well, but so far I have been pleased at the shine and tarnish removal properties of this cloth in conjunction with Tarn-X Polish.  I put it through the wash and there was fraying along the edges.  But otherwise it cleaned up nicely and is ready for another use."
4.0,I had to return it because it was to big. Read the reviews and they said it ran small to order the larger size. Well for me it didn't I have to reorder the small. It was really nice just hope the smaller size will fit.
4.0,The set was very cute. The scarf was not as heavy as expected so it was not warm for Illinois winter
4.0,"Much nicer band for daily wear.  Easy on and off, but it is a little heavy and bulky for exercise.  I have another band for that."
4.0,"This is a very comfortable top made from a soft, smooth fabric (not t-shirt material).  I really like it, but it runs large.  I wear a large to extra large and ordered an extra large.  But it seems significantly larger than most extra larges and the style makes it seem even larger.  It is very long, too, and probably best if worn like a tunic.  I ordered this in Ombre Ink Green, but it is blue.  A very pretty blue, but definitely blue.  I gave this a high rating because it is a nice top and I'll keep it.  Just know that it is large and roomy and not green."
4.0,It doesn't look as luscious in real life as it does here.
4.0,Purchased a gift.  Pleased.
4.0,"My boyfriend loves beer and noticed my bracelet didn't have anything that looked like beer, so I got this for him."
4.0,Works great with 125khz locks... love them.. only reason for the 4 stars is because not all of them work when you received them.
4.0,"The PICKBEAU 18 k Double Layered Paperclip Clavicle Choker is Beautiful and Lightweight. I think the two styles of chain especially go well together. The paperclip chain I really like and I think it makes the necklace look modern and trendy.<br />The chain does have a tag that 18 k is stamped on. The is a good sign that the chains are 18 k gold. The tag though does not have a hole at the end of it to connect it to the lobster claw clasp to it. (See Picture). So I took and removed the tag and its jump ring and reconnected them to another part of the chain. (I didn't want to leave the tag off because it says the chain is 18 k). I then put a jump ring on the end of the chain to put on the lobster claw. (See Picture) It makes it easier to clasp and unclasp the chain and for the chain to lay flat and not tangle. When I ordered the Pickbeau 2 layered Paperclip Clavicle necklace, I also ordered two other necklaces from Pickbeau. Both were two layered necklaces but different styles. I had to add jump rings to them also because their tags didn't have a hole in them either. Pickbeau might want to change the tags they use on the necklaces."
4.0,Trying to bring gloves back! Inspired by Melania’s inaugural look.
4.0,Grandson is small for his age so knew bottoms would fit big
4.0,"Thinner that expected knit, but I will wear as long as I can.  Worry about snagging."
4.0,Dress is really pretty but if you want it loose you may need to order two sizes up!
4.0,Good for spring coat
4.0,"I didn't realize I had to wait for this to arrive from Asia, but when it did, it was really pretty good."
4.0,"The image is exactly as it looks in the picture! It's soft, a bit more THIN than I imagined, but still very comfortable! Definitely cannot wear with just a shirt under on a super windy day, but it's nice when just a bit chilly! True to size as well! Almost no complaints at all!"
4.0,"Ingenious gadget!  Unfortunately for me it is too bulky for my GX85 micro four thirds aesthetic.  I plan to convert the strap that came with my camera and some extra material to make it work the same way.<br /><br />I really like how this works.  The strap slides between two adjustable ""stops"" which allow you to quickly move the camera into shooting position! Cool!<br /><br />I kind of feel bad about taking away one star, but I had to because the actual size of this doesn't come across in the description."
4.0,"Unfortunately this wasn't a keeper for us as I had ordered the wrong size. However, this product is high quality and looked great on."
4.0,"A little smaller than I expected, but very good quality, and pretty."
4.0,Very very light pink.
4.0,"Nice dress, I didn't care to much how it fit on me but hey we are all different shapes and sizes, I ordered the small and it fit perfectly. I am 5ft and about 145 lbs, if  you want a looser fit I would say order up but it may hit the floor, the fabric is thick and great to wear in the summer and fall."
4.0,"Had this a few years now and it’s holding up, but after drying it the first time, the center shifted- like it’s not straight at the seams anymore. It’s something minor but bothers me. Super soft otherwise"
4.0,"Hoodie fit perfect. However, it was not the same hoodie that was pictured. Still very nice design, but not as advertised."
4.0,"I have an average build (5'6&#34; & 135lbs).  This dress is very comfortable, but it's quite thin and isn't very flattering.  Dresses with a little thicker material don't cling and hide imperfections better.  Also, I like my dresses to come to the knee or just above and this one was a little more than that.  This dress would be great for lounging around the house or beach, but not so much out in public."
4.0,Beautiful top. But it doesn't look good on me.
4.0,"When I ordered I din't really though that it was going to be well design and it is, but even that is not completed made of leather but at least its partially made of leather."
4.0,"Very pretty...I wish I had looked at the measurements, they are really too big for a toddler..not the sellers fault I don't read :)"
4.0,Comfortable and easy to change out
4.0,"These shoes run small.  I ordered shoes 1.5 sizes larger than his normal shoe and it fits; however, he will not have any &#34;room to grow&#34;.  He states that they are very comfortable and is happy with them."
4.0,my fault for not reading the description better I did not know the item was made in china other than that I will use this as my cleaning brushes
4.0,"I like the look, and the idea of this belt, but it's poorly made.<br />The buckle keeps popping out throughout the day. It used to just be once or twice, but it's now a constant. Upon looking at the divots on the underside, they are worn and bent, resulting in the belt buckle no longer able to catch.<br />This belt lasted about 2 months.<br /><br />Edit: Upella reached out, provided a replacement. Their customer service made up for the dud belt"
4.0,"The scarf is a nice quality fabric and a great price ,however it could have been bigger/longer  in size. My wife is tall, and this item lacked the length one would assume for a scarf of this type  IMHO"
4.0,Very pretty. Good size and look nice. Was a gift and she loves them.
4.0,"I love this dress! I bought a small. I'm 5'5 about 123 pounds, with a 32DDD bust, 25&#34; waist, and 36.5&#34; hips. It fits really well, but I just wish it was a little longer. It only comes to about 3 inches below my butt."
4.0,"So small, hard to get on, easy to lose."
4.0,These bands are a great value for their price. I have only used the purple band so far. My only complaint is it comes unhooked from the watch face every once in a while.
4.0,Bought as a gift for sons girlfriend and she really liked it
4.0,"After having ordering this set I must say 3 years and they are still comfortable.  They wear great and wash well.  Cheap though the price maybe they are worth the price +. I only gave them a 4 rating because of some bad sewing, but I corrected it myself and they still wear great. I've seen where others have had problems with size, I am ture to size so I really can't say what a half size female might not have problems. About to order my 3rd set different colors."
4.0,Took  awhile but did get it.
4.0,I got plenty of compliments. Too bad I can only use them in October.
4.0,"Ordered the size that I thought would be comfortable (Size Large, I wear 8/10 usually); When they arrived they just fit- which would have been okay if I wanted a more fitted appearance. I'm returning them and have placed an order for two sizes up- hopefully that will do the trick!  (I'll update upon arrival)"
4.0,"Fits my wife perfectly, she went to put it on and unfortunately saw a hole (thread was starting to come out) and it’s in the front so it’s noticeable."
4.0,"Nice comfy light weight t-shirt, took  almost a month to get, due to being shipped from china, wore twice and probably won't get many more wears out of it due to already pilling."
4.0,"These dress is beautiful. Wish I didn’t have the extra baby weight, because I would have loved to keep it. Unfortunately it shows all the lumps and bumps and I just am not comfortable showing all that."
4.0,Took forever to ship but great for the price.
4.0,very pretty and the large sguare stones are navy blue.
4.0,"Very cozy.  Fabric is very soft and surprisingly thick, hood is very deep. Seems to be well made.<br /><br />By 'one size' they mean enormous, it could fit three of me. I don't mind, but I am a fairly tall woman; if I were 5 feet tall I would be lost in it."
4.0,It fit well and is a cute dress. The reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five  is because it is made of polyester. Sad.
4.0,It's very prettyqnd the pendant is big but light
4.0,"Nice material and color but shrank after first wash, so I gave them to my daughter!"
4.0,The buckle scratches a bit easy but still good for the price.
4.0,"Unsure if they are organic cotton as no labeling can confirm, but daughter loves them."
4.0,My daughter goes to gymnastics in a place where they also sell leotards. This one is much nicer and unique and cost half of what they are charging there.  I'll be looking for more from this seller.
4.0,The plant was still somewhat snug even after sizing up!
4.0,Bought these boots for my 9 year old. She loves them. Fit as expected.
4.0,Very pretty vintage dress.
4.0,Love the color size is just right.
4.0,This dress is great! I bought it because it had a v neck line which makes it so much easier to breast feed. (For all you mamas that breastfeed) it worked so great for that purpose. I have enjoyed wearing this dress and love the flowers! (I did have to put a black camisole underneath it) great for dressing up.
4.0,"The plus side is the angle is adjustable and timer can be set to up to 120 min. However, the temperature is set to be 42C. It probably works in many cases, but if you want air dry, or dry more quickly, it's not possible. I hope it can dry my ski boots, but yet to be tested. I still like it's lightweight and foldable, so it's easy to carry."
4.0,I love these shirts they are perfect for working out I have several of these but this last package I purchased smells like B.O. right out of the packaging.
4.0,This is a very pretty blouse. However it's very narrow around the waist kind of a tight fit.  It has a narrow cut so if you have a little bit of a potbelly it will be snug on you.
4.0,"Love it! The material is nice, on the inside it's a bit rough, but the design is amazing. Nothing was stitched funny or coming apart. Love it!"
4.0,"Very cute. Fabric is a bit thin, but with a slip under it, it looks great!"
4.0,Seems like it's holding time fine. Didn't care for the strap so I replaced it.
4.0,Not as nice quality as others.
4.0,"This swimsuit was cute, good stretchy good coverage just was extremely small had to return"
4.0,"I plan on trying making my own so I bought these to use until I do so. I like the fit and they hold scent well, haven't broken yet. However some of the white howlite? beads are flaking to reveal plain white ...are they not real? New to these, this could be normal."
4.0,"Cute dress, about 2 inches shorter then I expected."
4.0,I looooovvvvveeee this dress & I plan on getting this dress in Black & Red!! This dress is so comfortable. The only con is that it takes a long time for delivery!! I love this dress!!
4.0,"I love it! While tying though, it came undone. No biggie as it just looked to be hot glued. I am able to repair. It is the only reason why I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"I like it.It Fits nicely.I cannot give 5 star because I wish the manufacturer added more Pleats on the side as shown in the picture for XXL size too.Apart from that small disappointment that i did not get enough pleats on the side,i am satisfied and will keep the Kurti."
4.0,Absolutely gorgeous just like pictured. The bracelet size is very big though
4.0,I got two different xl shirts and this one is a little short .... it’s cool though
4.0,"Love this dress.  I am 5'4"" 200 pounds. DD chest with smaller waist and curves.  It looks great and the quality is fantastic."
4.0,A little shorter than expected but pretty
4.0,I like it. It really fit well. I’ll update if it actually lasts.
4.0,The design is nice fits comfortable.
4.0,Some of the stitching seems off. Where the black sections are on the gray pair it seems more like ruffles. Over all I'm happy with them and for the price they are great.
4.0,"This product is very comfy and stretches pretty good. However I have a smaller wrist so I have to make it tighter. But when I go to put it on, the adjuster slides to make it a little looser. But other than that, it's a very good band to have. Super cute. Love being able to stretch it up my arm to wash my hands to protect my Galaxy watch."
4.0,"Awesome cut! Choose a size smaller than advised, if you have an Asian frame."
4.0,Well made. Good shoe for play out side. Had to return them for a bigger size
4.0,"Unfortunately, my daughter had moved up a shoe size so these were too small but they are some beautiful shoes. I would recommend that you make sure you get the right size before ordering. Also, they did come in when expected."
4.0,"Nice product,  the sweat shirt fits a little snug"
4.0,"I received these socks a couple of weeks ago have worn and washed each of them.  They are not all exactly uniform but each one fits my average sized feet and by washing them in the machine and letting them air-dry, they have maintained their shape without any unravelling at the toe area. I have since received other yoga socks from another vendor and I would swear that they are the same. The white knobs on the soles of each sock arrived intact and has remained in good condition even after wearing and washing them. I've also found that these socks work well when I need to put on my thong sandals. A sample was provided for evaluation."
4.0,"I got a small, because I was told it ran a bit big, but I was also reading that it ran a bit small. So I got small. I am petit 94 lbs, and the small makes me feel I would have more comfort with a medium. It has a stretchy band, and fits perfectly. But I feel like if I had a day of bloat it would be snug around the stomach. It did not shrink in the wash or dry. I gave it 4 stars for the sew job. It's uneven the front grid. It makes it look weird hahaha. They should watch for that."
4.0,"I enjoyed carrying this bag around town. It's cute and good for everyday use. I want on vacation and used this bag to hall around all kinds of stuff. (i.e. beach towel, water bottle). I was amazed how much this handbag could hold. This is a great buy."
4.0,Great for gifts. Packaged well.
4.0,They are comfortable. I wear a size 6.5 - 7 and They bunch up a little. I would like them to lay smooth and not show when I wear them with cute tennis shoes
4.0,Fits a bit small.
4.0,Bought this item for my son for Christmas. I'm glad I bought the medium as when he tried it on it was a little loose. Not sure if it will shrink once washed. He loves it and is exactly what he wanted.
4.0,I wore this to my moms 60th birthday party and received many compliments. Unfortunately the side zipper broke and I had to get it repaired for more than what I paid for the dress
4.0,Cute but doesn’t like to stay closed when you mess with it to clean it.
4.0,Bought it to clean my Adidas Ultra Boost. Worked well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not effective on hard stains. (tried on Ultra Boost and Adidas Stan Smiths).
4.0,"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A 5 STAR IF IT FITTED, THE BLOUSE IS NICE, LOVE THE FABRIC, IT WAS JUST TOO TIGHT... I WEAR LARGE, AND I ORDERED LARGE, BUT, DIDN'T FIT, I WILL RETURN AND ORDER AN X LARGE."
4.0,"These fit larger than I was hoping, but very comfortable. They don't slip off my heals!"
4.0,Nice purse bought it for vacation.  It is very small though. While perfect for Las Vegas and to wear and keep my funds safe I had a hard time fitting my IPhone 5s with a case on it in the purse and fitting my small wallet in there.  This was a little frustrating otherwise made well and loved the crossbody option on it .
4.0,"Beautiful dress, super comfortable and light weight. It did have a small snag in it."
4.0,"They're good earrings for the cheap price. They're a little bit bigger than i wanted, but i'm still pretty happy with them."
4.0,Cute summer tee that can be dressed up<br />Or down. Nice fabric
4.0,"I thought they would have a more curved design to wrap a little more around the face, but it didn't take away from sunglasses as a whole.  The wood is sanded and polished to a very smooth finish, and will almost slip thru your hands if you're not careful.  They also are suited for larger faces, whether round or oblong/oval.  My only recommendation:  get some sunglass straps so you don't lose them."
4.0,"Fun black dress, true to product picture."
4.0,I had to end up cutting the waist because it was so tight! Not a Large/Extra Large at all!
4.0,"I bought this strap for another watch but I needed something to go with my Glycine Airman 18 while waiting for a black leather strap and this worked well.<br /><br />The strap is comfortable to use all day long, provided the watch you have is fairly light weight. This works great on my 39mm Airman. This type of strap WILL NOT work on a large, heavy diver. The holes along the stretch fabric will warp and tear.<br /><br />But for this small watch, it works well. The hardware is nice quality but I feel they should have made the buckle much thinner. It is totally off balance with the lightweight fabric used. The fabric can pick up fuzz from clothing and is prone to fraying. Again, you'll encounter this a lot more with a heavier watch.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's much lower profile than a standard NATO strap."
4.0,IT IS CUTE
4.0,Good gloves but gets dirty too easily
4.0,"This trench coat is perfect! It is very cute, warm and long. I am 5'0 and it goes about 4 inches from the ground for me. (I ordered a Small) Only issue I have with it is that it doesn't give you a lot of arm room in the back especially. Its a tight fit on the back in through the arm area. Otherwise, it is perfect!"
4.0,"These are super cute.. look just like they did in the pictures posted. I usually wear an 8-8.5 and I got an 8.5 and they fit fine. Only knocked off a star because they’re a little stiff but hopefully by wearing them, I can break them in. Let’s see! Other than that, great :)"
4.0,"It's a different look and it's ok; if you have wider hips & small waist, it would look a lot better.  For those of us who are bigger than a size 8, it's a very 'boxy' look."
4.0,Does not come with sleeves
4.0,Super cute on my 10 year old. I give it 4 stars because it was pricey for the quality of material.
4.0,I ordered the large but it is way too Big. I need one size smaller!.
4.0,"Cute but the glitter ✨ is ALL OVER YOU and your clothes and I don't like that,"
4.0,"Nice jersey, dries fast, looks cool, has longer tail in the back so doesn't come un-tucked, true to size.  Only downside is fabric snags really easily."
4.0,"nice stacker, I have two others this style fit well together, beautiful color, size 6 seems a bit smaller than a 6 but still fits nicely"
4.0,Some threads were even loose when the products came.
4.0,Good but lighter than expected
4.0,"I’m 5’3 and 200lbs. All my weight is mostly in my legs and butt area. This dress fit PERFECTLY and looked sooo so beautiful. And that’s why I am so sad to say I had to return it. It was WAY too short. I really wanted this dress for a wedding I’m going to on sept 1st. It was the perfect dress for me. Unfortunately the slightest movement and you could see the bottom of my cheeks. Other than being way too short, the dress was made well, absolutely gorgeous, and extremely comfortable. I can’t even explain how sad I am. It’s so hard for me to find a good dress for my body and I loved this one so much. I wish they made it 5-6 inches longer.... this was my dream dress. I’m only 5’3, so I’m pretty short. This dress was made for someone about 4’11-5ft at the most. I wish there was something they could do to make me a longer one. 😔 little bit heartbroken."
4.0,It was a little smaller than i thiught but otherwise will work great!
4.0,"It’s super cute but the fit is a little wierd, and the slit comes up a little too high to wear without tights or something underneath, still wearable and decent quality."
4.0,Great bag for quick errand runs
4.0,"My son loves his new boots. They're super warm and perfect in size. We just had a pretty big snow storm here in Colorado.  He wore them outside in knee deep snow, his feet, still dry and warm.  Great buy!"
4.0,Bought it for a best friend. Really cute.
4.0,"What I liked, it was well made and you could breathe plus you could add a filter in it."
4.0,"It's definitely off white or cream, not white."
4.0,Very comfortable.Reasonable price and fit was accurate. Worthwhile purchase.
4.0,Beautiful hoodie! My son loves it. Not as thick/warm as I was hoping for but it is still awesome.
4.0,"They are very nice and comfortable. Feels light weight. I think it feels better than the apple bands made by Apple, the only down side is they are a little hard and take more time to put on. There are also more holes and so it is a lot easier to get it to the size you need!"
4.0,I love the choices!
4.0,"What I liked most... nice vivd color and contour fit.  What I liked least... they give you the precisely exact size that you order, however no &#34;extra&#34; room at all!"
4.0,"Appears very well made. It is comfortable and flexible. Has a cuff design. I really enjoy the look of the three metals knotted together. I have yet to notice the ""medicinal effects"" of the ring. But regardless it is beautiful."
4.0,"This shirt was a great find.  My 6 year old son is obsessed with the 1933 Kong movie and loves this tee.  It was true to size chart.  The tee could be a softer/higher quality cotton for price.  It's your basic rougher cotton tee.  Also, the screen print could be richer.  Overall though, I am happy bc my son is happy and he would wear it if it were made out of bricks as long as kongs original 1933 image is on it!  Thanks for making him happy!"
4.0,I like them a lot they look good that match well I just wish they were a little thicker
4.0,Purchased for my husband before we went on vacation. He likes this wallet a lot!!
4.0,The front is a little too low. Otherwise it was a great fit.
4.0,"Very nice, but the bracelet itself seems a little too delicate.  I'm afraid it won't last long, seems it might easily brake."
4.0,Love the pendant but I’m not crazy about the chain that comes with it.
4.0,Muy bonito el vestido queda perfecto pero las mangas están muy largas yo creo debería hacerlas un poco más cortas eso haría mucho más bonito el vestido
4.0,"These are gorgeous earrings. I’d give it 5 stars but I just picked up one of the black earrings, and the stone had come out. Will try to fix it later.<br /><br />I have very sensitive ears, and normally closed back earings will make my earlobes really angry. Also, anything but silver, gold, or surgical steel will bother them. Skeptical when I read that it was sterling silver, but I want to head and gave them a shot. So far I have worn different pairs for full days, and it’s not bothered me at all. LOVE them!"
4.0,"Its a nice material, very stretchy and seems nice quality."
4.0,very nicely made but this dress probably runs 3 sizes small!  be aware!!  Arms are snug and it is not as long as it is made out in the picture.
4.0,"Very cute 2 pack with filters,just runs a little tight and I bought for a 7 year old."
4.0,"Bought these for the last leg of a Ragnar relay race. Our team name was &#34;The Ragnerds&#34; so the design fit the bill. Personally I wouldn't normally run in these, but honestly for a few miles they were just fine. Material is super shiny! (Which I love.) Might buy other patterns/prints just for fun. Also, for the price can't be beat. Would buy again."
4.0,"Cute shoe but run narrow, I have a medium foot.  I know somebody with a wide foot cat wear it.  I spray some shoe stretch in them otherwise the shoes are cute."
4.0,A little small on the torso. I ordered a large and I'm usually a medium. Still gives me a wedgie
4.0,Love this bracelet! Very cute.
4.0,"Looks perfect just like the show, breathable, great color and snug in the right places.<br /><br />The gloves are attached to the suit and are super weird so I cut them off and replaced them. I also made some boot covers so I cut off the foot. The waist was abit to long for me (5'3"") so it does bunch up some. I have 55in hips, and the back did give out abit and i reinforced the stitching. I normal wear a size xxl but i got xxxl which was the right choice.<br /><br />Would recommend to a friend."
4.0,"Not for everyone, but this wallet works for me."
4.0,"I ordered these for a Spin class and they work well.  Padding is thick, but not uncomfortable to wear for an hour class.<br /><br />I ordered the blue and they are thick enough.  Run true-to size."
4.0,Love this dress. I got a size 24 and it's perfect for nursing as I needed it for a wedding and it's so hard to find a breastfeeding friendly dress. It's a little longer than I like (below the knee) and I'm 5'6. And I would prefer it to be at the knee or slightly above. That's why I gave 4 stars. Other than that it's beautiful. The material is very sturdy but stretchy and comfortable.
4.0,Xl is still small..
4.0,"This was really cute. I purchased it as a gift for my man to go with a coat he already has. I only gave 4 stars because the material wasn't as soft as I expected. The fur was nice, but the other part I expected a soft faux suede."
4.0,"Smashing looking bag, only lost a star because some of the printing is a little faded. Can easily fit two beach towels, tablet and sunblock and water bottles in it, with room to spare, for the beach and it flattens well so it doesn't take up a lot of room in a suitcase."
4.0,"i like it; gooo quality, I like the 3/4 length for summer."
4.0,Love the way these fit but there was an issue of not being able to button them!  They forgot to cut the button hole so I had to do it myself.
4.0,"Soft shirt, seems like pretty good quality. Arrived in expected time frame. I typically wear adult small in T-shirts, so I ordered a large in this (since it’s youth sizing) and it fits great. My only complaint is that the branding logo is in the middle of the shirt (as picture) rather than close to the T-shirt design as listed on the Amazon picture. Overall this is not a big deal and I am satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,Won't fit my laptop but have used it for other purposes
4.0,"Was getting lower back pain from all the stuff I carry around on my belt and in my pockets. Been rockin' the 'spenders under my overshirt. So far I can really tell the difference. I gets the weight up off your hips and back very effectively. Easy to adjust, good hardware (though with some sharp edges). They are reasonably comfortable so far, but may start to bug after awhile. Made of stretchy elastic material that may stretch out over time. Also, getting your pants off becomes more complicated, so, you know...plan ahead."
4.0,Works good kind of small
4.0,It’s nice but wish I would have sizes down.  It definitely runs on the big/loose fit side.
4.0,"Nicely-finished hardware. The leather is stiffer than I'd wish, but fine leathers are increasingly difficult to come by. This belt is a good buy."
4.0,"Cute, better than expected."
4.0,"It's a key, it's exactly as described. has a nice weight to it, but the way that the blank fits into the head, i might see that becoming an issue later on, but nothing glue won't fix.<br /><br />the head is pretty awesome though, look at it from different angles and the different sizes come together wonderfully, kind of blending in and creating an optical illusion of different depths.<br /><br />the only thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars is the fact that it's clearly noted that the shank is simply glued into the head. and at $27, might be kind of a steep price, but it's a fairly good quality key, i'd buy more in the future, different colors."
4.0,Bought an extra battery pack for my girlfriend's heated vest.  This was smaller and more powerful than the one that shipped with her vest. She only needed to use this one and thought it provided enough power during our outdoor outings.
4.0,This short is very pretty and I love wearing it.  I do not like what it's made of as I am concerned with pilling and it starting to stick together in a ball leaving wrinkles.  I suggest not drying it.
4.0,First you can easily tell front from back not like some reviewer said<br />Second it's very comfortable and light<br />Finally I removed one star because of the size is taller than normal (sleeves and the shirt it self)<br />I orderd large and I'm gonna order again a medium size cause it worth
4.0,"Love the kilt charm to represent my trip to Scotland, however it was smaller than I thought and I don't understand why the hole wasn't in the other direction like Pandora charms.  Definitely worth the money though."
4.0,"I bought this for my wife because she was looking for a tan or earth tone band.  However, this was much more gold looking than pictured.  Thankfully my wife loves it, but the manufacturer should consider putting up a new image of the band which shows a little more of its true color.  Aside from the color, the quality of the bad seems to be decent for the price paid.  Overall my wife loves this band."
4.0,This shirt fits as expected. It's sheer so you need to wear a tank or Camisole under. It's very light and very thin.
4.0,"These socks are fairly thick, which makes them difficult, if not impossible to wear in shoes that fit well. They are made of all synthetic fibers, so your feet may feel a bit sweaty if you are able to wear them with shoes or boots. They are a bit rough feeling on the outside, but they are very soft and fuzzy on the inside, and seem to stay put better with the cuff turned down. This makes them wonderful to wear around the house. The price is a bit expensive for only one pair of cozy house socks that are not really thermal socks, as stated, and are hard to fit when wearing good fitting shoes, but they would make a nice gift."
4.0,"Super cute, and fit true to size."
4.0,This actually is very pretty on. It sits well around the ankle.
4.0,"Soft and comfortable, fit isn’t great with filter in place for little kids"
4.0,They are super cute an the soles aren't too soft just go a size up the run a lil small
4.0,wifey liked it
4.0,I needed these for a cap extender as new hat I purchased was too small for my noggin.  These worked great and saved a cap that I really liked from becoming a return or a pass along.
4.0,Not very nice fit too tight and no pockets
4.0,"I like it, but I would probably buy a size bigger."
4.0,"Boots are very well made. Exactly as picture.<br />Very good for cosplay. The only problem is the size. I bought for my girlfriend's cosplay and she wear 9. The boots are a bit smaller. Since is an international purchase, it would be cheaper to buy a new one than returning for exchange sizes.<br />We probably are going for a 10 or 11."
4.0,"I use these gloves for riding my motorcycle & they fit & feel great. Nice grip, warm & fits perfect."
4.0,"I ordered this and have only worn it around the house so far. It's super cute, can't wait to wear it to a concert. My only complaint is the buttons along the sleeves make a lot of noise, you can dance and make your own music."
4.0,"When determining your size, the manufacturer has already taken into account the appropriate padding. If you typically wear a large shirt, you can feel confident that a large will fit comfortably over your shoulder and elbow pads"
4.0,"These are very cute and comfortable, but we're large for my little girls feet. She's a small 12 month old and her feet slip around in these. They're very well made and the sock part is soft, just be aware if you have a smaller child, these may be a little too big."
4.0,"Not what I expected, the case for the body is rubber and does not cover the screen. Don't really like the color match but that is a personal preference. Leather band feels great."
4.0,For the price this is a great deal
4.0,"Ordered x-small. It isn't tight at all, which is not what I want, I wanted it to be snug. Its comfortable though, just not what I wanted/needed to workout in. It would be good to smooth things out under clothes, but not helpful when exercising. I feel like it runs big. Was hoping for a much tighter fit. I was able to hook it on the smallest hooks right away."
4.0,This is cute even for larger  Women
4.0,"Cute, but broke as soon as my Granddaughter took of the  package. I fixed it with needle nose pliers. She loved it though. Cute for the price."
4.0,I was pleasantly surprised to receive a quality belt for the price I paid. It was just what I wanted. I only gave it a four star rating because I have not used it yet.Thanks!
4.0,Love the feel and seamlessness of these undies- I can wear the tightest dresses and pants and no worries about panty lines.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are high waisted- I have to fold down the top when I wear them with most of my pants or they show- the waistband goes nearly to maybe an inch below my belly button.
4.0,it's worth no more than the asking price
4.0,We bought the orange pack of 12. Served its purpose as a party favor for my son's 6th birthday party. Based on their size they are made for 4 y/o and below though. Wish the frames were longer. Just barely makes it on my son's ears.
4.0,Niece loved me.
4.0,Bought this steering wheel cover for my husbands 2018 Chevy Colorado truck. Installation was easy and quick. Looks great and protects from the AZ sun. Only thing I noticed is that it is not snug fitting as other covers.
4.0,Nice color.  Nice handbag.
4.0,Great quality shirt for the price $ I fish alot Great for sun protection
4.0,Medium fit great. Comfortable no wrinkle dress. Wore to an outdoor wedding with a pink sweater.
4.0,Product was exactly what was ordered. Great colors and fitsmy little one great.
4.0,Look great- fit as other Doc Martens- heel is cute just wish i could’ve gotten better price but happy otherwise
4.0,Cute but snug.... and when buttoned the bottom kinda stick up.... go up 2 sizes ....Im a large I need an xxl to fit right
4.0,I took a flame and warmed the ends of the clips up enough to curve them so they would not possibly scratch my lens.  I use them with my computer glasses as the screen is too bright.
4.0,"I originally ordered the 8, but they were a little tight in my (y’all) 2.5 year old. So I reordered a 1/2 size up, & they are perfect. I dropped 1 star because there is a very slight heel on them. Totally flat would be better for my little one. But, she LOVES them. Perfect for fairy or princess dress up."
4.0,So it looks exactly like the picture but I put it on a freshly pierced naval and it started irritating me but it’s very cute to wear for those late night shenanigans :)
4.0,"fit was nice and comfortable on the hips, had great movement.."
4.0,"I really like this strap!!..it's sturdy, well made, doesn't stick to your clothing, holds position once adjusted- doesn't slide and it has a pick holder. The only downside is that the pick pocket is too deep; your picks get lost in pocket and difficult to get out. I put a small piece of folded paper in it to make a false bottom - perfect fix to a small problem and strap could be a few inches longer. Otherwise, this is a good quality, well made, secure guitar strap at a good price."
4.0,seems like a good match to the oem band that came on my casio.
4.0,Very comfortable! My only complaint is that the elastic gets twisted.
4.0,"for the price, these sunglasses are great! They feel comfortable, stay on, and serve a good purpose. I like the style and have received compliments. I won't weep when I drop and scratch them as they were under $10.00!"
4.0,They fit; they're a good price. All my cards in just one insert--great.
4.0,the pockets are kind of far back but I like the material and how it fits
4.0,"nice fit, very comfortable"
4.0,"Pants are great but aren't high waisted. Other than that,  they're comfortable and fit well."
4.0,Just wish the straps were black so my makeup don’t get on it :( but it’s still cute. 😄
4.0,"Love it! The pouch may not be quite big enough for some of the larger iPhones but my 6s with its case on fit perfectly. I’m usually a 36 B or C depending on the brand and the M fit well, but I would’ve liked it to be a little tighter for running. Also, it’s padded, so that’s always a pro for a white sports bra."
4.0,So pretty and confortable
4.0,"Just as pictured. Haven’t used them for a long period of time, but it’s definitely heavy. If you are very sensitive with the weight or feeling of the earring pulling a little, don’t buy it."
4.0,looks pretty accurate and i love it! i wish it was bigger though and the strings to tie each end ripped off really easily :(
4.0,"As expected, very nice cap for someone like me who loves Texas & rodeo...<br />The only thing I could say against it is that it doesn’t fit perfectly: a little bit too large... But fits me anyway..."
4.0,"Was skeptical at first about these gloves due to the fries, but after use, they have been great. The only negative is the battery life has shortened over time. But these gloves still keep my hands warm at 4 AM when it’s below freezing"
4.0,"Super cut bag, perfect for my granddaughter! It was quite a bit smaller then I had hoped. She won't be able to use it for long, but none the less, super cute and she loved it."
4.0,I purchased x large several years ago so I tried it again.  This time it was a little too big but I still like the sweatshirt.  The quality is great.  I wear it for excerise so it works just fine.
4.0,"THEY ARE ADORABLE, THEY ARE JUST TOO NARROW FOR ME."
4.0,I purchased these masks for the nose cover. I wear glasses and I’m tired of them fogging up. This mask worked great for that. The fabric was great quality and the colors are vibrant. My only complaint was the that it was hard to breathe. It’s tough because you want the 3 layers of protection but that also makes it a little hard to breathe. Suggestion would be to make the ear loops a little longer so it can be loosened up. Other than that they are great.
4.0,"Nice to find the same pair, albeit different color, of Nike Exofit mid workout shoes on amazon.com. I used to wear these to walk/workout/light running back in the 1980s when these first came out, and they were/are extremely comfortable and provide a stable support system to the foot. Not for heavy-duty running or jogging, but just fine for general wear and working out (weight training, etc.). Recommended!"
4.0,"This is a nice shirt for hot summer days. The material is thin and airy. It's moisture wicking and comfortable for my husband. The fit isn't loose, but it's also not tight. It's in that middle ground. If you're like me and prefer shirts much looser, especially on hot days, I'd recommend going up a size. If you like them super tight, go down. My husband likes it the way it is, though."
4.0,It's good for what it's worth
4.0,I bought this for my daughter and we both loved it. She got the purple and it looked much prettier than what was pictured.
4.0,"All looks and feels great, perfect size.  I like that they are foldable for compact travel.  I am looking forward to using them in my college class Fall 2017 and givings them a final rating.  If all is well, i will buy a few more."
4.0,A really cute summer dress or swimsuit cover up! A bit big in the shoulders but I have small shoulders.
4.0,Very pretty necklace!!
4.0,"I am a hot sleeper, but don't always want to be all natural in bed. These pajamas are perfect because they're light weight, comfy, and cover the basics without feeling too constraining. They are pretty true to size, but would definitely recommend a size up of you want something a bit more ""freeing"". And of course, the mushroom print is super cute! Husband-approved."
4.0,Love my sleep wear. A little larger than my size but its okay..so roomy you can wear it all day when you're home & relaxing. Would buy again & recommend.
4.0,"A bit snug, but overall good"
4.0,Not an expensive piece..nice enough.but finish quality could have been better..ban has casting marks.
4.0,Graphics are great. Ordered a medium and received a large. So far seems durable for my child
4.0,Great poncho
4.0,The Milacolato Small Hoop Earrings are a nice product and they are attractive when worn.  The smallest ones are a little small for an adult but the two larger sizes are nice.  Recommend Milacolato Small Hoop Earrings to potential customers.
4.0,"The dress was great, in many of the colors. Beautiful and comfortable. I did have to get it altered in the chest area to not have myself super exposed though."
4.0,Skirt fit perfect but the top fits kind of small
4.0,Excelent protection for the price!
4.0,The material is nice and comfortable.  I  like the fit.  The only issue is that the collar is not wide enough to go off my shoulder.  I typically wear a large but maybe if I sized up to an XL if would have been better for off the shoulder.  Regardless of that I  do like the romper.
4.0,"I am thrilled to find an attractive vegan clog.  However, I am used to wearing Dansko brand, which fits me so much better.  Sanita does not offer a Wide size (I wish they would!  We don't all have narrow feet!)  Sanita is very tight across the arches compared to Dansko.  I can only hope they stretch out through wear.  Thank you for vegan options!"
4.0,"Gift for granddaughter, she loves it. The quality is not great. But for what I paid for it well worth the money spent"
4.0,Is fine but a little thin and short.
4.0,"Bought them for drives toward sun. They work as expected. Have to tilt head to use the magnified part, I'd like that part to cover a larger area...."
4.0,Simple and elegant. A wonderful fit. Excellent stitching. I would buy this again.
4.0,Nice shinny surface looks pretty but is hard to fasten and unfasten.
4.0,Love love love the first one I had for maybe a year before I had to replace it.. i think it was my fault --I hung a metal medal from it one day and material that holds the clip started to rip .. I had the pink one and got a lot of complement on it.. I just got the black one ... very happy with my purchase !!!
4.0,"Bought this for my 9 year old. Ears, trunk and tail are all proportioned well. The plastic under the fabric for the headband was cracked and broken when it arrived, but we needed the ears for just one night so we made do. The items are more on the cheap side when it comes to quality, but overall a good buy."
4.0,It’s a good dress for the price. The fabric is a bit thin but soft like butter. I am 5’ flat with a big butt and this covers everything and is perfect length. It is very low cut I did stitch it up a bit. I have larger breast so I don’t need them things flopping out! Lol but honestly it’s a perfect date night dress and super flattering.
4.0,"This flows nicely.  It is A LOT of material but the way it's made, it is still flattering without looking sloppy."
4.0,Nice for all kinds of wear.
4.0,This dress is super cute and comfortable the only thing I was disappointed about was that the buttons are just for looks (I’m nursing so was hoping I could wear it and still be able to nurse my baby) but I still kept it and love it I like to wear it out an dates with my hubby.
4.0,"The bottom is not hemmed, it is an open edge which may eventually lead to fraying, but it adds character to the style of the shirt. There is a slight curve to it too so it is not just straight across. It's very light material and a little thin, but feels and looks really good layered."
4.0,"Great for the under $5 price, and a hit with the 10 year old Minecrafting crowd."
4.0,"My grandson loved it. I did however feel it was a bit snug. He is only six years old, but I feel that he won't have long to wear it because it is a bit snug."
4.0,Nice neat product just add extra molding things
4.0,I'm really into mountain biking and have been searching for the perfect pair of sunglasses. This company sent me a pair of sunglasses for free in exchange for my honest review and I accepted. Here's what I think.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ The price is fantastic. $15 is cheap.<br />+ They look good.<br />+ The glasses stick on my head whether I'm running or biking for miles.<br />+ They come with a nice case and cleaning cloths.<br />+ I fell off the bike when wearing these glasses and they not only stayed on my face but didn't get damaged. They seem pretty durable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The polarization isn't the best I've seen. If you look at things at an angle you will see that rainbow effect.<br />- They aren't the most comfortable glasses to wear under my helmet. After wearing them for a couple hours my ears hurt. I'm not sure if this is because my helmet pushes on the glasses but I wear other sunglasses with my helmet that don't have this problem.<br />- Only 1 lens is included. You can't swap out other lenses like other glasses at around $20. The lenses included with these glasses are fairly dark and only work really well in daylight. I would take them off at dawn and dusk because they are too dark.<br /><br />Summary:<br />For $15 these are a good deal. I would recommend them for anyone who want's a dark set of polarized glasses to wear during the middle of the day. They work well for jogging or biking and will not fall off your head.
4.0,"I bought the LARGE - I and am 5'2&#34; 134 lbs - small waist - bigger thighs - 36c chest- Ii usually wear size 31/30, OR 8 (or 7.5 but that's hard to find) in jeans, or medium---and am curvy if that helps<br />These fit me very similar to the picture little snugger in lower waist and front private area - so i would order a size up for sure<br />I like the denim it is well made but soft enough that it doesn't pinch my thighs or rub me wrong"
4.0,Perfect gift for my choker loving friend...who nvr wears any other necklace now except these. Money well spent I suppose. She loves them and looks sexy when she wears them. My friend is happy. I'm happy.
4.0,"Its a cute bag, but the clips on the straps are plastic! So they broke lol just be gentle with it and dont tug on the strap or it'll snap like mine did. I still like this bag very much and its perfect to fit my phone, wallet, battery charger and even a small water bottle. Just replace the plastic clips if you know you might break them on accident!"
4.0,"Like the title says, alittle loose around the neck. Definitely worth the money for a Halloween party!"
4.0,Very pretty but I have big buds so the pleat in front doesn't sit like a pleat and it doesn't sweep the ground. It's long but I was hoping it touched the ground
4.0,Product is fine in fit and performance - but... these days we should know how to make them without tags! Darn thing itches in the back of my neck and had to be cut-off. I expected better! Other wise - good to go!
4.0,Size as describes. Super cute
4.0,"This is a cute dress, with a nice a-line skirt that offers a very flattering sillouette. The top is stretchy tank style and skirt is a mid weight that hangs nicely. Although I'm not sure why it has a zipper. It is stretchy enough I can pull it over my head without issue. And as another reviewer commented, the zip is rather irritating. This is a cute dress and with a little modification to remove the zip and take in the gappy arm holes I think it's a perfect summer dress!"
4.0,"The receiver loves it, though it is a little loose which may get lost if not paying attention."
4.0,"Super cute- and the beads are wood, not plastic. They are individually packaged, which was great for gifts. I gave it “4” bc one was broken."
4.0,This is a really cute dress. Fabric feels good. Sewing is a bit mediocre but for the price overall it's good.
4.0,"Great fit, very comfortable, but a bit long. Will have it altered about 2 inches or so to hit around the knee. The length is a little awkward. I am 5'6."
4.0,"Loved everything about this bikini, I ordered a small fit as expected."
4.0,"These gloves are way too large for children, which was a tad disappointing. My main issue is that I ordered two, and my gloves look entirely different. They aren't similar at all. So I'll never be able to use them for anything other than an adult Michael Jackson costume."
4.0,Looked exactly like the picture and was good
4.0,I really like this pajama set. It's soft and comfortable and it has pockets! I do recommend sizing up as I ordered in my normal size and it's a bit tight.
4.0,Great for holding jewelry.
4.0,The cubii fits well and is easy to transport.
4.0,"It wrinkled a bit after wear, but it's still effective. It's also stretched a little so I can wear it tighter but all in all I love it."
4.0,"Beautiful. Expensive for what it is, but beautiful."
4.0,Super cute for one time wear. The leggings look horrid once you wash them because the black runs into the white.
4.0,Good purchase for the amount but I expected more good quality from brand like that
4.0,"Light weight, have to trim end to fit as it's large for my nose BUT I totally don't mind! I've had these before and tried different brands but always come back."
4.0,I bought this suit a year ago. It fits nicely and conceals the mom bod “problem” middle area. After about a dozen wears the neck tie (halter) became stretched out. The suit itself has held up well and did not fade. I would purchase again.
4.0,"The skirt overall is fine, it’s a bit more flare than I expected and kind of makes it look like I’m wearing a sack"
4.0,"These glasses are absolutely perfect for having a pair of cheap effective sunglasses to wear for particularly patriotic occasions! They fit well, are actually pretty durable and the polarization works well for being under $10. The screws that hold the frame to the arm do come a little loose, but tightening them every now and then fixes that problem easily. Overall, these are cheap, patriotic, and are worth the purchase."
4.0,Granddaughter loves them.  They seem well made for a child's shoe.
4.0,"I'm being an old lady for Halloween so these were the perfect accessorie. The did arrive pretty bent out of shape, but they bent backa nd you can't tell they were messed up. Plus, you have to kind of expect those kind of things when you buy online. Also, I feel like they are a little small."
4.0,"Gloves are nice, good material. Only reason I Gave a 4 is because I consider them mid length not short. These go well above wrists"
4.0,I’m 5’1 and 115lb small is a little see thru for me not sure how I feel about it a medium would of been good size as well. Overall good leggings.
4.0,"Bought one for myself...then a couple for gifts.  Nice looking, functional watch."
4.0,"Nice cap, fits well, but kind of pricey."
4.0,A little larger than expected. It's not as athletic cut as many other items are.
4.0,I like this regardless the red in heart  was almost invisible!!!!
4.0,"We bought these for my daughter, and they fit great!  I thought the plastic wouldn't last, but her last pair lasted for a couple months before she lost one of them.  You can't beat the price if you have a daughter that loses earrings like I lose socks!  Great color assortment too."
4.0,It is a very cute bathing suit.  The top does run a bit small.
4.0,I didn't even know there were beanies that had Bluetooth and a flashlight so when I seen this I snatched it up! When listening to music noone can even hear it outside of the beanie and lasted a good bit! The light is pretty bright! This is one thing that will stay in my work toolbox and come in handy while working this cold season! This would make a great gift for any worker you know!
4.0,"It is a very bright white with a black graphic. It is a very thin material, so my daughter needs to wear something under it. I wish it was a thicker material, but my daughter loves it!"
4.0,"Very easy for the kids (7 & 8 yr olds) to put the belts on by themselves.  Bought for my son and his friends to play at recess, so it was important that they didn't need adult help getting setup. The football is very cheap and got a hole before it was even blown up. But we had plenty of footballs laying around so that wasnt a deal breaker for us."
4.0,"Wallet arrived on time and is exactly as pictured. I like the wallet a lot, the only reason I deducted a star was because the slots on the bottom are difficult to get the cards into and out of. No worries about them sliding out accidentally! I can't attest to the RFID because I didn't test that."
4.0,"Made of thick material so I feel like it will last for years to come.  If it is folded up for long period of time or while hot it will try to hold that form when on your head.  The chin protector can not be centered on your face at all.  I just removed it and wear it below my jaw.  Last point of advise for those it is to big for.  I used backer rod tubing and hot glued some rows in the back of the helmet so that it would sit tighter on my face.  Overall, with a little engineering with getting good fit, this mask can’t be beat for the price."
4.0,"A big watch (51mm) without being clunky, and that's important if you have a small wrist like I do. Lots of useful functions, especially for out wandering around - altimeter, Barometer, compass, Temperature. It's a real plus since it is solar powered and atomic, water resistant to 330ft (100m).  My only complaint is that band is not blue like it appears in the picture."
4.0,"I like these bracelets, but they are for kids. Super bright colors. Super easy to put it on and out. Very light weighted. It will be a good idea for a gift. :)<br />The strap can be adjusted very small or large."
4.0,"The graduation stole was beautiful and vibrant, just like the pictures! However, the material of the stole was weird. It wasn’t like a traditional stole that can easily lay on your shoulders with your tassels. This stole felt stiff and I had to keep adjusting it throughout graduation. Regardless, I received so many compliments on my gorgeous stole!"
4.0,This dress is a nice buy. However the size you will need to go up the next size to meet the size fit in the U.S.. I ordered a large which is equivalent to an 8-10. The color is the same as the picture.
4.0,Cute dress just a little too long for me but I'm short. Nice material.
4.0,"good design, not bad fabric - normal item"
4.0,I have gotten tons of compliments with this dress. Plus it's very comfortable.
4.0,Easy to apply. Nice cream base
4.0,"The fit overall is spot but things like the knuckle holes that don't line up at all is a bit disappointing, hence the four stars.  Definitely appreciate the touchscreen ability."
4.0,The material is soft but the cut of the neckline is a bit awkward. Overall a good value
4.0,"Very nice, but the sleeves are extremely small. I heard a stitch break in the sleeve when I tried to take it off. And my biceps are 12&#34; around."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this dress. I got it to wear to a wedding. It does run small , I normally wear a 2X/3X and ordered the 4X and it fit but I kind of wish I would've ordered the 5X for a little more flow and it was a smidge tight on the waist area but not enough for me to return it or not wear it . The fit is the only reason I have it 4 stars and not 5 , if I wouldn't have looked at other reviews I would've ordered my normal size and it would definitely have been too small. So , order one or two sizes up depending on how you like it to fit and you'll be good !"
4.0,"My expectations weren’t quite met. I love the cushioning from the height of the heel but the inside “fleece” is not very good. I’m disappointed with the lining. If they improved the inside lining, then they’d have a sure winner."
4.0,I like the rich color and I get compliments at work.  It is practical but pretty.  Some of my coworkers always tell me to give a twirl when I wear it.  It does do a cute twirly kind of thing without being a really full or pleated skirt dress.
4.0,I bought these in good faith and was rewarded. The 36C was a perfect fit.  The bras are comfortable and pretty. Not high end but that is not what I was expecting. Loving them.
4.0,It's pretty and fit well.
4.0,This product was very sturdy but not stretchy. After a little the metal started to come off. Other than that it was a great product! It was a great small lanyard.
4.0,I was surprised that the quality surpassed my expectations . I am very pleased with my new bag.
4.0,This is a nice jacket however it is a little small for a 2XL. I ordered the 2XL because I like things to be more on the baggy side. It is not too small but it is smaller than I would prefer. Maybe I should have ordered the 3XL. Overall it is comfortable and warm. I would recommend ordering a larger size than usual.
4.0,It’s nice fit warm good for night out
4.0,"LOVE this outfit. It is very flattering and cute, but one word of advice; it is very cheaply made. I wore it twice before the pants ripped. Granted, I was dancing in them but they fit loosely so it shouldn't have been an issue. For the price, it is a great deal so if you rip your pants, just buy a new pair!"
4.0,It's an attractive visor.  But I just wish it had a tighter fit. If I don't have sunglasses on it won't stay up.
4.0,"Contents were good, but not enough quantity.  Maybe I had tooo much popcorn?"
4.0,"This was cute and comfy, but I felt like it was a tad too short for me.  I am 5'10"" with long legs, so it was just a bit higher than I wanted.  Still cute, but because I already have another dress the same length and color I decided to return this one.  I might get another in a different color though, because it is very cute."
4.0,I felt like Dana White had signed me up for the ultimate fighter whenever this package had arrived. It is very beautiful and very sturdy leather necklace the only complaint I have about it at all is it takes a little bit of time to get all of the kinks out of it. Other than that the packaging was great the shipping was quick and I would highly recommend this to any UFC fans!
4.0,Good quality silk mixed with cotton polo shirt.  It looks dressy yet casual enough to wear with jeans or dress pants.  The fit is nice and feels smooth and soft on the body.
4.0,I ordered the dress in large. It does fit but the front is too  close to my body and causes my stimach to be<br />Pronounced. I ordered the extra large and it looks and feels better with little more room around the middle. I intend to wear to a wedding in hot wearher. I sppreciate the high neck as I had surgery on my neck--A stylish way to cover it. The open sleeves  are neat and doesn't show off anything but my arms. I really<br />Like it and so did my daughter when i tried it on.
4.0,The material is very soft to touch and fits perfect .<br />Wish the Robe came with loops to keep tying belt in place
4.0,Like this hat too. Fits great
4.0,I love this dress! It is well worth the price. I read the reviews before hand and ordered a size up and it fits like a dream. Fabric is nice and not scratchy. As a fuller figure woman this is one of the few dresses that is not too tight across my chest. I plan on wearing this to a fall wedding.
4.0,Very pretty pieces at a great price!  I will definitely purchase from this designer again!
4.0,"The larger frame size and foam padding work well for keeping the wind out of you eyes. The transition lenses are pretty good, but it would be nice if the tint was a little darker."
4.0,Does anyone know how to work the clasp on this swimsuit? I love it but can’t figure out the clasp!
4.0,Reusable mask.
4.0,Cute felt hat. 4 stars for it is a bit small and wrinkled. I steamed some of the wrinkles out by putting it on my wig head and gave it some steam blasts from my iron. Not asl came out.
4.0,"These shorts are really nice. They are a comfortable fabric and go to my knees (I'm 5'6). Be mindful of the sizes though because they run small. I originally ordered XXL, but they fit like a large. I ordered XXXL then and they fit great!"
4.0,It serves the purpose. The fit is good. I ordered it a size bigger because I want to have it loose.
4.0,Great bag- fits my child's skates perfectly. Seems pretty durable. If you have larger sized adults skates I recommend looking for a different bag as they probably won't fit.
4.0,Love the flow of this but the waistband could be much more comfortable.
4.0,"great bracelet, a little bit of a pain to adjust but not bad, looks nice"
4.0,very cute. Put on a better quality chain and gave it to a friend who loves cats as a gift. She loved it
4.0,"I love it (clearly with 5 stars) - gift from hubby :). It came nicely packaged. It is a true medium bag that will hold essentials - coming from one who loves to carry lots of stuff. Nice quality and nicely made - classic looking. Not disappointed - it is as it appears in the pictures.It has form and shape without being too hard and will stand up without falling over even when empty.<br /><br />I am one to stick with one bag until it goes so I hope I get a year out of it. I carry it mostly in the crook of my arm; when I do put it on my shoulder it is snug and a little awkward due to the strap length, in particular, if the bag is full; I am not a fan of the shoulder (attachable) strap that came with it so I don't use it.<br /><br />Update: July 28, 2017<br /><br />Happy user until everyday use of the bag over less than 6 months caused the straps to start breaking by the metal loops, mostly from the weight of Mommy things 😃......sigh🙁. If you really like the bag I would still recommend it but it is clearly not suitable for the wear and tear of everyday use. Deduct 2 stars."
4.0,Great for after cateract surgery!  Love them for ATV riding keeps the wind and dust out of eyes.  Nice fit and light weight.
4.0,I love it even if it’s a little snug. Fun shirt!
4.0,Smaller than what I expected but love the colors!
4.0,to shut an umbrella takes a lot of time<br />but it's cute
4.0,"This pair of sunglasses is stylish and fashionable. It has the design of high end and branded sunglasses. I chose the blue color with gold metal frame and I like how the colors complement each other making it look so elegant and expensive. It has a sleek design and lightweight. I could barely feel it while wearing it. The fit is perfect for me and it felt comfortable even after wearing it for a long time. It stays in place so well that I wasn't bothered at all while moving around. I'm just not too impressed with the frame because it was too thin that I feel like it can easily be bent or broken but for the price, it is a really good deal. Unlike others who purchased this sunglasses, mine did not come with a hard case. It just came with a drawstring bag so just giving a heads up to those who might be expecting a hard case with it. Overall, I would recommend this sunglasses for those seeking an affordable and stylish sunglasses.<br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. These statements are solely my opinion and are based on my experience using the product."
4.0,I absolutely love this top! Super cute and comfy!
4.0,"Nice small bag for carrying some papers, small note pad, and an ipad in. If you looking for something to carry binders, multiple large folders, etc, this isn't the bag you want. Seems well constructed and sturdy. Been using the bag now for about 2 months and only downside I have noticed is the material it is made of, has not softened up yet. If left in an awkward position for an extended period of time, it will bend to that shape and you have to straighten everything back out. Would recommend though."
4.0,"Beautiful pair of earings. Packing was good, and the quality also seems to be nice. It sure does sparkle. Exactly what I wanted for everyday use. I think its worth the price."
4.0,Watch bands met all expectations.  Great price too
4.0,If she likes it I like it
4.0,"Only issue was the strap doesn’t stay latched in the hole unless you have it on the tightest option. Looks in person just like in the images. They only had size large but I was fine with that, I wanted to layer underneath for more head protection while snowboarding."
4.0,I'm usually a small size but i took my time to read the reviews and i ended up buying a medium size and it fits great. The top is still a little tight but not to the point of feeling choked up. It holds everything where it should be. The head hole is a little bit too small though. I still think it looks great. The color are brigth and pretty. Got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I received the bracelet quicker than expected, & like that it comes in a gift box. It's so on trend with what I've seen teens & young women wearing lately! My only concern/complaint is that the braided band on the bracelet is a tad shorter than the other 2 straps, so I hope it still lays properly on the wrist....since it's adjustable, I imagine it won't be an issue"
4.0,"I wore this for my graduation. It fit me well and even though my medal kept getting caught up in the material of the dress, it served its purpose."
4.0,"It's very pretty, but a bit thinner than I expected."
4.0,It is shorter than expected
4.0,"Very cute , soft Mask !!! I really liked them, The only problem was when i put it on the thread to eye part broke off and the masks kinda smell , badly ."
4.0,"The product is of good quality, shipping was on time, will refer friends."
4.0,"I normally wear a size medium with a bust measuring 32D, but based on reviews I ordered a small. The first peplum top I received was defective. The back panel wasn't sewn to match the front and the elastic waist was broken. Since I loved the color (true to photo) and material (very soft without being thin), I requested a replacement. Now with no defects, the top is cute and flattering. It's soft and drapes nicely. Hint: if you don't want to look pregnant, make sure you order the correct size. After a quick investigation, the top is made in China and it doesn't have a tag indicating the fabric content or washing instructions. My plan is to launder on gentle cycle in a hosiery bag and either tumble dry with no heat or lay flat. (Hopefully that will be a safe option.) Reviews for this item seem to be all over the board and I think it's because fabric content and sizing may vary which is unfortunate."
4.0,"I have a size 8 fitted hat head (legitimately) and Fatheadz are the only sunglasses, other than Oakley Monster Dogs, that fit. And, at this price, you cannot go wrong. They are plastic, and don't feel like they will last a lifetime, but I am satisfied with what I bought, what I paid, and how they fit my big ole head."
4.0,This is my fiancé’s favorite necklace! He made a different chain out of parachord though
4.0,"I wear a lot of silicon rings, it's nice to have fun options. Its nice and slim, some of these are really fat. It has slots on the inside to let your skin get some air. Good crisp detail on the design. Would be nice if the edges were rounded."
4.0,The neckline is adjustable in the sense that you are able to wear it so that it shows a hint of your shoulder (appropriate for work) or you can bring it down fully showing one or both shoulders (amping up the sexy/cute factor).  It fits as expected with the longer loose sleeves and longer length of the sweater covering your bum. Stunning color (I ordered blue) and very soft!
4.0,Really pretty! But not true to size it runs a little big.
4.0,It’s just fine
4.0,"I ordered this thinking it was a romper, so that's on me, but it's actually super cute. Definitely thin, but great for a weekend summer dress or even a swimsuit cover up. The pattern placement caused mine to have one black shoulder strap and one cream colored shoulder strap, so I MAY try ordering again to see if I get two that match next time. But overall this is a cute casual dress."
4.0,Very small<br />Took forever to get here<br />It is very cute but the zipper broke after a couple of weeks using it
4.0,Products will work for what I need. Was a good value and fast delivery.
4.0,"These compression socks are comfortable, fit well, and give good support. And they are cute. I have already bought them more than once!"
4.0,Fit my face okay
4.0,"I really like it, however the straps are a little too long and fall oft the shoulder.  If you're a tall girl this might fit you a lot better."
4.0,"I bought this belt out of nostalgia. When I was a kid, my entire family would watch Saturday morning wrestling. Harley Race, Ric Flair, and the American Dream, Dusty Rhodes all wrestled for this belt. Mostly everything is spot on. But the flags of Mexico and Japan are not level/straight. Minus 1 star. Truth be told, this was bought STRICTLY for the fond memories of the family all together back in the day. Brings a smile to my face when I see it, despite the mentioned flaws. Also, it doesn't come with a carrying case or bag, but it doesn't say that it does. This is the only strap I've ever wanted because of the memories. I would NEVER buy another wrestling belt of any kind. I am by no means a collector who fantasizes they are an actual wrestling champion.  Haven't been a fan or watched since the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin days."
4.0,"The swimsuit is cute. Just like pictured I have to say. The issue is. It is hard to order online. You never know what country an outfit is from. I am a med/ size eight in the us. So I ordered a large of this. it won’t even go over my big butt. So I’m guessing this is made in china which means I needed an extra-large I think. No worries I will probably fit it in the winter lol when I don’t need it. I don’t care this is still a good buy cause my weight changes so much I will wear it sometime. When I start chemo back I will be back to a size six and it will probably fit lol. This is still a good gift idea . I think you would like it just remember to order a size or two up.<br />I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is one hundred percent my own opinion. No monetary compensation was received and I was not required to write a positive review. If you have found this review to be helpful, please mark it as such in the feedback section. Thank you and have a wonderful day.  "
4.0,Very cute great quality ran a size small. Order a size up.
4.0,Super cute for the price. Put one on and it broke right away but there’s plenty to choose from since you get a bunch of them. Will last a summer
4.0,"These boots arrived today and they are gorgeous.  Unfortunately, I have to send them back tomorrow.  I ordered a 10 1/2 (toddler), and they are not any bigger than the 9 and a half he just outgrew.  When we measured the soles, these boots were the same length as his old ones, and the pointed toe makes them even smaller (his old boots were square toe)...  I'd recommend ordering at least one full size larger.  On a good note, the boots seem to be a well made, solid boot and they look even better in person!  For that reason, I give them 4 stars."
4.0,"It is quite large, larger than my usual pieces I GI for but I love it nonetheless. I am however planning to get a longer and nicer chain, not that the one that comes with this is particularly terrible, it's just not what I want. It is very lovely especially for the price."
4.0,"I wanted a very small, automatic, brightly colored umbrella to cheer me up on rainy days.  Couldn't find it anywhere on Amazon, so I got this.  It is black on the underside, which is definitely not cheery.  Otherwise, it is an excellent umbrella.  I haven't used it on a windy day yet, so I can't testify to its wind-hardiness, but otherwise it is excellent.  Smooth open and close.  Fits in my purse nicely.  Good size.  A bit heavier than most, but ok."
4.0,Very cute but was a little big.
4.0,"The sizing was perfect, you ask for a small, you get a small. You ask for a large, you actually get a large. It's not one if those wonky sizing charts. On the other hand the texture is very odd. It's like a sheet of foam on your body. I very much dislike the texture but otherwise it's a great sweatshirt."
4.0,Not very  stretchy material but still feel soft. Its a thin flannel fabric in the inside and smooth on the outside. If you like a roomy sweater go up 2 sizes.
4.0,Great props item.
4.0,"I bought these no show socks for my husband who wears a size 9 shoe.  However, I have ended up wearing them!  The only reason I gave these four stars is because they don't fit my husband.  He can get them on, but they are tight and uncomfortable.  They fit me perfectly(I wear a size 8 1/2 in women's) and I love them!  They are very comfortable and don't slip down on my feet, no matter how long I wear them.  They have a silicone grip on the heel that keeps them in place.  They are made of bamboo and are breathable.  I like that they are really no show, you can't see them at all when you wear them. These are very comfortable socks and I am very happy with them.  My only issue with them is that they run small.  I got these socks at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,"Only complaint is it does run big.  Other than that, very comfortable and super warm.  Definitely a winter or fall robe.  The blue looks nice."
4.0,They are fine. Bought them to use as eczema wet sleeves but wasn’t a good idea
4.0,The item is inexpensive but it works. It is fairly sturdy but eventually fell apart.
4.0,"This band was stylish and comfortable. Alas, it was too long and I had to return it. If it came in a smaller size, or if it could be adjusted, I'd buy it in a second. It's adorable."
4.0,These socks were much smaller than expected. Because of this I had to return them.
4.0,I get compliments on these cuff links.
4.0,"Leaves quite a bit of lint, but otherwise a great scarf."
4.0,"I purchased four sets of these as a gift for my bridesmaids. I was a little nervous about the quality, considering the price. When they arrived, I immediately looked at all four sets and wasn't disappointed! There are a few blemishes, but that's a quality that most pearls have, and the blemishes can only be noticed if one is looking closely for them. I am perfectly pleased with this purchase, and I am sure that my girls will love them too!"
4.0,"Have used these goggles about 6 times now to swim laps, and for the most part they have delivered as promised.  I really like the expansive view they give as compared to other standard goggles that really compress your field of vision.  The only deficiency has been intermittent small amounts of water sneaking in, but it hasn't been anything too bothersome; anti-fog coating works well so far."
4.0,"bought these for my bridal party and daughters for our wedding.  Some were broken upon arrival and replaced quickly and easily, free of charge.  They're really cute, but the cross often slips out of the infinity symbol, leaving the necklace hang open in the front."
4.0,Delicate. Wife loved it bc our daughter's name is Rose.
4.0,Great price for a nice sweatshirt. Fits well and washes up nicely.
4.0,It is really cute and can be worn only on game day and still add a fun pop. Great for any football mom who just wants to represent in style.
4.0,SUMAJU big charms Drop Tassel Fringe Wood Beaded Enamel collar statement  Necklace came nicely packed without any damage.This necklace has got the unique design and it is a perfect accessory to your outfit in wedding and engagement parties etc. This necklace is made of wood and resin alloy metal
4.0,"I like this cardigan a lot, it has a very unique look to it and is very soft.  However, it is very sheer so wearing it for warmth is not practical, but wearing it for style is.  It hangs nicely on my body - 5'9"", 148 pounds.  I will be wearing it more this Spring when it's not so cold."
4.0,Very comfortable. Cute
4.0,"It’s a pretty top, fit well and not too big or flowy - I have 36DD and usually large tops are too bulky/not flattering- this is great!"
4.0,these are truly cute.<br />I have two concerns though:<br />1) the label says 100% cotton -- no way it this is true. it has a LOT of synthetic fabric in it.. it would be nice to have an honest label!<br />2) due to colorful design the inside of the sock is a mess of dangling thread ends which will tangles in your toes each time you put them on.
4.0,"Very cute, but it runs a bit small. Really hope it doesn't shrink!"
4.0,Cute shirt!!  Love wearing with yoga pants.
4.0,Very nice bag! I wish it would be a little bigger but I am definitely pretty happy with my order. Thanks!
4.0,Love the pockets and the high waist. They are great during my crossfit workouts. I bought a L and XL not knowing how the sizing is. The XL doesn’t support/contain my belly and love handles as well.
4.0,generously cut but easy to wear and clean.
4.0,Great product. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 star is because I wish it were one buttonhole longer.
4.0,"very pretty, a tiny bit small, but lightweight"
4.0,Went up about two sizes in order to have it fit properly. Then it's cute for what it is.
4.0,"Got this for my son, he likes as they are very comfortable, the only complaint would be they roll up a bit under his uniform."
4.0,"Very nice, very slimming style, fabric is nice."
4.0,"Pixel Jewelry 1985 - Fashion Women Moon Star Shape Crystal Rhinestone Stud Ear Earrings Stud<br />These whimsical earrings are just adorable. I purchased 4 pair. Last night I wore one pair and brought another pair with me. Midway through the night I asked my girlfriends if they liked them. They thought they were super cute and asked where they could get them. I pulled out the extra pair and gave them to one friend and then gave the ones out of my ears to the other friend!!<br /><br />I really like that the moon shapes are a separate piece and can be interchanged with other post earrings that I own. And, that there are two lengths for the moon drops (see pictures). I also like that the stars can be worn separate.<br /><br />The differences from the ones advertised are the stars. They are a flat enamel green star. There is no dimension and only one color. Not quite like pictured.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01681G9SQ Pixel Jewelry 1985 - Fashion Women Moon Star Shape Crystal Rhinestone Stud Ear Earrings Stud]]"
4.0,Really good posters but when you put tape on it and try to move it off it rips the poster slightly. But over all the quality and size was really good.
4.0,"Like the bands at the wrists, the good size of the hood"
4.0,Got the for my Granddaughter they loved them.
4.0,"I have bought this item -- Ralph Lauren Flat Front Wool Dress Pants -- before, and I am satisfied with the pants.  The pants fit well and the material drapes just fine.  Only one minor problem: the hemming on the left side of pants came loose and, naturally, required repair.  Otherwise, I would recommend buying this pair of pants."
4.0,"Pretty dress love the collar, it's  too big, my friend  will fix it for me."
4.0,"The fit is good considering its adjustable, only had it a couple of days seems sturdy."
4.0,"Bought it for myself, and felt like they were too big for my face and too plastic-y. Gave it to a friend and she wears it all the time."
4.0,Loving my belt. It is better than I expected. Very happy. Recommend it.
4.0,Everyday use. Very comfortable.
4.0,Love they are small and easy.
4.0,"Cheap chain, but the pendent itself looks awsome"
4.0,"This is the first binder I've ever bought as I am expermenting with my gender. I have to say it does binder pretty well. I found my postour was better too. I am a DDD cup so I ordered a Large. The size chart is correct. Around my chest it wasn't tight or felt sufficating. It was only tight around my collarbones and under my chest. This made it especially hard to take on and off. I could also see my nips through the binder. I don't see this as a negative though because it makes it breathable. It did leave red marks under my stomach and near my collarbone. I found that it made my stomach flatter which was a plus. I do say it helps with my insecurties with having a huge chest. When I put on a T-shirt I felt more comfortable and proper. I would recommend this binder to someone starting out because it's cheap and binds well. Overall, get this binder if you are starting out."
4.0,the bottoms were see through and the top was a bit big. i just wear the top with black bottoms now.
4.0,I like the fact that it is adjustable. Just enough bling.
4.0,"Works well for my very large almost two year old. However, my seven year old doesn’t have a ton of room."
4.0,This is a very nice set. It’s a little heavy and bulky for me. Returned.
4.0,Bought these socks to sleep in at night while camping. I love the warmth and feel of these socks. The price is great. The only con is one sock is noticeably bigger than the other. But again I only wear them to sleep in.
4.0,I broke them a month later but I was glad I was able to pay for my glasses and was able to get a deal. I recommend to all my friends to buy their frames online now when they break.
4.0,"This product works great. I work in a jail and as a bailiff for court. My duty belt would start to sag and every time I pulled it up my shirt came with it. Tired of looking like a soup sandwich I ordered these to keep my shirt tucked in. No surprise, they work. Here is the issues I have had with them. They start to hurt my calf, shin, anywhere I clamp it on my socks after about nine hours of work. So I move them around during my twelve hour shifts, solves that problem. I have one that now rusts against my leg and leaves little brown squares right at my sock line as I move it around during my shift. Not what I was expecting after just a few months of use. That problem will be fixed with clear nail polish. Bottom line, they're not the greatest shirt keepers, but they work well and do what they claim."
4.0,Very well at sun protection! Easy to wear and not too heavy. Able to wear regular glasses with it. But too much reflections that are very disturbing to the driver! Not sure safe to drive with it on!
4.0,"Holds really well, but slightly uncomfortable due to bulkiness of the clasp. In addition I wear in between a pair of socks because they rub your skin, but look bad if worn outside the socks. I'm making them work and are much more reliable than the rubber clasps that always come undone."
4.0,"Definitely order up a size. I’m 5’6”, athletic build, 145 pounds. I usually order mediums and I ordered a large based on the sizing ratings. It’s a nice dress with a nice, tight fit."
4.0,Very cute.  I am size 4 and got XS do runs a little big.
4.0,"very cute, if it was lined it would look about 10 times more expensive.  very nice hat."
4.0,"I love this dress, but the fabric definitely feels a little cheap. But it's a cute dress, and comfortable, and it arrived very quickly so those are definitely positives."
4.0,"3 of the 4 items are perfect. The 4th has an area that is frayed where the top meets the bust. Manufacturing defect but packaging is clear, I would've hoped QC would notice before shipping."
4.0,A gift for my sister
4.0,"Seemed well made but the gold was too shiny and cheap looking for my taste, but I can see this appealing to someone else. Just wasn't my taste so I returned it."
4.0,"These glasses are just as good as other glasses that are way more expensive. It would be wise to purchase these now before they catch on, and the price goes up."
4.0,"I have a bigger head, so this is a little tight, but I wouldn't say it's excessively small. It's a really great quality hat-- soft and flexible, but the wire helps keep the brim in place."
4.0,I loved the blazer until I had to wash it. It’s very finicky fabric and needs to be ironed. That is the only reason for 4/5 also I am typically an XL size in tops
4.0,They're warm stylish in two for the price of one can't beat it.
4.0,Love the hat.  Had to exchange it for a bigger size.
4.0,My daughter enjoys them
4.0,These disposable boot covers fit over shoes or boots very easily and stay up all the while that they are worn.  They keep your feet and shoes or boots totally dry.
4.0,Beautiful rose gold necklace!
4.0,"Better price than Ridge wallets, great value."
4.0,"I liked appearance and softness.  But in 30 degree weather, my hands got cold fairly quickly."
4.0,Nice band. Leather is a little shiny but good quality and color looks like what is shown on website. It is not a wide or as long as the original stone color band but fits my wife's smaller wrist very nicely. Didn't have any problem changing the band but I also used tool I had received from another Moto 360 band purchase. YouTube video was very informative on how to swap out the new band.
4.0,I’m impressed with the quality of these bracelets &  they’re absolutely cute<br /><br />UPDATE 2 of my bracelets broke in 1 week -<br />I’m on my 3rd one now.  The type of material used doesn’t allow for knots and I think that’s the problem.  The bracelets are always lose
4.0,Awesome fit and very flattering!
4.0,I love this shirt! It's so cute and the material is good quality
4.0,"Not quite as wide as I would have hoped; however, are wider than any of the rack-types I've found in my area."
4.0,"The first thing we noticed about this belt is that it's very blue, however the more it's worn it's starting to look more brown. Also, It could be a little longer, with one or two more holes.<br /><br />Overall, this belt is nice. Made of thick strong leather, and should last a long time."
4.0,"This is so sexy, but the shorts are veeeeeeeeerrry short. It's a good thing the outer layer can help cover your lap while sitting! Otherwise, super sexy and comfortable. I love the see through top, and the colors are exactly as pictured."
4.0,"It is comfortable, water resistant, has all of the features that I need and is a good watch for ten bucks.<br />It gains a few seconds a day but.is reasonably accurate."
4.0,It was great for the concert but it stat unraveling by the end of it. Very stylish but can be better.
4.0,Loved the pockets on this top. It is not as warm as a sweatshirt but all and all a nice top
4.0,It is as advertised - a valet WSU key chain.  The finish is nice and it feels like a solid keychain.  What more is there to say?  It's a keychain.
4.0,"Great quality, well packaged, and great customer service.  It does run small as most reviews mention.  M/L is more like a true Medium."
4.0,"So I’m only giving a 4 star rating because the watch isn’t waterproof. Other then that I absolutely love it. It’s super cheap, and so pretty!"
4.0,They're nice belts for the price
4.0,I bought for my teenager soon. It fits like an evening dress but he will grow out of it...
4.0,it does its job just fine but i have to warn anyone considering this product especially if you are trying to slim down (i feel that this will affect them more) the zipper slips down a little and can pinch
4.0,"Some what small; however, i will drop off around my waist line. Alliswell!"
4.0,Beautiful dress. The fabric on the straps is not even. It appears to have been stitched wrong. The straps are a bit long for me as well. Adjustable straps would have been preferred. Otherwise beautiful dress and good material.
4.0,When I first got these I wasn't too sure about them.  I'm a small woman and have trouble finding compression socks for a size 6.  I need the 20-30 compression.  When I first put these on I was surprised at how easy they went on.  Not near the struggle I have with my other compression socks.  And they fit perfect in the foot for my small feet.  The heal sat exactly where it should.  However the length was LONG.  I could have stretched them above my knees.  But I didn't.  And I realized they smoothed out very well once in place.  No wrinkles that can cause problems with circulation.  But since they were so easy to put on I wondered if I had the right compression.  So I wore them for the day to see how my legs did.  By the end of the day I noticed the compression did the job.  No leg swelling.  And they were easier to remove then my other compression socks.  I was so impressed that I bought more pairs.  I would definitely recommend these socks to others.  Especially if you have trouble finding small sizes.
4.0,This is a pretty bracelet but it kind of hurts by wrist bone sometimes.  I think I would prefer a chain type bracelet.
4.0,"Good weight to it, doesn’t feel cheap. However the square shape isn’t perfect. If you’re just hanging them from your car though it isn’t an issue"
4.0,"It DID fit as expected, but only because I ordered a size up, so it was too large for me ;). Perhaps other reviewers had a different batch? Mine is roomy enough that my preschooler asks to climb into it WITH me, and fits just fine - cute and funny, but if I had purchased this myself (it was a gift from my husband, though we share an Amazon account,) I would have returned it for a size down. Roomy and plenty long for my gangly arms and legs for either size, I suspect.<br /><br />I really love the gown - I like the 'sexy grandma' style, perfect to wear early Christmas morning as it is modest, and made of cotton that feels soft and lived in after just a couple of washes. Whether worn ironically or for classic comfort and modest style, this is lovely.  It is also available at a considerably lover price point (depending on vendor,) than other similar gowns from other companies such as Salzburg.<br /><br />The cotton was opaque, which was a nice, since other gowns I have in this style are too sheer to wear alone, and can be uncomfortably warm as a result.<br /><br />Tip: watch for sales and check different sellers and vendors as this and other similar gowns vary in price greatly.  I put a price alert on some items, and recommend that for any item that you truly wish to purchase but can wait for."
4.0,It fits perfectly for the cost.
4.0,"I removed a star. My first purchase is amazing and I love it,  so I ordered another one! My second order came 2 or 3 sizes too small.  I was heavily disappointed.  Returned with no problems though.  I'm considering ordering another because it is truly a gorgeous buy.  One of my favorites to wear.<br /><br />I ordered a large"
4.0,"A nice goggle. I've been using them in the open water for a couple of weeks, about 6x for a couple of hours each time. Comfortable, and no leaking. I didn't use anti-fog until the 4th swim. They are very crisp clear vision. I have the pink ones and swam in the morning and evening with the sun glare not a problem. I'm kinda goggle junky so couldn't pass the good deal up and I'm glad I did. I'd pay full price for these as an open water goggle. In the pool I prefer swedes."
4.0,This dress is really form fitting.
4.0,"The picture makes the design look like it's black and white, but it's white and brown. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this project. Fits very nice."
4.0,True to size. Fit as expected.
4.0,Gave it to my teacher for Christmas/ end of semester and she loved it
4.0,"i love the jacket and wear it a lot, but i was expecting the Hanako picture to fill the back and it barely took up any space. :("
4.0,Purchased as a gift.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Looks great.<br />2. Came with a bonus bracelet.<br />3. Comfortable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It's stretchy but is really made for smaller wrists.
4.0,"Cute skirt, runs small so order up"
4.0,one of the bands got broken when applied it - there are small metal pieces - it was torn on the first try...
4.0,"These have a nice color and good posts. They look well, and the texturing of  the earrings is easy to see without actually feeling rough to the touch.  Reasonable in weight."
4.0,Very cute but slightly big.
4.0,I love the glasses very good for the price.
4.0,"it fits good, just on the smaller side, if you're about to grow out of a medium, definitly switch over to a large."
4.0,I like the blues in this versatile anorak. It’s just the right fit—not too<br />Narrow or wide.
4.0,"I'm happy to add this sweater to my fall and winter wardrobe. I like almost everything about it. I love the color. It's vibrant and matches most of my jeans and slacks. I like the Vneck. It's looks great with a dainty necklace.<br /><br />This sweater has a high/low bottom. It's higher in the front and drops lower in the back. This is great for covering some of my back side. I like this feature of the sweater.<br /><br />I'm picky about sweaters as I have sensitive skin and a lot of them are too scratchy for me. I don't have that problem with this sweater. It's soft enough that it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />The only thing I wish were better on this is the sizing. I normally wear a medium which is what I received in this. It's just a little on the big side. For those who like their sweaters baggy, it's not a big deal. When I gave it a second look on the model, I noticed it looked a bit baggy on her too so I assume it's supposed to fit this way. It won't stop me from wearing it though. Overall, I'm happy to have this color of sweater and anticipate I will wear it often."
4.0,My daughter loves this hat! The only complaint I have is that the brown &#34;hair&#34; is thin.  This was a replacement because the other ones ripped in half.
4.0,"I love this dress. Unfortunately, it fit perfectly out of box but shrunk when washing. Going up a size would have been perfect."
4.0,Super adorable on both my girls “3 & 5 years old”<br />Stretchy enough yet tight enough to stay up without slipping off their legs
4.0,"I ordered a large and she usually wears a medium. It fit well but when she lifts her arms it feels a little short in the legs. It’s a little Puffier in looks than the model picture, but that’s fine. It’s warm and has lots of pockets and suspenders so it won’t fall down."
4.0,"quality seems very nice, it was appreciated by the giftee.  got a small 4&#34; or 5&#34; tall vase to put it in."
4.0,"I received this set as a birthday gift, and I'm in love. The material is very soft and comfortable, but I did notice the lent balls in the thigh area by the end of the day. I'm 5'10, and this was tall girl friendly. I want to order more, but the colors I would order are not available (navy blue, brown, tan, maroon). I received an XL, but totally could have done a large"
4.0,Great fit my second hat
4.0,Seems to run a little on the small size in the toe length.
4.0,"Very nice, my grand daughter loves it."
4.0,Easy too put on and off but not as sturdy as my more expensive pair.
4.0,"Very light weight, super comfortable, but durable?  I don't know yet -- stay tuned"
4.0,I liked the item but it ran extremely small.
4.0,"I love them. But, the blue plastic that was put around them stuck to it and left residue on them. All in all I lvoe them"
4.0,"Very nice.  A soft lace, not one of the plastic feeling ones.  Skirt is a trifle short,  especially for the J Lo sort of well-endowed women."
4.0,works against nighttime glare as I wished
4.0,Super cute and light weight top! It fits as expected and is very flattering. My only complaint would be that it doesn't stay in place. I have to tug the front down often as it rides up. Maybe because it's longer and heavier in the back? The seam that goes under your boobs doesn't actually do anything to keep the shirt in place so as it rides up that seem ends up across my boobs instead of under. But for the price I don't mind pulling it down.
4.0,Great looking but run a little big.
4.0,It fit for the most part but the velcro waist band folds over when moving around and becomes uncomfortable. I have just a belly/back supporting waist trainer and it both zips and velcros and holds much better.
4.0,Quite bigger than expected but it looks nice
4.0,Decent enough pocket squares.  A little smaller than I hoped but a decent selection of colors and patterns.
4.0,Looks like the photo. The top fit as expected but the bottoms are quite tight.
4.0,Bought this to workout in. It is long enough and at the length I want for a shirt to workout at the gym.
4.0,"These were for my girlfriend. She tells me they're a ""real win,""...cuz they allow for bust changes associated with weight gain or hormone shifts at certain times of the month(so a gal needn't buy all these extra sizes brassieres: Just an easy solution to a common problem for women. Great, and a reasonable price."
4.0,"I'm a size medium, but I wanted it to be loose, so I got a large. It was nice, as I expected. The cardigan was sort of thin, which I need for the summer, and the color was the same as the picture. What I didn't like was how short the sleeves were. It ended above my wrist. The length of the cardigan was also alright (ended at my butt), yet I wanted it to be a little lower."
4.0,"The material is great for dancing -- kind of athletic feeling, but also soft and good quality. I love the color and the fit at the bust. It shows some cleavage, but not so much where I have to worry about my bra showing while dancing. I'm 5'6, 130 pounds and I got a S. I definitely could've gotten an XS for a tighter waist look, but i'm happy with the fit. If I get the black one, I will try the XS though. My only complaint is that it's SUPER long. It goes a little past my knees. I wanted something longer, but not this long. I'm getting 4 inches taken off, so hopefully that will be a good length."
4.0,"Good quality product but very thin and light fabric.<br />I bought for my husband and he likes it.<br />True size,  It fits right so I think if you just order your regular size (small, medium, large, etc), it should fit fine.<br />It launder well, It had stood up to several washings already and it had not unraveled or faded or anything. Still looking great!"
4.0,Must be hand washed.
4.0,"I love this dress, and I have received so many complements while wearing it.  I'm a 14/16, and this dress fits perfectly.  It it quite stretchy and forgiving in all of the right places..  However, I am busty, and it does pull a little in the front. The buttons do not gape, so there is nothing to really worry about.  Yet, I wish the front was sewn as there is a side zip.<br /><br />All in all, it really is a lovely dress.  It hits below the knee, and the belt fits perfectly.  The fabric is heavy, typical of other dresses in this brand, and requires no slip.  I would purchase the dress again, and I would purchase from the seller - and have in the past.  Beautiful product."
4.0,My 6 year old loves these!
4.0,The ties and shoes were great items unfortunately the shoes were too narrow.
4.0,"I'm in my 50's and thought these would be cute. They are cute, and I can get them on with a lot of effort, and I don't have large ears at all--they are just very tiny, much tinier than I thought they would be. They are also shinier than expected.  They should really be aimed at teenagers, cause that's who they would fit nicely."
4.0,"I have short legs, so these fell right where my knee crease is, would love if they made a “petite” size, but they were comfortable, not always easy with my XL calves. Provided adequate support for my 7-hour flight."
4.0,Love it. I would love it more with a V neck. I'm having a seasmstress do that for me. But it's adorable. Nice fabric.
4.0,SIZE UP!! I got a medium like usual but the shirt was too small it's pretty tight around my chest area so I recommend size up! The skirt was ok? I didn't really like it. The accessories where to big on me and didn't fit but I might fix them! And the socks are quite long.
4.0,Elastic too tight. Otherwise keeps feet toasty warm and not too sweaty.
4.0,Great for young ladies but too small for me. Cute bag but gave it away.
4.0,"Exactly what I would have expected from two dollar tank tops. The hems are serge finished so not quite a &#34;raw&#34; edge but close. They are &#34;one size&#34; but they were also produced in China, so you need to adjust your expectations accordingly about what that means. I have pretty good luck with this stuff because I'm 5'2&#34; and petite with a small chest. These fit great on me and drape pretty well. They're a blend so they're really lightweight and the neckline is DEEP. I've only worn them around the house so far, but I think they'll be great for working out, as well (I don't mind people seeing my sports bra, ha ha)."
4.0,"Returned item as it was simply too small. Looks like a woman's bag. If it were a bit larger, for 15.4 inch MacBooks, then I would've kept it."
4.0,"Most definitely worth 5 bucks. Very cute. I got several compliments. It looks great and sophisticated against tans and browns. Great pop. Doesn't look too cheap. It's not the most comfortable necklace I've ever worn in my life,  the hinges are a little jabby/scratchy but nothing debilitating. It didn't hang as low as I thought based on the mannequin photo but lord knows how big that pictured mannequin is. But I'm also not a scrawny woman myself nor have a tiny little neck.  It barely touches the first sign of cleavage on me. I like it. I ordered it in black, too.<br /><br />They come from different places apparently,  one from America and one from Asia, even though they are from the 'same' seller. Thought that was noteworthy for anyone getting multiple colors thinking they'll get them at the same time or both in reasonable time. The turquoise arrived in about 5 days. Black says it's due January 20th (ordered like Dec 4th). Needless to say I'm happy with this based on what I paid. Nothing like cute jewelry to spice up plain but flattering tops that can take u from drab to stylish chic (that's my unconventional fashion preference, buy solid color plain flattering tops and then spend $50 on 15 to 20 different international costume jewelry pieces to put some flare on them and make it look like you know what you're doing and have a lot of combination ideas).... and at this price you'll never run out of cute necklaces to compliment plain stuff.<br /><br />12/22 The black and gold one I ordered that comes from a different place/country finally arrived. It's crinkled and I can't really get it to lay. Going to carefully attempt to hang it with tension or place something heavy on it (hopefully wont crank the beads, they're plastic). The color combination looks cheap together unfortunately. Not too cheap to wear if you don't work corporate of sorts but this color combo looks significantly less quality than the turquoise, like it actually looks like it's made out of plastic, which it is. But the other one looks fine."
4.0,"Great fit, great feel, stylish and lightweight.  A darker lens in this model and frame would be really nice."
4.0,comfy would buy again.
4.0,Gloves were my favorite<br />Still see glue on bunny ears
4.0,"I'm an adult female with I guess a smallish-head because I tried a couple adult sized versions and while they were comfortable, they didn't stay on very well, especially when talking, which I need to do for my job.  Those ones are fine for the store but I needed something that would stay tightly for conversations and I don't like the feel of the over the ear variety after long usage.  These are a little tight but that's perfect for staying on and being able to have a conversation.  They aren't as cool as I hoped but still breathable - I guess that's the trade off for ditching the over the ear kind.  Inexpensive so able to order several colors."
4.0,Had compliments already
4.0,Very pretty.  Have not used it yet.  Good price.
4.0,I got this for a gift. The owner has not mentioned any problems.
4.0,A bit smaller than expected but still fits
4.0,"I'm 6'2&#34; and usually wear a 42R (sometimes 42L). The X-tra large fit almost perfectly. The quality is good. The color was definitely Navy, not the lighter blue shown in the pictures."
4.0,Don't put in water because it will rust - but overall what I expected.
4.0,"This is what I was looking for, inexpensive and perfect for short trips."
4.0,"Soy talla media normalmente, pero en este modelo pienso que una talla pequeña sería la que me mejor me ajustaría.  Mi próxima compra será en talla pequeña."
4.0,It is a nice set
4.0,"My daughter likes them. The 2 sets that looks like drinks hang the wrong way, and the plastic bags with fish needed to be trimmed."
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because I love the skull charm  but when I  went to put the charm on the  black chord that came with the necklace  the clasp broke off and there is no way to fix it.
4.0,"Very nice, strong, and great quality. Although I had to reorder 24mm watch pins. From Amazon of corse. All is well my watch has been repaired😀"
4.0,Debes comprarla más grande que lo usual.<br />En esta compra tuve que devolverla para una talla más grande. Además y muy lamentable este artículo vino ufano y evidencias de fuerte sudor en área de las axilas. Gracias
4.0,These fit good and are holding together well.
4.0,"These socks are a little larger on me than others I got in the same size, which makes them provide a little less compression. Other than that they are perfectly fine. Since they're a little larger they're a little easier to get on and off, and they still provide a reasonable amount of compression. The quality seems good and they look just like the pictures. No worries about how they'll hold up over time with repeated washing, any more than any other compression socks."
4.0,Good true to size shirts.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:7287a35cd1c8793c93f49a3f3034aecc]] I love the colors. The only thing I don’t like is there’s a gap where my Fitbit meets the band which cases the band to snap off with little to no pressure put on the band. That the only reason I’m not giving this item 5 ⭐️
4.0,"I’m 5’5”, 185lbs. Ordered a 14-16. The top fits great but the shorts show half my rear end. I will be wearing my longer swim shorts with this one for sure."
4.0,These socks are great for not binding on your calves especially if your legs tend to swell over the day.  They fit very low on the calf and even though they are 70% cotton they feel much more like polyester than cotton (tend to be a little warmer than I like.)  Overall seem to be a good quality sock for dress shoes for work.
4.0,"The bag is lovely! the only thing I noticed was that the dye (or color) is lighter in places. It wasn't as obvious in the on-line photos but it looks almost like it's sun-faded, like it was left in a window.<br /><br />It is a rather tight fit. I can get my HP Pavilion 15.6&#34; laptop in it and maybe a few thin folders or spiral notebooks. I cannot fit my textbooks into the bag. There are two slim outside pockets to use but once the inside is full, there is not a lot of room in the outside pockets. I was able to fit the power cord, my small mouse, and the mouse pad (yes, I still use one)."
4.0,nice for kids
4.0,"I was skeptical at first. But it has proven to be reliable and comfortable. I use it at a hospital environment, does not interfere in my surgical cap or mask."
4.0,Tight in the shoulders but cute dress
4.0,Much better quality than I expected. The soles do come out but they can slip right back in. They're definitely worth the price!!
4.0,"These run large so I cant say how they work as a sports bra, but for every day wear they are comfortable."
4.0,Love the comfortable feel of this Shirt.<br />Also the fit is accurate.<br />the Collar is a bit different than I'm used to but it doesn't bother me.<br />A great every day Shirt
4.0,A little snug but overall ok. I wish it had an extra half inch of velcro...
4.0,used as  a gift.
4.0,Love the pattern and quality of maven thread but they are definitely thick. Ideal for winter but maybe not for working out.
4.0,Very cute and washes well. But it is very snug.
4.0,"The fit was great-- I'd say true to size. The only downside was how see through the fabric is, but it's white, everything white it basically see through. Paired with a slip, everything was just fine.<br />I wore it to a white party on a cruise and got so many compliments. I'd wear and buy again."
4.0,Very cute and thick but it is a little large. On the upside... I can put all of my hair in it without it feeling too tight. Considering my hair goes to the bottom of my back... The hat fits a little large without my hair in it.
4.0,"A narrow wrap bracelet. It's thinner than it appears in the pictures, has different stud patterns on each half, and unlike the current product name, doesn't actually have any spikes.<br /><br />It works as an unusual bracelet / wristband, but doesn't lay flat (since it has to cross over itself to be snapped shut). I also found it worked as a slender gender-neutral choker, which I wore as part of a rockstar costume-- as long as your neck isn't too thick (it was borderline tight on me, I wear a 16&#34; dress-shirt collar).<br /><br />I also tried the &#34;punk rock wide&#34; bracelet which is currently part of the same Amazon listing as the wrap bracelet (mentioning it here, since I can't review 2 items from this listing separately). It works fairly well also, though seems a little too shiny for the its punk design, and I found it unsnapped if the bracelet edge caught on something. The &#34;wide&#34; version is less interesting than the &#34;wrap&#34; version.<br /><br />That versatility and solid construction make this bracelet Recommended."
4.0,The pants fit perfectly but the top is a tad tight in the sleeves. The top fits everywhere else and its bot bad for the price.
4.0,I have these as a Christmas gift and she absolutely 💛 them !!!
4.0,"I’m Hocus Pocus obsessed and bought this shirt to add to the Halloween season. It was very affordable and the fabric is rather soft…not scratchy, which is great. I do think the sizing runs a bit small."
4.0,Fits a tad bit small  but not bad.  I love the shirt design
4.0,"These were for my niece and she liked them.  She may be too old at 13 though for these, but I still love them."
4.0,I do a lot of high intensity workout and I this is the first bra I haven't had to wear another bra with it. The only thing that I don't like is the zipper does show a little bit.
4.0,"Love these socks.  Wish they went one size larger.  Perfect for the winter cold, when worn under another pair of socks."
4.0,The pants were GREAT! Just too big.  I returned with no problem and reordered a smaller size!
4.0,The colors on these come exactly as pictured. They are very beautiful unique pieces. I love that I can mix and match these as well so you get lots of possibilities. Great quality as well.
4.0,"Not as big as I thought, but good quality."
4.0,Cute shirt. Love the print! However it is made with cheap material and i sized up to a medium but it’s too big. However it still works.
4.0,The skirt was beautiful!
4.0,"Overall, its a cute shirt. Would like the ""off-the-shoulder "" pert to actually stay ""off-the-shoulder """
4.0,"Love this shirt! It fits perfect and vozy with a tank underneath. But if you have pets, it will collect every damn price of hair. However, worth it."
4.0,"I purchased this for my sister for Christmas and she really liked it. She is really into succulents and was planning on taking a trip so I got these for her to put on her hat, jacket, or bag. Although I do not know if she has used them for anything as of yet, when I was checking them out before gifting them they looked to be really well made; the chain that the water droplet and others hang from seem quite strong and well attached. Although they seem pretty small, they are fun and have really cute designs."
4.0,"The ring is very pretty. As another reviewer noted, the ring runs a bit small. Also, my ring is missing a stone, but it still looks okay. Disappointing, but still pretty."
4.0,Love this dress for work. Fit was perfect
4.0,"The Pabin slim, leather, front pocket wallet is great if your looking for a slim design,leather, long bill inside pocket, and RFID protection.  The inside of the wallet has 4 slots, 2 on each side, to put license, card, or your favorite picture.  The RFID lining protects from RFID scanners and is nice to have in case someone tries to electronically pickpocket you. The dollar bill slot is convenient because it lets you put the bills in at full length, no more folding them.  The only thing I don't like is when opening the bill slot it is ridged, making it hard to open wide to fit a lot of bills or find something that had fallen inside.  I wish it was soft and flexable.  The outside of the wallet is nice, soft and attractive to the eye.  It also has a slot where your can put your license or card, i liked that.  The whole wallet is covered with genuine cowhide leather, so it looks more expensive.  The wallet had a very small odor when I first got it but went away quickly.  The price was well worth it and Im happy with the way it has held up so far. When putting wallet in my front pocket, its small enough that I can still put my keys or whatever else in it.  I recommend this product.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!"
4.0,"They are a little short than some, have to watch going over my hair a little, but then I can lean over to do something and they don’t swing into anything. Seems they will last awhile and I like the variety. I just have readers and bought enough to place a pair in every room because, invariably, they all gravitated to the same room. Not all women’s clothing has pockets. Now it is easier to keep up with a pair."
4.0,"Nice product, am satisfied."
4.0,i love this necklace. the only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because i would have like the chain to be a bit longer. i plan on getting a longer chain however the moon does not slide on the chain so i need to figure out how i will make it work with the longer one.
4.0,I love the dress!!!! Could use a little more room in the hip area.
4.0,"I bought this product because it looked amazing. After trying it on, I was disappointed that it was too small. This swim suit seems to be best fitted to a person with a shorter torso. I am 5' 7'' and I think this would best work for someone who is maybe 3 inches shorter. The dark area around the breast was too far down my chest.<br />If this weren't the case, I would definitely love this swim suit."
4.0,"Beautiful glasses, however they are too tight and rub behind my ears."
4.0,I’m 5’5” 110lbs 34dd and ordered the S. It fits looser than I expected but it’s cute for the price and I’m pleased still after washing it twice.
4.0,"This is a beautiful stone BUT I bought it to go with an emerald-cut ring.  I was disappointed to discover That, although the shape is right, it's not emerald cut.  It's more like a checkerboard cut.  Maybe the &#34;emerald shape&#34; should have clued me in but the picture looks like an emerald cut."
4.0,"Great purse for travel!  I have traveled with this purse to a number of different countries, and always felt the items in the purse are safe.  There are a number of different zippered compartments, that hold quite a bit more than I expected.  I can easily fit my kindle, a large sunglasses case, 20oz coffee tumbler, wallet, phone and keys, and still have room let over.  My camera (Sony alpha) does fit, but makes the purse bulge when zipped shut.  Only the main compartment has a zipper that locks.  I have not checked the RFID blocking on this, as I use a wallet that is also RFID blocking.  There is also an RFID wristlet that comes with this.  It is nice to take when you are going out and don't want the full purse!  The pattern is nice as well.  Would recommend this purse!"
4.0,"Seems like a quality built belt, only tine will tell. I gave the product four stars due to the fact the belt is only a month old. I will update the review after I have used it for a few months."
4.0,"Works great but I had to make sure I can put things in the slots through the side, the front is too small. I still really like it for organizing my workout area. It fit nicely behind the door too."
4.0,Thin but comfy. Would buy again.
4.0,"These are my husband's go-to masks. He likes the fit and feel. Only thing to make them better would be a metal band at the nose.  But other than that, they are great! Good value."
4.0,"comfortable, highly recommended"
4.0,I haven't worn it yet but I do like it a lot. I appreciated the free gift also
4.0,"Cute, but not as wide as the photo makes it seem to be. Do love it though as long as I wear it with another band for width."
4.0,Honestly I did return it BUT it’s only because I didn’t know it’d look odd on me. I’m tall and my legs aren’t huge. So yeah. But the quality of materials are great and if buy another product from this company.
4.0,Nice shirt but some of the graphics are peeling slightly on the edges.
4.0,Favorite new toy
4.0,"I absolutely love Mordenmiss and have already bought 6 or 7 dresses from them that all fit just great. But this one was probably not my favorite. I ordered a large like always, but this one was pretty tight in the chest and i'm a 36C. The fabric was a little thicker and coarser than i expected which made the wrinkles very hard to get out of even after hanging it for a few weeks. All Mordenmiss dresses are this big bag style that I love, but this one especially felt like an excessive amount of fabric caused from the gathering at the waste seam and the thick fabric. It says cotton/linen which it very well may be, but it feels like all cotton. Much like a cotton kitchen towel or little less than a fabric place mat kind of thickness. I like the other mordenmiss dresses more for sure, but I like this dress just fine. I didn't return it."
4.0,Every thing sonic is expensive not sure why these are 25 bucks but my kid loved em and they have held up well but nothing special but it’s sonic<br /><br />Supply and demand I guess
4.0,"Where to start? The instructions that come in the box kinda suck, and over two thirds of it get thrown away because of being in foreign languages, if they put only the language for the area it's sold to I'm sure they'd save several trees. Also, they're not very informative, you have to look in the app for most things or Casio's website for better instructions.<br /><br />It has great looks, but one of the biggest problems I have is the letters are TINY and the so-called ""superilluminator"" doesn't help see them, I have to use my phone light to see them.<br /><br />The light isn't as bright as I was expecting it to be, and one of my pet peeves is that you can only set it to 1.5 or 3 seconds, I want it to stay on as long as the button is pressed. but not an option.<br /><br />I wish the buttons stuck out a little further so as to be easier to press, I have nerve damage in my fingers and can't feel as well as I should be able to so I have to press really hard to get the buttons to cooperate.<br /><br />I also wish the band was a little longer. As a bigger guy, I'm on the second to last hole in the band<br /><br />Will edit if anything changes or I remember something else<br /><br />Edit: The hourly chime and alarm are so quiet I've only heard either 2-3 times, and do NOT try to rely on this as a wakeup alarm"
4.0,"Nice, but I returned. I was looking for another type of design"
4.0,paint job was a little eh. But they do the job for a cosplay
4.0,Im currently a size 16-18 or 2x and I ordered an xxlarge. Im 5’ 1” no alterations needed. Dress fit perfectly. My original dress had a small defect so I returned it and ordered the dress again. The second dress I noticed the lines didn’t really match up but no big deal especially for the price.
4.0,Very pretty but a little too long.
4.0,"I love the bralette! The lace is good quality and not itchy, and it’s easy to nurse wearing the bra. My only concern is it runs small compared to the KB French terry bras. I can’t wear this all day as the fit under the bust gets uncomfortable. Size up if possible. I’m an XL so I’m in the largest size."
4.0,"Note - I received this item free of charge for review purposes.<br /><br />A review on a watch is a kind of tricky thing, simply because so much of the watch design is stylistic, and therefore subjective.  For instance, I like large faces with a substantial build and a kind of chunky look to them.  However, others may hate that kind of look, preferring the sleek and svelte.  So it's in that spirit that I write this review...some of my criticisms may revolve around style and not so much substance.<br /><br />Now then, before I go further there is something that really needs to be clearly mentioned, since I think BUREI is a little coy about it.  This watch is made in China.  There is a slogan with the included materials that says &#34;Swiss watches since 1983.&#34;  Well, they are &#34;Swiss&#34; in the sense that the designers and engineers are trained by Swiss craftsmen, but these aren't Swiss watches.  This one in particular has a Japanese quartz movement but the watch itself is made/assembled in China.  That said, I don't think this detracts from the quality of the watch (heck, my iPhone is made in China....), but I do think the buyer should be fully aware of what this watch is.<br /><br />Now then, on the merits this watch is really well built.  It has some heft to it, which has connotations of quality, and the chrome is a nice contrast to the black dial and band.  It does have a rather busy face, with several dials.  And it's at this point that I arrive at my first criticism...the second hand is NOT the longish one that you see in the picture and think &#34;hey, that's the second hand!&#34;  No, the second hand is actually the small dial just below the center of the face.  This caused me no end of confusion at first (&#34;why is it keeping good time but the second hand isn't moving...?&#34;), but after some fiddling it dawned on me.  Also, it's not like the included manual was much help...it read like a generic manual covering a number of different models.  Anyway, you're still wondering what that other hand actually is.  Well, the watch has a timer, activated by the top button, and THAT is what that &#34;second&#34; hand is measuring.  It's a little (OK, a lot) offputting.<br /><br />Another thing that bears mentioning...this is not a sweep action - the second hand, timer hand, etc all tick along with graduated movements.<br /><br />Last major nit - I'm an average sized guy.  I mean, I'm certainly not gargantuan or anything.  And while I really like the band on this watch, it's really very much on the small side.  I get to the second hole on the strap and that's about it...any further gets really uncomfortable.<br /><br />BUT, and that's in caps because it's important...I do like the watch.  It's funky.  It's interesting.  It's eye catching.  The second hand, timer hand, etc, all align properly with the tickmarks on the outer edge of the dial...and a nice touch, they align uniformly AROUND the dial.  This is a little detail that many el cheapo watchmakers miss, so that BUREI pays attention to it speaks well about their quality control.  As for operation, the watch is silent...no tick tick tick.<br /><br />It is marked Water Resistant 30m on the back, but in practical terms that basically means you're good against incidental splashes or accidental exposure to the rain.  This won't handle submersion, or at least I wouldn't care to risk it.<br /><br />So overall, I think this is a good watch.  Presentation is certainly professional, with the watch nestled on a leatherette pillow in a large box (I'll attach a photo).  It's assertive enough on the wrist to command attention, but not so assertive that it demands that attention.  I'm still a little nonplussed about the big second hand not really being a second hand, but I'm inclined to call that a stylistic nit and nothing more.  It's a good watch that is made well.  I like it."
4.0,"I was happy to finally find a 6L compress stuff sack to fit my relatively low volume 35 degree bag, since most companies start at 10 or 11 liters, which is way too large for my light weight bag.<br /><br />The XS I ordered was very slow to arrive, as I knew it would be when ordering.  I like that one of the compression straps is releasable.  I was worried 4 compression straps might be inadequate, but they seem to work fine.  It’s very light weight at 1.5 - 1.6 ounces.<br /><br />It’s not water proof, it’s a compression sack, not a dry bag.  One shouldn’t fault a compression stuff sack for not being a dry bag IMO.<br /><br />My one complaint is the dimensions are off.  The XS is advertised at 6 x 14 and 6L uncompressed.  The one I received was about 5.5 X 12, the same as another reviewer noted.  I can barely stuff my bag into a couple different brand 5L stuff sacks I own, so I figured this sack advertised at 6 would be perfect, but I find it just as tight to get my bag in, so I suspect, the actual uncompressed volume is more like 5L, though I have no way to measure this accurately.<br /><br />I think this is a great little, light, hard to find stuff sack, but I give it a 3 star rating because the incorrect dimensions can cause one to order a size that does not fit as it should and that can be a big problem."
4.0,This is very cute and  different! It is so hard to find cute clothes for boys.  It is made very small though.
4.0,Very good product.  Very comfortable and effective in muffling loud sounds while still able to hear voices.
4.0,It's true they are heavy cotton gloves and the sewing really need improving but overall they are acceptable
4.0,The medium fits me and I usually wear a small. The XL does not fit my mom even though she usually wears a large.
4.0,"Cute top. However the edges sag forward exposing my bra (and if I’m not wearing one, my whole breast). Other than that, it’s cute. Just need to be careful wearing"
4.0,Was excited to find this shirt! Shirt quality is thin. Order a large looks like a medium. But besides that it’s a good shirt.
4.0,Very cute dress.  I am typically a medium but had to size up
4.0,Really soft. Great leggings. Not see through
4.0,The lace on the collar is too large.  But overall the item is excellent.
4.0,It was a nice shirt just fit a little too small for me.
4.0,Looks just like the picture. The strap itself is very durable. But the hook broke within a week because it was just a little too long for me.
4.0,This thing is soo cute and in theory very helpful! I wish I could give it 5 stars but there are a couple reasons I can't.<br />First I'll say the product itself is adorable and really does help block out the sun. But if you are extremely sensitive to the sun like me then check out the photo - sun actually comes right through between the visor band and shield which can be debilitating if you have photobia.<br />The band.... It's pretty nice but very squeezy. If you have sensory processing disorder then consider that it does not wrap around the back of the head but uses pressure on either side to keep it in place.<br />The band IS highly flexible if you want to adjust it but for me if I adjust it enough to relieve the pressure then it no longer stays on. :(<br />If the band were a wrap around velcro one then I'd give it 5 stars and just add something to the brim to block out that gap where the sun comes in.
4.0,"Cheap fabric, but easy to put on / take off, looks reasonable at a distance, well sown, comfortable.  I use it to swim laps, and it is excellent.  Don't buy for a fancy vacation."
4.0,For starters I weigh 260lbs (5’10) and wear a women’s size 16 in jeans and xl in shirts. I was worried about this dress not fitting but it was exactly what I wanted and I went for it. Firstly the arms are SMALL way too small for me as an XL. I wear a 38D and the chest was tight but not terrible. The skirt was perfect. The length was good too. I could probably wear it without but I was planning on wearing leggings any way so I wasn’t worried about it being too short. I sew for a hobby so I think I’ll turn it into a tank top dress and wear a sweater with it. The quality is actually pretty nice for $16 very thick. It’s really comfortable in the places it’s not squeezing me.
4.0,Nice shirt but it runs very small.  I have to return it.
4.0,"Cute, but too big for a child"
4.0,Love it!!! Got tons of compliments when I first wore it. Fits great!
4.0,Product as stated. Overall satisfied.
4.0,It’s ideal length. I’m 5’3” and it reaches my ankles. It’s roomy enough at the bottom that it’s easy to sit and walk. It’s stretchy material so that added to the comfort. Overall I liked it and ordered another one in a different color. I’m 5 months pregnant so comfort was my only criteria!
4.0,very good for kids but the patriotic one has 4 July written on it so IT IS NOT PICTURED AS SHOWN other than that would have been 5 stars
4.0,Beautiful headband the lace is a little more yellow than the photo shows but it's still very beautiful and ive gotten many comments on it
4.0,"I really like these glasses.  The only issue I had, and it's because I have a relatively small face, was that the side handles bow outward a little too much.  I had my optician adjust them and they're better, but I wish the side handles were straighter.  Then they would have fit a little better.  The red color is very nice -- sort of a cranberry red rather than a bright red."
4.0,small in the arms for that size
4.0,Lovely. The only thing to make it better would be if it were adjustable.
4.0,"It stopped the pain in my shoulder. It also tarnish and leaves a green residue on my skin, which comes off with soap and water."
4.0,Ok skirt..
4.0,"got this for my wife to try on for size. she normally wears an L and this fitted her just fine. i got the mocha hem vest as it was described; with the product photo being close to beige. i preferred the lighter or beige color so ordered it.  it did turn out to be more of beige in color. she liked it.<br />she tried it on with her jeans, high heels and sleeveless blouse (similar to the product photo model) and she looks  even better - the wife read this😇👏🤪.<br />the material is soft and very light. perfect for transitioning seasons from summer to fall. loving the look and recommend it."
4.0,It's Really pretty just like in the picture I just thought it was going to be a little longer ... But other than that super nice!
4.0,"Nice quality, especially for the cost. Great summer weight but with a full liner so not too sheer. I ordered Large Red and will exchange for Medium as it is a little big (wide and long). I am 5'4&#34;, 160lbs, 38&#34; bust. If Medium fits I would definitely consider ordering another color also."
4.0,"granddaughter will love this necklace. Small, but not so small that it cannot be admired. The Italian snake chain is very, very nice.  Sturdy without being bulky.<br />The price was really great."
4.0,I really like the coat. I am one who is often cold and I have already put the coat to a test. We were outside for an extended period with temps in 30's and I felt warm. The only downfall was the size of the coat<br /> I read some where the sizes run small and based on that I ordered a size larger and it is a little too big. I would say the sizes are true and you should order your normal size.
4.0,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  It was exactly what i hoped it would be and my hubby really likes it!
4.0,Only reason why I knocked off a star is because they fall out super easily. I had to find backings to another pair of earrings I have that fit to use with these.
4.0,The pendant is way brighter and shinier than the picture given I thought it would be a bit darker. The chain it came on was broken but I fixed it.
4.0,Very happy with fit
4.0,"Worked like a charm to ensure our bags stayed closed, and made it easy to spot them on the conveyor belt. I had one of my bags pop open one time - not pretty. Straps plenty long for even our largest clamshell hardside bag, on the long axis."
4.0,They run a bit small! Besides that they are great
4.0,"I like this dress but there are a few issues. The white flowers at the top don't lay flat against my boobs like on the model. It keeps puckering outward, maybe because I ordered a L instead of a M. It's hard to explain. Also, it's not really slim at the bottom. I thought it would be because of the split in the back. So it's basically like bodycon at the top & a little loose at the bottom. I ordered the black & white dress in L. I'm 5'6&#34; 140lbs & wear a 34D."
4.0,Love these after my first wear! Definitely will order more... but shipping took awhile for some reason
4.0,It’s a very nice watch but too heavy and bulky for my likings.
4.0,"I actually would keep this dress had it not been for the weird sleeve length and super plunging neckline. Sleeves just fit me weird. It was neither 3/4 or wrist length. Neckline plunging and I'd have to wear with a cami (sports bra shown) or pin it or sew it. Otherwise, this dress fit great, length, waist, shoulders, all fit great. It's not sheer but maybe a bit sheer in direct sunlight. The material smoothes out wrinkles when stretched . I'm 5'3"" 115 lbs and wear a 34C for reference."
4.0,"Decent basic skirt for the money. Not the highest quality, but it's not terrible either. The fabric is thick enough that a slip isn't necessary."
4.0,"Well made belt and fully adjustable, but it does have its drawbacks.  The only one worth mentioning is it can be a little slow in getting it off, as in the case where you really have to drop the pants fast aka having the runs.  The Velcro section makes it difficult to secure and route under the last belt hoop due to its length so I just wrap the the top of the belt over the last hoop and secure it that way."
4.0,Bonitos valen la pena
4.0,"The sandal is attractive, supports the foot and is extremely comfortable!  I bought this on my doctor’s recommendation."
4.0,"We have an older one that has made several international trips, and we decided to stick with a product that has served as well.  I'd recommend this over other brands and other products.  The price we paid ($169) was also reasonable."
4.0,"Very large, bigger than I expected. Quality seems ok."
4.0,It's a little smaller than I would like but the same quality as the previous one that I purchased from the Jersey shore.
4.0,"Very lightweight sweatshirt. It's by no means a heavyweight collegiate type, but it's nice all the same. Not sure why it's advertised as men's - it's just a sweatshirt. Maybe because it's a boxier fit and the sleeves are looser. I still plan to wear it all the same in the fall with a comfortable pair of faded jeans. I'm happy with it."
4.0,"I like this wallet because it is stylish and well made, and I like the built-in security. The only drawback is that it is too small.  There is not enough room for me to keep my debit receipts until I balance my bank statement, and the zippered coin slot compartment is too small.  I have a hard time getting coins out.  Over all, it is a nice wallet for the price.  The good features outweigh the small size."
4.0,"Excellent quality. The frame is beautiful, sturdy, and well designed. My nose is not very tall, and these types of large sunglasses usually sit on my cheeks. This pair, however, fits my face well, giving me good coverage and protection without touching my cheeks and messing up my makeup. The hinges are also fairly tight, keeping it from falling off my face like my other pair did. I also love that it's scratch resistant.<br /><br />I have the &#34;coffee&#34; pair, which is almost black on the outside, taupe on the inside, and if you look from the top, you will notice the middle is actually clear. It's classy. The sunglasses also come with a black protective nylon bag which is stiff, making it easier to insert the sunglasses.<br /><br />On the down side, I must say that I do feel that they look humongous and not a current style I see around anymore. And also when I look at the glare of cars in traffic, the glares appear to be pink or green. When I remove the glasses, I don't see that. It's kind of odd. So while it's good quality and helpful for the beach, I dont use it for every day because I don't like the look and style."
4.0,"Since the reviews already warned about it being cut small I won't ding it but one star on that.  Other than that, looked sexy on my woman for opening night of Suicide Squad!"
4.0,Don't know how men could wear these unless they are super skinny. Kinda tight even on me but do go up to the elbows and I have very long arms
4.0,"I mean for the price..its a great bargain. Size reference Medium-5'3_36/30/41.  Super soft, stretchy, vibrant colors. For a quick easy dress for summer/vacation...its a good buy. Quality is decent, delicate wash and dry. You can fold the rushing in the middle to play with the length."
4.0,I love it besides it easily tears. Which is disappointing.  I have room in top but . I spotted a tiny hole on stomach area.  Second time wearing it. Thank god I have 2 more. But I love the fit so comfortable but needs stronger material for actual work out.
4.0,"This is a stunning skirt - quite a statement piece.  I wore this as hostess dress at an Alice in Wonderland themed party.  It was perfect for the Queen of Hearts. The skirt is well made with a heavy, but smooth (not shiny) poly.  The colors are just as vibrant as in the picture and it even has pockets! This is not a dress as described...It is a skirt and a blouse. The blouse is a throw away piece.  Literally, I threw it away.  The blouse fabric is very thin and cheap feeling, and extremely tight even though I followed the measurements when ordering.  I took one star off because of the blouse.  The skirt on its own deserve 5 stars."
4.0,"The boot hits just under my knee cap, as opposed to actually being fully over the knee.  The material does look realistic enough like slightly distressed brown leather.  My calf measures 15.5 inches and the boot fits fine over jeans. The back top of the boot is somewhat awkward feeling when it hits the back of my knee.  I measure 8 C or D and the size 8 fits fine."
4.0,"I’m very picky about purses and this one is pretty awesome. My only complaint is there are no pockets on the inside. The outside is lined with pockets. I just wish that little zipper one (where you hide tiny things like tampons and chapstick) was there. Great quality. The strap is super cute. Comes with a black one, too. I’ve gotten many compliments. It’s the perfect size for me."
4.0,"Really great shorts except the legs and seat are too tight. This combined with the relatively thick fabric and longer leg length impedes airflow too much. The fabric does breath well but not well enough to make up for the lack of air flow in the Florida climate. Also the tightness limits the cargo pocket usability. Made in Vietnam apparently for typical Vietnamese body dimensions.They may work better for you if you don't have well muscled legs, yeah I'm talkin' to you Slim. Thinking about chopping of an inch from the hem to improve air flow, that's about all there is between the cargo pocket bottom and the hemline. Also thinking about establishing my fashion empire by bringing back the loincloth as tropical sports wear, updated of course with stretch fabric and cargo pockets. Plus ca change..."
4.0,"Not enough room in the seat, but other than said he said it works."
4.0,"These are pretty decent cases. Better than just letting your glasses lie around, but very thin. Glad I bought the multi-pack, as I can keep a couple in each car."
4.0,Son loves the design and the wristband is durable but the clip itself could be a little more durable.
4.0,"This fit actually a little big when I got it..but shrank a good bit in the dryer. Now it fits a tiny bit small. I like the material and the fit. It's flattering and comfortable. I own a couple of these and will probably get more in the future. I've had a lot of cardigans, most lose their shape throughout the day and this one is no different but it doesn't make in uncomfortable or unwearable.  I took off one star for how much it shrank in the dryer. Hang these to dry, don't make my mistake."
4.0,"Runs on the bigger/ longer size. Perfect for my daughter bc she is tall. Otherwise, size down."
4.0,"Bought it for a friend, she loves it. My friend has small wrists so it fits kinda loose (to my taste). It would fit a &#34;regular&#34; wrist perfectly."
4.0,It's beautifully dainty as I was expecting but not as shiny as I wanted it to be.
4.0,So cute!! Not a tight waist band which is perfect for me.
4.0,Received in timely manner. Looked gorgeous when I opened it but was disappointed that one jewel had already fallen out. Really hoping that more don't fall out!!
4.0,Bien por el precio.
4.0,Super tiny and perfect. I'll be ordering more🤘
4.0,"I realize there are a lot of mixed reviews for these &#34;night driving&#34; glasses. And I totally understand what everyone is saying. The reason I chose to try them is because I really struggle with driving at night (especially if it's raining). Here's as detailed as I can get as to why they work for ME: without them- when cars are coming at me, the &#34;white&#34; lights almost blind me; I have to avert my eyes over to the right-hand side of the road & focus on the white line (if there is one) in order to stay in my lane. With the glasses- it takes away the &#34;blinding&#34; effect. The headlights are still bright but the yellow of the glasses makes it so that I don't have to avert my eyes at all; they &#34;soften&#34; the glare. Having said all that, the downside (for me) is that they sort of distort the other things- business you pass, trees, etc. They just take a little getting use to. They work for me and the price was worth taking the chance."
4.0,"I am 6&#34; 190. I have long torso and athletic build. I wish there was padding in the bra. The cups a large c-d cups. Lol, the roughing helps. I do like the fit. It's hugs your curves and compliments them. The length is a bit short. But I am an Amazon woman, most of you it should fit well... I am going to keep it because its super cute."
4.0,I absolutely love it. I felt I had to take off one star for the price. It's quite expensive.
4.0,good set of cufflinks
4.0,Even though it said one size fits all it was specifically an extra large upon arrival
4.0,The only place where there is a little irritation is in the inseam with the zipper. I have to have a light full sock or tights on to be comfortable having them on all day. Otherwise I love these shoes!
4.0,Casual and comfortable! Wrinkles easily but otherwise a really great jumpsuit
4.0,It was super cute wore it for otakon and everything fit nicely. The only issue was the bow came a little torn off so I tried to fix that but even then still got a ton of compliments! Its a little short on tall ppl heads up<br /><br />I'm size 4 in clothes and 5'9 135 lbs
4.0,"This was sent to me to test and review. I think the jacket gets pretty high marks across the board with the exception of a few points. It is comfortable and fits well. It has a detachable hood which is a nice feature as well as a neck guard that can be secured in place with Velcro or left open. I like the number of pockets that zip both on the outside and inside of the jacket. It heats up pretty quickly, and I found at full charge, on high heat, it will heat for up to 3 hours. The 3 adjustable heat settings are a nice feature. The battery does take pretty long to charge fully. I will be doing a full video review soon on my You Tube channel - AZ Overland"
4.0,It's a sexy swim suit but if you have curves you can forget about ordering your normal size. my breast are small (34B) but I have a small waist with a big ass so I ordered a medium just to make sure my titties wouldn't look saggy in something too big. The top fit perfectly but the bottoms were waaaay too small. I literally just ordered a larger size right now (LARGE) so I could have a medium top with a large bottom. OVERALL it looks exactly like the photo and worth the price. I liked it just need a larger size for all this booty lol
4.0,Nice stones r beautiful
4.0,Light weight and nice clarity
4.0,"nice summer dress, a little thin in the fabric will need to wear something underneath to not see bra"
4.0,"Both this and the Disguise brand Jolly Holiday dress have some notable pros and cons.  I think in the end I'm going to try some DIY to mix and match.<br /><br />For this brand:<br /><br />PROS:<br />- MUCH better made than the Disguise brand overall!  More carefully sewed and better quality fabric.<br />- I love that this one has a separate red corset/waistband, unlike the other brand. It makes such a difference in how flattering it is.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I think the hat looks silly -- the fake leaves are so cheap looking, the crown is too small, and the brim is too narrow.  The Disguise hat is better, and I will probably use that.<br />- There's not enough fabric in the underarm.  I won't be able to hold my arm up even as far as shoulder height without danger of ripping or shifting the whole costume up.<br />- The cap sleeves are out of place, just hanging out there. I think I might try to cut them off.<br />- Mine came with matching zip-up shoe covers, which is thoughtful, but they're way too huge for me to be able to use them.<br />- The ruffle and sleeve/dress appliques are not well tacked down, so they kind of flutter all over the place.  I'm going to have to hit them with some fabric glue.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad to have these options of pre-made dresses rather than spending $500+ on a custom dress.  But I think in the end it's going to take buying and messing with both versions to create a result I'm happy with."
4.0,"Very pretty. Fits well on middle ear cartalidge but hurts to get on, since not adjustable. Will return if doesn’t stop hurting to get on."
4.0,"For the money, it's actually pretty well made and the material seems like good quality. My only complaint is the size. I really thought it would larger, but that's really my fault I guess, for not really the dimensions closely enough. Too small for me."
4.0,"Nice looking bag, and the quality seems high... Only downside is that you have to slide stuff in from the side (it doesn't open up across the front) so that makes it a bit fiddley to keep clothes straight when putting them in...  Has lots of pockets to keep things separate, and the straps are nice (tho the clips on the shoulder strap are a bit cheap looking and I'm not sure if they will last with heavy use, but so far so good..."
4.0,Well made and very nice.. Have 4 stars because it was MUCH bigger than the pic made it out to be.. But still very nice bag. It could fit a whole laptop computer in it and you wouldn't even know.
4.0,Good and comfortable.
4.0,Very nice just a little to big I should have got a M.
4.0,"A few reviews said it was oversized but actually it's very true to size. If you have broad shoulders or a large chest order a size up. The model in the photo must be wearing at least 2 sizes up..lol!<br />Overall it is a beautiful blouse, I ordered a second in another color."
4.0,No &#34;give&#34; in the material but fit as expected. Lightweight but not sheer.
4.0,It is was it is and what is was supposed to be. Good price and actually received it. Yeah! Yeah!
4.0,great quality and fit. my calves are not huge but pretty big so after a few uses these will fit perfect. the compression is just right. they feel like a hug lol.
4.0,"The manufacturer did not state up-front, that they had to be washed in cold water and line dried. If they did, it was not very obvious. Who line dries anymore? It's a hassle because the rest of my clothes go from the washer to the dryer. Now I have to line dry underwear.  I won't be repurchasing these for that reason.<br />Update 7/18/19: I just put on a pair of the underwear after they were washed and line dried per manufacturers instructions. They have shrunk, and now the waist rolls and the legs ride up. I usually were a large and purchased an XL in case they shrank. They are now just a little bigger than medium. I am very disappointed."
4.0,We got these for a men’s retreat the guys really like them they’re mature enough for men the chain could be a little longer because the men have larger next but all in all turned out to be a really nice gift for the price.
4.0,"Very well made, very simple and elegant.."
4.0,Pleased.  This product is as advertised.  Not sure why it took me so long to buy something like this for my watches.  It is so nice to have all my automatic wind watches ready to wear every morning.
4.0,Super cute but too long. I'm 5'7 and the dress hit the floor. Unless I wore high heels (which I don't) this wasn't gonna work for me. I had to return.
4.0,"Cute but you have to work to keep it in place crawling up the ear.  It they do drop down, it's no big deal since they still look good.  The company has contacted me to try to make me happy and I appreciate that - even offering a full refund.  I will keep them though as I do like them."
4.0,"When I purshased this corset I got it in a size medium,but when I tried it on it was a lil too small I had to expand the back a lot in order to close the front. First day of wearing the corset it was painful & I do get cuts on my hips but it might be from it being a lil smaller. I do recommend going a size bigger & the quality of it is great ."
4.0,The shirt looks nice and has held up to multiple washes. But they definitely run small. My daughter usually wears a M and I got her an XL and it fits like her M shirts do.
4.0,"A little small to carry gear and cold weather survival stuff so the heavy stuff goes on the sled, which makes my back happy!  Well made so far, and almost seems water proof (material), good pack and good price, I would get another one.  I have the same pack in the other winter camo pattern which is better (pine tree camo) with more white camo.  Same packs, just different white camo patterns."
4.0,"Nice, soft and warm beanie and infinity scarf set. The burgundy color is more purple in person, which I was a little dissapointed because I really liked the more red/maroon color it showed in the picture.  But it is a nice set and serves it's purpose well."
4.0,These look great and seem durable enough.  But they are a bit thin and only meant for costume use.
4.0,The tie is beautiful. It is just a little narrow. I thought it would be wider.
4.0,very nicely made and great cut.
4.0,I works awesome smell a bit funny when it first arrived
4.0,They are soooo cute and work perfectly for what i wanted them for.. but dang they hurt after a while
4.0,The stud is too good. I gifted it to my mom and she loved it :)
4.0,"I love this bag and have gotten a ton of compliments. I have even shared the link with many co-workers, as we need clear bags in corrections.  Unfortunately, with our recent cold temps in Wisconsin, the bag cracked when I attempted to reach into while still cold. I also notice a pen punctured the lining when outside in these cold temps.  I would buy it again and be more cautious."
4.0,"This is a nice cap, and I really like it, but why is it called pro combat? Nothing about this cap has anything to do with combat. It's a skull cap - nothing more, nothing less."
4.0,Very pretty but the Rose quartz looks clear. You can barely tell that it’s pink
4.0,"The material is a fine soft thin cotton with a lot of stretch, so a size can fit a wide variety of figures.  I bought the large and I am 200 pounds older.  It fits great but I wish it was a couple inches longer.  I don't want to bend over in it but I love it as a nightshirt!"
4.0,I usually wear xl tops cause of 36DDD's. Ordered this in XXL. Unable to close it. Not stretchy. Gave to my daughter who's size medium and she loves it.
4.0,Is what it is..
4.0,These are key for my kids being in school. The issue is that sometimes the plastic fasteners fall off the lanyards because they’re attached to the mask
4.0,Cute swimsuit for the price
4.0,"It fits rather nicely but... when here is a large butt involved, the lower half doesn't really cover much. So cautious when buying for a curvy body."
4.0,needs more room in the butt area but still cute though
4.0,"These were really nice looking boots. We did have to return because there was damage to the toe of the boot, but it coildve happened during delivery. The seller was quick to refund. we ordered the blue , and I really liked this color...a deep blue. The heel was a solid chucky heel and the boots were soft sueded material. we will reorder these."
4.0,I got my friend and I pairs and we both love them! I wore them out and got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I used these for a cheerleader costume, and I've worn it a few times. I'm 5'4&#34;, 150-160 lbs. Size 8. I have big calves, and these stockings fit fine."
4.0,"This shirt is always good for a chuckle! Shirt hits at hip and is a little snug for XXL (my typical sizes are 36DDD, L-XL,14/16)- but nothing a little stretching out with your hands won't fix. Distressed wording is nice, but doesn't hold up well after a few washes. Photo is taken after approximately 3 washes."
4.0,"These are definitely cute, but they were way too big for me. I'm going to return them. I wish they would've fit, because they really are cute. They seem to run big, though."
4.0,I usually wear a medium shirt and these were significantly small on me in medium size; the sleeves ended 4 or more inches above my wrists. Fabric seems fine and construction seems good; just need to buy larger than expected.
4.0,"El producto me llego al día siguiente esta tal y como lo describen, a mi esposo le encantó le pedí XL le quedo un poquito grande pero esta muy bien hecha duro unos minutos con el y ya estaba sudando, ahora vamos a ver cuanto tiempo le dura. En cuanto a las medidas yo les recomiendo que pidan su talla ya que yo estaba pensando en pedir una talla más grande pero no se los recomiendo la tabla de medidas es casi acertada 👍👌"
4.0,"I’m sad and happy about this purchase. The quality of the tee is nice and the graphic is nicely done as well. But it’s way too big. I looked at all the reviews. I checked the sizing charts. I compared body shape/size/height/weight. All signs pointed to a medium. The shirt looks like an L/XL, it is a loose fit.<br />It’ll be a hassle to exchange so, I will end up gifting it. Even though I really wanted this one."
4.0,It didn’t fit over my hips but if I pull it over my head it works very cute goes to my ankles and I’m 5’7 size 18/20
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but possibly a size or two too large. Fortunately it will be easy to alter."
4.0,NICE WEAR ON ME.
4.0,"If you're short like me (5'3&#34;), you'll probably have to roll them up at the bottom. They're cropped but they fit awkwardly on my calf. Not bad at all for the price."
4.0,"Daughter loves them so I will place 'likes it &#34;.  She had  the same style {prior to these for 2 seasons}on sides & loved them til' they feel apart, reason I really  searched & searched for same type ( diff brand ).  Gift opened, and delivered with One of the buckles had a chip in the boot  buckle on sides, she noticed instantly, but loves them so she didn't want me to send back. No biggy, nothing a same colored sharpie cant fix ;)<br />** very warm!<br />** seams look good"
4.0,Work well but not great.  Didn’t fit tight enough.
4.0,Love this but since I'm currently in the process of losing weight I&#34;m going to keep it. It looks too good on me just a tad snug. For the price it's worth  it anyway. Hopefully I fit into it soon!  :D
4.0,Hello ladies! Ok so I was skeptical about ordering this dress mainly because I wasn't sure what size to get so I just went w a 3XL just to make sure it fit and It was too big. (A fact I am very proud of btw) lol..anyway let me just say it is very very stretchy and the color that I rcv'd is more of a Cherry red not a burgundy like I ordered..I will let ya'll know I am 5'3 and 220lbs normally wear a size 16 pants but instead of returning it I will just have my sister take it in at the waist and hips because returning stuff is just too much of a bother for me and not usually worth it. The price is cheap just work with what u got right?! lol hope this review helps...did not give this 5 stars because I do not like the material it's made of but live and learn ...and I'll still wear it so whatever..let me know if I can answer anymore questions always ready to help!
4.0,Very nice cover. I like it.
4.0,They were for Halloween but I am still wearing them.  They are pretty good till about 30F if you are active outside.
4.0,"I love Peace of Foot's boot cut hiking socks, I wear them almost exclusively. These are not as nice, and the material does not wick sweat as well, but they're still better than any generic hanes/andys/fruit of the loom socks I've worn."
4.0,I liked it alot!
4.0,"Cute, but the gift hasnt been opened yet, so I am not sure if my granddaughter likes it."
4.0,"Beautiful colors, fits well in my wallet and arrived promptly."
4.0,Arrived as promised. Product was as indicated.
4.0,Shorts  were too big WAY TOO BIG. But the top was PERFECT. Love it on my 2 year old
4.0,I have received compliments on this necklace.  It is well made and beautiful.  I could recommend this product.
4.0,The knitting is very thick but the bottoms could possibly fray more if it gets caught on something.
4.0,"I originally purchased this item for a 90’s themed dance party...but they’re so cute and comfortable that I’ll most definitely be wearing these as often as I can. The sizing, as most other reviews say, runs small. I’m in between a 16 and an 18 dress size and usually buy an XL in tops. I ordered these overalls in a 3X and they fit great! A nice baggy fit. I probably could’ve gone down to a 2X but then the legs may have been too snug. I am very happy with this purchase and, depending on how well they hold up after the wash, I’ll buy in other colors."
4.0,"Very cute bathing suit for my toddler. Only problem is it’s a little see through. Other than that, it fit well and is adorable!"
4.0,Fit well and relax ankle previously broken with out excessive compression.
4.0,"Cute, but too print was a little too large, you could barely see it all without me turning."
4.0,Love the earrings they are my favorite.
4.0,"Great bag! Lots of room. Only wish it did not have a center divider. Would have preferred just a large open compartment, but that's just me and otherwise I have no complaints!"
4.0,"Didn't look exactly like the picture, but still nice earrings"
4.0,"I'm 5'11&#34;, 220 pounds, 48&#34; chest, 36&#34; waist, not exactly skinny (!)  and this reaches all the way down to my knees, nearly covering them. The description stated &#34;stainless steel&#34; but I really doubt it as it's VERY magnetic. It does have a shine to it, the chain are just closed loop and will come apart with any kind of impact, so it's just for costume use although it is VERY heavy as well. For me to use it I will have to remove at least a foot of the length and the arms are just barely to my elbow although quite a wide opening. For the money they are decent, again, for costume purposes, would NOT use it for LARP or combat of anykind."
4.0,These are good. My only complaint is I have small feet and there is extra material around toes.  I wish the colors were a little different but these are ok.
4.0,"Acceptable for a small, inexpensive locket"
4.0,Beautiful! Definitely want to order other colors!
4.0,Just got my jacket today.  I ordered a 2xl but it's a little snug.  It's not so small that I can't wear it but I thought it would be a bit bigger.
4.0,Love them but rather messy to dump & refill! Work perfectly!
4.0,"A friend of mine recommand this goggle to me. I admit i like the design of the connection on its back rubber strain with a plastic button. After three times using, i found that the goggle  went well at the first time. But the second and third time,  water mist exsit after several turns swim. I not sure all goggles have this phenomenon or something else. 70 point with full marks of 100."
4.0,Works like it said those sometimes the straps will slip out of the 1 side. Would be nice if they were a little bit tighter but definite improvement over not having them.
4.0,It is still big
4.0,Nice ear cuff.  Seems to fit well and the variations in coloring gives it an antiqued look.
4.0,"Swen well. A bit on the small size, but ok."
4.0,I like it. But I ordered three sizes bigger than I wear. Because it runs really small in size.
4.0,"Love the fit! Not the best quality, but really cute."
4.0,Slightly thinner than expected but still a great purchase
4.0,They are thicker than I expected.
4.0,Bright white and looked great. I had to return due to not needing them anymore though.
4.0,"Nice comfortable dress ,a little tight across the chest ,will get a size larger next time."
4.0,The product looked good and looked good. Many of the comments stated one should move up one size because these briefs tend to run small. I moved up one size and they are too large.
4.0,"It's cute, very fragile tho."
4.0,"This is a cozy, but fashionable sweater for the winter! I went for a size larger than I normally wear, since I have a long torso, so it wouldn’t be too short! It fits perfectly!!"
4.0,El producto es de buena calidad solo q me quedo un poco grande
4.0,"Bought the socks for my sweetheart. They look really cute, but have a hole in them near the top<br />:("
4.0,"It's super quality material and cut. It's a very nice piece. I just hate how it looks on me. The color blocks don't work on me, or at least these colors. It makes me look boxy and weird. I'm average height,but have a long torso and limbs. This would probably work better on someone with a short torso and limbs. Spmone will be super happy with this donation!"
4.0,"I read the reviews and I ordered up. I usually buy L in our sizing, I order 2xl and they're too big. I wear size 12 pants, and these barely do anything as far as holding me in. They are certified granny panties, but I already knew that. I will say that after I wore them 12 hours my tummy was a bit tender, at first they seemed like a good fit, but after washing them I realized I ordered too big. Not their fault, the product is still good, but order up 1 size, not 2."
4.0,Flattering high waist dress. Everything fits like a glove. The material is a little scratchy after the first wash but I love the way this dress fits on my larger chest and sits high on the waist in a flattering way.
4.0,"I ordered an XL since most people said the dress ran a bit small. I usually wear a L, I’m 5’6/160 size 8-10. The dress fit nicely, the bodice underneath was slimming although it did ride up. It wasn’t an issue though because the top layer of the dress kept me covered up. For the price it was a great find."
4.0,"I ordered these PJs are part of a birthday present, and they were cute, but not very soft. The birthday girl still loved them, so I guess fabric quality isn't a key factor when you are 12 months old and obsessed with Minnie Mouse ;)"
4.0,These tee's are good quality. Wash before wearing.
4.0,"Did not fit as expected, but very pretty"
4.0,Nice looking dress. The stretchy material is form fitting and looks great. The V neck is not too low. I'm a 32D with a 27&#34; waist and ordered a small. The waist fits perfectly but this size can take a lot more bosom for bustier gals.
4.0,"I like this bracelet. It was a great price, and looks very nice. The part of the ring with the stones is heavy, so the stones often turn to the bottom part of my wrist, which I guess would be expected. One of the jump rings is not soldered shut, which I'm disappointed about, but most of them are soldered. I really love this bracelet, and am considering buying a second one, and having it made into a necklace."
4.0,"My Mom is pleased w these socks. She's not a large person, though I ordered L-XL she found them difficult to put on. They are &#34;compression&#34; socks😁"
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; and got a medium in white, it fit perfect, a little see through in some place but a very pretty dress."
4.0,"I received a red medium which I usually wear, but it a little snug.  Also it is 95% cotton, and I thought the color would be red and white, but the white is a cream color.  I'll still enjoy it, so I ordered the green in a size larger and it fits perfectly.  The green one is 95% polyester which is what the online description says."
4.0,I really like this shirt for the price. Make sure to order up a size.  Runs small and will shrink if dried in the dryer. Overall happy with the purchase!
4.0,"As described by others, a nice, tight fit.  However, realize these are more like calf-length tights (thin, translucent leg covering) than opaque capri slacks).  Especially with the white leggings, I strongly recommend wearing only with a long top or tunic.  Unlike the photo, I think exposure of the crotch area is not a good look (to put it bluntly)  Also, as someone else mentioned, there is a funky elastic waistband that makes these look like a pair of long johns.  However, works fine under a long tunic."
4.0,"This is a pretty piece, but find it's sort of big. Haven't been able to find a chain that suits this piece. Will continue looking until I find one. I like it, but hesitant to wear it."
4.0,I get so many compliments when I wear this dress! It's soft and comfortable. I only didn't give it 5 stars because it is slightly see through so be careful about what you wear underneath!
4.0,Good fit and feel. Seems like the material is designed to retain its shape.
4.0,Came off in the rain in a matter of minutes
4.0,Only four-starring this because my nanny kid set the alarm that goes off every hour and I'm not really sure how to turn that off.
4.0,Received this item yesterday. I like it but it does run big. I’m glad I bought a small and not medium that was recommended. I wish this item was offered in an XS for a better fit
4.0,Easier to get on than regular compression socks
4.0,"I'm sure I just didn't play close enough attention, but these are much bigger than I expected them to be, I bought them for our 15 month old, and they're way too big. I gave them to a 3 y/o that we know. Darling though...well-made and great colors (shown)!"
4.0,It's a nice jacket for the price. A bit cheap but you can only tell up close. Fits as well as I'd hoped.
4.0,"I purchased these for my mother who has been prescribed compression socks.  They appear to be well made with great independent support.  To insure she was able to get them on, I ordered the largest size available (XL).  She claimed she could not get them on so I tried to put them on her and they were so tight I couldn't even get them to stretch enough to go over her heel.  I know the objective is support but too, it's lacking enough flexibility to put them on an averages sized person.  Since she is unable to get them on, I can't share a wear review."
4.0,A little big on me but i can live with (I’m a 5’1and 110 lbs as reference) that but the quality of the fabric is kind of cheap so will see how holds it after being iron it or washed and can be dry in the dryer .
4.0,Good fit just wish the fabric was stretchier.
4.0,Like the elastic bust
4.0,Started carrying this bag as soon as I got it.  Love all the compartments..especially the 2 little side pockets.  Keep my cell phone in the zippered one.
4.0,The only problem I have with these glasses are the screws continue loosen up to the point to where they are coming out and I have to get the eyeglass tools to screw them back in. Otherwise they are great!
4.0,"These are a nice medium-weight pair of socks. They are soft and comfortable to wear. They don't have as much padding as athletic socks, but would work great for casual or business activities. Good for both indoors and outdoors, depending on the temperature. Great for spring, summer and fall."
4.0,Runs tight around the chest (I'm 5'4 -115 lbs and it fit good elsewhere just in that area tight) and and rather itchy where the lace hits at top.  But overall comfy and looks cute on.  It won't be a keeper long term for great night of sleep but still cute.
4.0,Will keep your hands warmer than most gloves but for some reason just your fingertips will freeze when it's cold enough. The touch screen finger works fine and the palms are very grippy.
4.0,A little small but it fits !
4.0,"Dress fits as expected. A bit long however it's  expected as I am 5'2"". But overall I love it and have received many compliments on it"
4.0,These fit well and they are adorable. I bought these instead of the Robeez because of the price but they are now just as expensive. In a little under two months the price went up by 40%
4.0,I like it but a little small.
4.0,Looks really nice. Fits well and really like the pink band. Keeps great time.
4.0,Came with a mark on boot. Looked like boot and part of the packaging got too hot and it discolored a part of the boot
4.0,Size too small compared to other snap backs. Great quality & material
4.0,Thin. Very thin but beautiful.
4.0,I’m 5’6 and even with 2 inch sandals I need it hemmed. Very pretty dress!
4.0,These are so fun! I wish the bars were a bit longer but other then that they are good!
4.0,"I really liked this dress. It is pretty and comfortable. It fit well. The reason that I didn't give it 5 stars was because there are very sheer strips on the bodice that I wasn't very fond of. Also there was a little &#34;bubble&#34; at the seam on the right side, which is the reason that I am returning the dress."
4.0,Beautiful sunglasses but too big for my face.
4.0,"I ordered the alpine one a very pretty blue and the back colors are really pretty, but on the left front side there’s this big plastic feeling state of Alabama, the covers your whole boob, and it’s so white your eye is drawn to it, I can only wear it at home or a coat covering it, “why so big on a woman’s shirt”? I love tha pastels, but afraid to buy them since they don’t show the fronts. The quality of the shirt seems really nice."
4.0,"Arrived as promised and described, but is large enough that I wear it as a nightshirt. Washed beautifully!"
4.0,I gotta give it to them I guess. The scarves are pretty but I returned mine. I was looking for real silk. I am no silk expert but I did test it by running it through a ring and it did bunch up. And the feel of it is not soft. It feels a little coarse.  Anyway. This tag was on the scarf and when I looked up the area codes on Google both said they are spam. When I looked up the lady on Twitter it also did not seem professional.<br /><br />Other than the pretty image I wouldn't buy this.
4.0,They are great looking and comfortable but the strings don’t hold for long and you’ll always be tightening them and some don’t work at all and so if they made better tie strings they would be the best cause they look great and feel great and the only thing wrong with them is the tie string.
4.0,Love these shoes! Very comfortable
4.0,"wore this to a wedding and got so many compliments. definitely runs large, i got a small and it was fine. very comfy and cute, keep in mind i’m small chested. exactly as advertised. had to sew on a new bottom bc the little pearl fell off as i was getting ready though."
4.0,'Tis fine.
4.0,"Dress was pretty , No longer needed it"
4.0,"I’m a pretty solid size large in most items, but something told me to order up a size on this dress. I’m glad I did, because it’s a little tight across the chest. I’m a 36DD, and an XL is usually too roomy, but not in this dress. It’s big in the waist, but not enough to make it look bad. The material is VERY thin, so if you live somewhere other than a hot climate and you’re thinking of ordering this for fall, don’t. It is the middle of September here and it was nearly 100° F today, and I could have worn this 3/4 length sleeve dress without breaking a sweat. Laundering instructions are dry clean only. It’s still a cute dress, though. Ignore my footwear in the picture...fractured 5th metatarsal. Bah. I call it “the outfit destroyer.”"
4.0,The style of this shirt is very casual so i didn't mind that it was on the larger size. It is very soft and looks good on. I ordered it in a large but I could have gotten away with a medium. I suggest if you like your shirts on the smaller side you order a size down. It won't be skin tight and it will still have that loose casual look but will be a much better fit
4.0,"I had to return the dress, even though I liked it, because it's not true to size. I'm 5'2"", 150 pounds and it's too tight in a Large. I think I'll buy again in an XL."
4.0,My niece loved this bracelet. She collects turtles and it suits her age (12) and style (Earthy). It was nice quality and easy to put on and adjust. I would buy this again for one of my other nieces.
4.0,Beautiful and well made. My broad athletic shoulders -could barely get it on. I ordered the M but will be returning for a L. Made for petites
4.0,"I like the price, wish it had pockets"
4.0,This was adorable on my son. The material was really stretchy so was easy for him to crawl in.
4.0,"Nice fabric, looks good, but the waist is quite tight for a large, and there would be too much skirt fabric if I ordered up a size.  This probably is fantastic for someone with a smaller waist vs hip size."
4.0,"The ""black"" striped one is definitely navy. I even got a replacement & it's still navy. Most people probably wouldn't care either way, but I was buying this for a Puglsey Addams costume for my son so I was really hoping for black. They should update the product description. Still a cute set of shirts that fit well though."
4.0,Affordable and comfortable for the price softer then I would have thought it would be. Lots of lose threads at the ends of seams. But would and probably will buy again when this one needs replaced.
4.0,"Although this is cut as a standard Kmart 3x pant, it runs small in comparison with Amazon 3x , so  it is too small for now. The print is destinct , unlike many prints on this fabric type. The fabric is better than average, but is double the price I usually pay . The leg length is also very long , possibly for a 5foot 8 or taller individual. I think they would work well for men or tall boys  as well as women."
4.0,"Very light and fragile, but helps with equestrians and feels very comfortable for my eyes"
4.0,I like that these are things and heavy duty. They come with straps to carry as well which is a bonus. Really don't have a dislike so far. They kept everything dry even when sitting in water.
4.0,"I'm 5'1 160 lbs, and usually wear large or 14, I ordered this in Extra Large and glad I did. I fits and hangs very well.  Think I will also order the green color. Material feels comfortable"
4.0,This is a great deal for the amount you get! I always get compliments when I wear these. They aren't very high quality but they are simple. I only didn't like how some of the chokers got folded in the packaging and it wouldn't look good on until they were flattened out.
4.0,Nice. Fits perfectly. Soft material.  Will form lint balls on it quickly.
4.0,Adorable and my daughter loves them.
4.0,My girls loved this necklace!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, but not for women with thick thighs !  Shoulders and waist  fit fine but the butt and hip area is quite snug which makes it even shorter!!!"
4.0,overall happy with the purchase.  a plenty of room for my 3 year old with a size 9. the shoes iitself is a bit heavy though.
4.0,These shoes arrived quickly and look very nice.  The only negative is that I haven't been able to figure out how to keep the shoe laces tightened.
4.0,"This bad is SOOOO CUTE and exactly what I was looking for. BUT...it does smell weird and the smell is hard to get rid of. I tried dousing it with  Febreeze and perfume to no avail. I’m afraid to wash it due to the reviews of it falling apart. I’ve had it for several weeks now, rode with it for lots of miles in the wind on a motorcycle, and it STILL smells funky. 😷"
4.0,I was getting it for church and didn’t realize the cherries on it LOL if you get what I mean
4.0,I had bought 4 from Walmart and love them.  I hope you will get more so I can get other colors.  They were less expensive at Walmart but I was willing to pay a little more.
4.0,Does the job. Comfortable and provided the support I needed after surgery.
4.0,"Decent enough quality... the hooks are rather rough on the ends and really big compared to most of the other jewelry I have bought.  Quality is what you would expect for a lower price... but I'm pretty disappointed that the price dropped shortly after I purchased them.  Kind of wish I just went to the store and bought some.  I really dislike how people move the prices around on here.  It was at least a 10% decrease from when I bought them.  They were uncomfortable enough that I only wore them for a few hours and only 1 day, but I can change out the those ear hooks for a better style and use them more next year.  Cute, but I'll just find the pieces to make these myself next time.  Very simple!"
4.0,"It wasn't hard plastic so could break easily, the mask was that kids face mask quality. The battery clip could be a bit better too, it kept falling off.<br /><br />Great for pictures and last minute Halloween idea"
4.0,"Used Goggles for Eye Protection not swimming<br />I used these goggles for eye protection after eye surgery and they worked well to protect my eye from water when taking a shower. However, I did not use them for swimming so am unable to comment on that use. For my purpose, these goggles were a good value."
4.0,"Super cute! Fits well, it’s long and it fits my arms as well too. It’s not too tight or too short in length as far as my arms go. My chest area is larger than average which causes the cardigan to open a bit more than I expected."
4.0,The color was lighter than expected and a little large.  Thankfully the ties in back helped achieve the fit fairly closely.  The bridesmaid on the right is pictured in a different style of this same product.  She found her neckline a but droopy and  unflattering and wished she had chosen my style as well (c)
4.0,"It's already small, but it shrinks really easily. Everything in my house is dried on low & this shrank despite being washed in cold & dried on low."
4.0,"I bought 3 of these as Christmas presents.  The chain was shorter than I would have preferred for myself and the hour glass doesn't really work (when flipped, the sand dumps rather than trickles) but the Harry Potter fans loved them."
4.0,"I normally wear a large, but wanted a more curve-accentuating fit so I got a medium. It fits well, hides my tummy that I'm working on reducing, doesn't over-expose my my cleavage but definitely still gives the girls some flirty play. I got the black, so I hope the color holds up through washings because this will definitely be a go-to. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because my good coverage bra is peeing out of the sides. Fine for when the bra is the same color, but I'll have to wear a half tank to cover that when I'm wearing another color bra. Also might not be a problem for bras for a less-busty bosom. I plan to get two white ones, to tie-dye one of them and wear the other as-is."
4.0,The cufflinks arrived on time and they look a lot better in person
4.0,"it's cute and I love the message, however fits tight and is super cropped, like a sports bra. wearing it inside out looks pretty cool too, because the colours are inverted like white letters in a black text box, kinda like captions"
4.0,Perfect for newborn baby pictures. Loved it
4.0,Beautiful apron after a 3rd wash the ties became frizzy and unraveling. Love the protection when cooking.  But for the discounted  price I guess it’s ok. Not happy about the unraveling wish it was better quality.
4.0,Very nice jacket....fits well and looks good.....good for cold days.....with sweater or sweatshirt good for freezing days
4.0,The dress was the winner of the event I attended! So many compliments on how beautiful the dress looked. I felt beautiful...
4.0,"It's cute, but I have every intention of making this shirt a little shorter because I think it's too long. I'm not sure, but I think the yellow of the shirt dulls the melanin strips a bit, but I still like it."
4.0,Great watch when I first received it though the day display was having trouble switching to the next day but after a little figeting I got it to work other than that it's been working very well I have yet to try swimming with it though
4.0,"very cute but much smaller then expected, had to give it to a different child then I intended"
4.0,it came a bit large than i thought but good quality and cut i love it
4.0,"I really like them. Its really long, not too long, so your mask doesnt hang directly on your chest. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was bc the clasp doesnt open enough so that I can use one or two on my glasses. I would recommend."
4.0,Perfect size on me
4.0,I'd give 5 stars if it didn't have the emblem on the front.  That damn thing scratches the hell out of my phone.  I'm too lazy to change my ways so i will continue to put both in my front pocket.  I do love the size and quality so perhaps this product deserves 5 stars and i deserve 4.
4.0,I really like this coat in the color white.  I ordered a 1x and it fits slightly larger than expected but not too noticeable.
4.0,"Love it, but not a perfect color match to my rose gold Apple Watch"
4.0,delivery was fast fit well quality was good
4.0,"Cute, a bit heavy but not bad. Glows really well."
4.0,The socks seem to be comfortable.  I am anticipating continued comfort.
4.0,"We used these glasses with 5 year olds for a spring performance.  All the glasses looked and fit perfect on the children.  However, they can't handle the pull and play of the children.  We had two break because the kids were tugging on them.  For the time and event needed they did the job.  Just not good for those little hands that want to put them on and off."
4.0,Love the shorts!  Fit as expected and are very comfortable.
4.0,This is my third purchase of colorfulkoala leggings. The fabric is so soft. This pair unfortunately has pilled where the others have not. Still like them but that’s a bummer. :(
4.0,"These are some of my favorite leggings, the pocket is great and I love wearing them for work especially when I have to clean! They are high waisted and fit great and have no areas that are sheer or even close to see through. My only problem was when I got them they had a super weird smell to them that wouldn't go away. It took a bit of fabric softener and downy unstoppable sent boosters to cancel out the smell but other than that I have no complaints. Would probably buy again in the future!"
4.0,"Bought for my mom. She likes them as they are very light and can be tossed into the wash when dirty. These do not have a hard sole, the sole is the same material as the rest of the slipper. There is no anti-skid on the soles at all, but that can be added easily enough. Overall, a bargain at 3 pairs for $20."
4.0,"This is a gift so I don't know how it'll fit. It's summer in Australia so this will be perfect for the weather. The material seems thiner than I expected but appears to be well made. It's really pretty and I know she will love it, it's floral."
4.0,These are very nice reading sun glasses but they get scratched very easily.
4.0,Fit very well. I added a petticoat to make look fuller. Love the dress
4.0,"The glasses are great and this seller represents them accurately!  My face behind the lens makes me look like I could stand in for Mrs. Claus.  That isn't the fault of the seller and they arrived in a timely manner.  I like the glasses and on the right face, they'll look cool ~ not old lady-ish.  And, I do not mind old lady-ish. But, Mrs. Claus-ish when it is nowhere near Christmas could confuse young ones in passing. Tee-hee-hee.  Little tiny joke, here. They're good quality glasses and the seller delivers them promptly. Thanks."
4.0,Run alot smaller than exoected. My daughteris andusually wear size 7 so i ordered a size 10 and they fit my baby who is 2. I love the material and.color though.
4.0,"We bought this shirt to announce the arrival of our second child. The family loved it!!!<br /><br />My daughter is big for her age, so we bought the next size up. It was the right size, but I was afraid that it would shrink in the wash and be too small. Luckily, it didn't shrink and she can still wear it."
4.0,will send back and order next size...they may run a little small!
4.0,Product as described work great for my son they fit him great
4.0,"I like these leggings, The fit is a bit odd, a little tighter in the waist than other brands and they seem long or bunched up. But overall great for the price."
4.0,Product should be thicker with softer material I'd pay the extera dollar for that but other than that good design and extend length of band a bit
4.0,"White dress<br />I am usually a size small and it fits super well! I love the material of the dress, but I am 5’3 and around 130 lbs and it is pretty short goes to about 5 inches above knee length. But it is Super comfortable and super flattering for a summer/spring dress! So i would recommend if wanting a cute summer dress but not for formal occasions to short and casual."
4.0,Love it. So comfy. Color is not truly maroon/burgundy but more of a red.
4.0,It was a little small  but it is pretty
4.0,"I’m really happy with my purchase. I got it for a ceremony and I’m sure it will be perfect for the summer. I like the length of the skirt and the colors, exactly like in the description (I got the burgundy/fuchsia top with the roses on the skirt). The only thing is that I wished the top would have been more fitted or at lest the material more stretchy so that it would be tighter. I have a smaller waist so I think I’ll wear something around it to cinch it a bit, as now it doesn’t really accentuate it much. Anyway, lovely and exactly like in the picture."
4.0,"Cute, looks like the pic. Can’t comment on longevity just yet, wearing on vacation so I’ll update later."
4.0,"I originally ordered a medium and it was very small and a bit difficult to get on. I am 5ft 3"" 130lbs and I do like my hoodies a bit baggy although this was small even for a fitted look. I returned and ordered a large which works much better and fits more like a smaller medium. I have washed this several times and it does not shrink and washes well without loosing it's softness. I really like the feel and once I got the right size I have been very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Very pretty dress and just as pictured. After reading other reviews, I ordered up a size from what I normally would get and made the right choice. I'm 150 pounds and got the XL. The slip is one size fits all and was definitely too small which is why I've reviewed 4 stars."
4.0,This was cute but way too large. The waste needed something around it to make it not appear so large. I always wear a medium but should have ordered a small.
4.0,"Very cute top; very versatile.  Runs a little small around the top portion and high and a little, not snug or tight, but rides close to the neck.  I would by other colors, I love the navy."
4.0,Other than the writing on the side for the price its ok. Looks neat on my daughter's feet and she loves it. Seem to be comfortable too especially for play time.
4.0,"Very soft and cozy, well made."
4.0,Oversized is right ! They look a bit dorky but great coverage and the lens seem good.
4.0,Absolutely love it. The only down side is that the best friend part is upside down.
4.0,"Very pretty, but hard to tell it's made from rose petals. Gave as a gift so I felt as if I had to explain."
4.0,"had to trim down a little.<br />there is no give to these, will make you taller for sure, but support is great.<br />for instance, they wouldn't work in vans or converse, you foot would slip out, but for athletic shoes they are great.  They are so sturdy they make your boots a little tight, so if your boots are loose fitting they will be fine."
4.0,I love it for pumping at work and even t&aacute;ndem pumping with little one. It is Great to have both hands free but still wear a comfortable bra. Especially when your large chested and bras are hard to find.
4.0,"This was purchased for a girls cooking get-together and everyone liked them a lot.  They were fun and functional too.  And one size does fit most - easily up to size 14.  Since they only tie in the back, they really worked well."
4.0,Good shipping time and they look good and so far sturdy
4.0,Got these for girls nite at Grandma Net's . Wanted to match up with my 9 grandaughters. We all loved them.
4.0,My wife is a small lady and this thing is still tight. I love it but she thinks it’s just a little snug.
4.0,I really like the shape and size of the glasses. Not Harry Potter size but don't overpower my whole face. The supporting pieces on the bridge of the nose dig a little into my nose and the ends of the glasses are a little sharp so I have to be careful when putting them on. Other than that good buy!
4.0,It was an okay watch. Does the job as expected
4.0,Omg are they comfortable. Size was right on. The only down side to these jeans was the  2 months to get them
4.0,Love them.  They are small in size.  Lightweight.
4.0,"This Outfit of Shorts feels nice and Cool, Soft and definitely gives you Padded Protection where you need it when riding your Bike. They’re made of 98% Polyester and 2% Spandex, which means they will dry within Minutes of getting Wet, especially when you’re out and riding around. They Air dry within Minutes of leaving your Washing Machine, if you put them in an area with Fresh Air flowing.<br />  Personally, I’m torn because they would’ve been a great thing when I was a Kid and my tiny Seat on my Bike was Solid Plastic but, it feels like I’m wearing a Full Diaper when I have them on. I don’t mean to be Gross but, it’s what I feel. I figure that, as with much in this life, you will get used to it and the Benefits will outweigh the Odd feeling.<br />  I think they’re made well though and Rating this Set by that, I would say they earn 5 Stars but I need to pull 1 or 2 simply because, it should have a personal feel too and like I said, they feel a bit weird to me."
4.0,This is a beautiful bag. The only issue I have is that the area that holds credit/debit cards is not zippered and I don't feel comfortable having them unsecured.
4.0,"Belt it cheap, but dress looks very nice"
4.0,"I am very please with this bathing suit!! I love the openings, they are not to exaggerated! It fits very well! I know its a bathing suit but it was very well made. I received this product at a discount to give an honest an unbiased review.  I am very happy I was able to review this product ."
4.0,"Arrived on time fits comfortably, needs to be tied tightly to stay in place but doesn't restrict vision."
4.0,Like the looks.
4.0,"These are crappy cheap sunglasses, but a little better than the ones at the dollar store. Functional and disposable. Not durable. I would buy again because I'm a cheapskate who loses sunglasses."
4.0,it was cute because I could dress it up with skirt or down with jeans. I love this crop top.
4.0,"Reviews for several color variations of this bracelet appear on the same page. My review is of the purple bracelet.<br /><br />This is a simple yet interesting design for a bracelet. The gems are clear and bright, though they are clearly made of crystal and not actual gemstones. They are much better in quality than a rhinestone since they are not colored by reflective backing material, but the facets aren't as intricate or reflective as curated or authentic gemstones. The gems in some of the settings on my bracelet sit slightly at angles. It's not the sort of thing you'll notice unless you are carefully inspecting the bracelet.<br /><br />The metal is made of brass according to the description, which some people can have reactions to and it will turn their skin green depending on skin pH and soap/lotion types. I don't have any reactions so this did not color my wrist when I wore it. However, if you are reactive to brass, then you may want to consider that before purchasing this. I'm guessing this is actually what is called &#34;nickel silver,&#34; but I can't be sure. The silver coloring is shiny and has a nice patina. There is a polishing cloth in the box to help keep it looking good.<br /><br />The packaging on this for the price point (currently about $20) is amazing. It elevates the presentation of a modestly priced gift to another level. This would make a great friendship or secret Santa gift for someone who likes to wear jewelry. It is pretty, not terribly expensive, and has an accessible and versatile design that is appropriate to wear in a lot of settings.<br /><br />Note: I was given a sample of this product for my assessment."
4.0,Somewhat large but still comfortable
4.0,"Good quality but these are hard to put in, I thought they’d be the kind where you just push the jewelry into each other but these screw on. Which makes it kind of difficult to put in as these things are pretty large so the jewelry like pushes against my head and i have to pull my ear super far away to be able to screw these in."
4.0,The product is pretty and fits great.
4.0,Cute but wash cold do not put in dryer hang dry.
4.0,Good quality for the price. My daughter loved the multiple colors and fun shapes used to tighten them from behind.
4.0,NO problems here
4.0,"The material is super soft. I didn’t give it 5 stars because the bottom of the romper doesn’t have an opening; it is enclosed with a zipper on the inside, but cannot be opened."
4.0,Kinda feel like i could have made this myself...
4.0,They don't stay in your ear. You need to add a back.
4.0,"I bought it to wear with rose-embroidery jeans, and with a good blouse it's a fine between-season topper."
4.0,"I thought the hat will be bigger with more room to put my hair in, but it's just a regular one with a tiny bit of empty spade at the end of it. Still wearing it tho. At least it keeps my head warm and the crochet is nicely done."
4.0,"Not a bad wallet, kinda flimsy, and didnt really feel like real leather... but cute. My son loved it."
4.0,They are a lot smaller than I imagined. They were too tiny for my septum. But they are great quality. I just need 10 mm instead of 8.
4.0,"I ordered 2 of these shirts last week.  They are super comfortable and fit well, but they are fairly transparent.  You could clearly tell what undergarments I had on underneath the shirt.  I will need to wear an undershirt with them, but they are otherwise great."
4.0,"I used this dress as the base of a costume, and it worked well.  I would not have worn it without adorning it, though.  It fit very well, but just wasn't flattering on me."
4.0,Hard to reach on button
4.0,"It’s nice, soft and warm.<br />Of course it’s „cheap“ material so you gotta wash it after wearing once, it really makes you sweat and the seems are not worked out that well. I also wish It had pockets but for the price you’re getting a cozy, comfy, cute looking (quarantine) outfit!! Would order it again!"
4.0,Not a Bad Belt!
4.0,"While the bottom area fits snug (I actually wear a woman's 4-6 or a juniors 9), the top and mid section gapes enough to have to alter it before I could ever think of wearing it out. That being said, I love the uniqueness of this suit and I'm still glad I purchased it. :)"
4.0,Nice cute simple hat but the color (grey) was too light and fuzzy.
4.0,Love everything about it. Chain is useful and light
4.0,The sizes aren’t really true to fit. You need to go up one whole size or it will be too small. I purchased my nieces actual size and was too small so I shopped it back and got the larger size.
4.0,"Nice product. Arrived quickly. Wash before first use. Pure cotton, so folding won't be perfect. Thank you."
4.0,"Happy with product. Very pretty earrings, nice colour.<br /><br />However, very slow delivery."
4.0,Light comfortable and you have to love the way the world looks through polarized lenses.
4.0,"Purchaced this dress for Christmas. Cute dress. Little short in the torso. Fits true to sizing(ordered Large) Needs a petticoat underneath to fill it out. It has a sort of plastic silk feel to the fabric, it's soft and not uncomfortable though. All in all, good dress for the price, shipped quickly, and was as expected."
4.0,"Good quality, but the sizes run a little too big."
4.0,The hoodie feels soft and good quality for the price. But runs big. I’ll have to go down a size. I bought a 3xl normally a 2xl. I’ll get the 2xl to see if it’s good for me. READ THE SIZE CHART.
4.0,"Runs big. Bought a large because I have a 38D chest, but I could have gotten away with buying a Medium because it’s loose in the stomach area. I’m hoping it shrinks a little in the wash. Otherwise, it’s a great shirt!"
4.0,Somewhat smaller than other yoga pants in this style. Good thing for me my daughter is a size smaller than me and she loves them. It's the reason I gave it only 4 stars...be aware this company runs small.
4.0,"Cute top. I like it a bit looser so I bought a large, but the large fit a bit snug. I’m a 36D."
4.0,It was pretty much what I thought. I read all the reviews and loved the pictures. So I will now do the same! I am a 5 '3 1\2  weigh 145. Size 8. I got the XL based on the measurements. Now to see if when I wear ut holds shape!
4.0,Fun and sassy. Fits a little big.
4.0,"I love this shirt but it does run a little small. I was worried that it might not look good on me because of my size, but it looks very cute with the camouflage jeans that I ordered!"
4.0,"Very stretchy, so fits very nicely with some leeway in fit (I wear a size 6/8 and ordered a medium so it wouldn't be too snug and it fit very nicely). I was just not a fan of where the waist sat on me, so I returned it."
4.0,My daughter needs it for a play so it was great fro the price.  When it came I was nervous it would be to small.  She is a true medium it looked like an extra small.  Luckily it is stretchy she can get it on over her head and it will work but I would recommend ordering a size or two bigger.
4.0,Its elasticity is really good. Fits comfortably. Arrived on time.
4.0,Love this.  You can change the color and be very stylish.  I have received a lot of compliments.
4.0,Cute basic dress. Fits as expected.
4.0,They run a bit small but other than that they are great for keeping the little ones feet warm during the winter.
4.0,This wrap was decent I just wish I ordered the 4M instead of the 3M. It would've been perfect if it included the little loop that the wrap pulls through to keep it secure. 7/10
4.0,I just love this sandal!! Its comfortable and love it that it comes in different colors I got the all versatile Black!! Use it with anything.
4.0,Fabric thinner than expected....
4.0,"These zippers are great for larger boots, but they were a little too long for my motorcycle boots.  My boots come up about two inches past my ankles, but these zippers are too long.  I didn't really pay attention to the ""8 Eyelet"" part of the product name, but in retrospect it shouldn't be a surprise that they don't fit my boots since my boots only have 5 eyelets.  Duh.  My mistake.<br /><br />I used these for a few days though and they seemed very sturdy and well built.  The zippers were very stiff though.  On one of them I could barely zip it up, which defeats the purpose of a quick-secure system like this.<br /><br />One other thing worth mentioning is that these shipped from the vendor in England to my home in L.A. and I received them VERY QUICKLY.  Despite the fact that they really didn't work out for me, I have to give the vendor high marks for quick and reliable service."
4.0,"It is accurate and a nice looking watch, but an adult size. My daughter is 10 and the size of her wrist is about the size of the watch dial, so it got to be closed on the last hole. It might fit properly if your child is chubby."
4.0,Just one of the bracelets broke putting it on the first time. Making a necklace out of the lava beads from the broken bracelet.
4.0,Perfect for 50's dress-up day! My 8 year old loved these when she rocked her coordinating pink ladies jacket.
4.0,"Like the dress - lightweight and comfortable, great for warm months.  I'm 5'3&#34; and it  drags on the floor when i wear flat sandals.  I tie a knot in the front (as shown in one of the product pictures) so i don't trip on it... I don't mind too much that the bottom slightly drags."
4.0,Dress looks great on but a tad big in the back and needs something in middle to take away seam look like a belt or something otherwise very cute !!
4.0,"I wanted to add a review to contrast the 2 negative reviews. I knew these were silky when I ordered them, and I knew they had a high slit, as shown in the photo. As I am short, I am going to need to wear these with high heels, and I just haven't had the opportunity to go somewhere fancy yet. I think heels will also help change the look of the material from (possibly) cheap to fancy, though given that the price is under $10, well, they will only look so good.<br />When standing, the pants provide full coverage and have a nice flow."
4.0,"Even though I wasn’t too sure about the fit because it was tight around the chest area- overall, I’m glad I bought it. I added a belt to it to give it a little more shape. I wore it for my birthday brunch and I received so many compliments on the dress!"
4.0,"I liked this dress and got a lot of compliments, but unfortunately as soon as I zipped it up the zipper on the front popped. I had to wear it unzipped, which is fine, but if I want to wear it a bit more modestly I am unable. You get what you pay for. I am busty, and this has a lot of stretch and give but the zipper was cheap. I can probably get it repaired if I really want to."
4.0,"They fit well, and are so similar to Victoria Secret bomb shell. You can't tell the difference really. I wear them all the time. Great price, great fit... I would definitely buy again. They r not as soft as VS, but not to bad..."
4.0,VERY THIN BUT STYLISH
4.0,"It is an adorable dress. I purchased it for a professional networking event. I received lots of compliments. My only complaint is that I had to tug at it constantly which is not something you want to do while networking. It kept sliding up because the material couldn’t grip my pantyhose. Other than that, I’m really pleased."
4.0,Super Cute and just perfect for my sister in law who loves cats!
4.0,"This is actually a very beautiful watch, but it only lasted 3 weeks til the battery died. Recommend to manufacturer to put in new batteries before you mail it. The back had to be professionally removed to replace the battery which cost me more money.<br />Still, it’s a nice weight and looks good.<br />Just please don’t send almost-dead watches."
4.0,"I've been using long shoehorns for years.  Previously I only had the plastic kind.  Then I stepped my game up to metal.  It was a game changer.  Then I realized I needed one for travel.  Enter this device.  It folds up easily.  It stays extended via a locking system that works well.  You can even unscrew the head and use it for a monopod.  This was a 5 star item in my book until I came across almost the same item but with a pivoting head, so you don't need to remove the head for travel.  That slight advantage gets that shoehorn 5 stars and makes this the runner-up with 4."
4.0,Great Capri work out pants. I thought the waist band would be wider. They are just above a standard waist band. I own a pair that has a larger one. Overall great fit and does the job
4.0,I use these for fishing to minimize the need for sunscreen. I like the weight of these on my arms and they fit snug so I'm not constantly pulling them back into place.
4.0,"Would have preferred a bulkier leg warmer because I like that look, but these are quite nice.  I have thin legs so I had no issue with sizing, but if you have heavier legs you may want to read all the reviews from those folks."
4.0,The shoe is a bit stiff but looks very cute.  Somebody will look grand for her birthday!!
4.0,"The Romwe Summer Sleeveless Floral Printed A Line Dress in Wine is very cute. The armholes are cut ever so slightly like a razor back style so it shows a little more shoulder than a typical sleeveless dress. It is very comfortable and hits right at the knee.  Based on the size chart, I ordered a Medium. It fit well except for the bust area...it was a little snug.  I'm 5'4"", 165 lb and 36DD. Returning for a Large. Otherwise it was very comfortable and stylish.  I would say it in just a bit longer than shown with the model which looks to hit above the knee. This one hit just at the knee. Color is truly what I would call ""wine"" (some would say ""burgandy"")"
4.0,"I'm 5'2 and it's long on me. I found it to run a little large so get a size down. Other than that than, it's a pretty good item."
4.0,"A little larger than expected but i don't mind, still fits good and is a good sweatshirt for the price."
4.0,Comfy and cute but short by the waist and arms
4.0,"My son was due for some replacement titanium necklaces and I just can not see paying $25+ for a sports necklace.<br />Finding this one was great because this also happens to be his schools colors!<br />He has been wearing this every day since finding it in his stocking, and I am so far happy with the colors and quality of clasp."
4.0,Very cute. A little tight in bust area.
4.0,Ordered 2 sizes up and fits great.  Happy I read reviews.  It's a silky type material so it's pretty lightweight. My kid is thrilled so I guess I'll give it 👍
4.0,"I loooove this bra. Super pretty, great support, first bra in my size that wasn't ugly or super expensive. I'm happy.<br /><br />Just needed a clearer size conversion."
4.0,"It's a form fitted dress, so I ordered a size medium. I'm 5'5&#34; and 130lbs.  It is a thick, sweater-like material. Very cute!"
4.0,"cutest beaded phone chain I could find on Amazon, but kinda chunky."
4.0,"I bought two pairs of these this winter and they did keep me warm.  I have a hard time maintaining a steady body temperature, so these were perfect for wearing under long and short skirts and to sleep in, depending on the night.  They did, as I would expect, tend to stretch out and fall down after  long day of adjusting.  This is an indication of quality more than anything.  The only thing that is hard is that dogs and cats like to scratch at the very cute pompons on the tops (held up with a strand of yarn) and used as a tightening cord. Also, the pompom is a good way to tell what is &#34;up&#34; side.  Sadly, if you are lazy and don't pay attention, it can be easy to step on the pompom yourself.  It's not a big deal, but the poms are part of what makes these &#34;cute&#34;."
4.0,Pretty but thick
4.0,"very comfy, very flattering. Not the highest quality fabric, looks inexpensive and casual."
4.0,The earrings are very pretty and sparkly!  I wasn't happy with the size of the backings.  They were very small and I had to buy larger sized ones.
4.0,They run small so order one size bigger
4.0,Good quality for the price. I’ve been wearing it for 3 months. Makes my belly button a little green but still looks good lol
4.0,"Loved what I saw,  just to big.  Will order medium"
4.0,Love these socks - I didn't read carefully so didn't realize how much I was paying for one pair of socks.
4.0,Love them... Especially the bottle opener.
4.0,The reason for the 4 stars is because in the description it says it's a knit cap but when I received it's actually 100% polyester and really thin material not what I expected
4.0,I pretty much expected it to be to small for me but my little cousin will love it as a birthday gift 🤣
4.0,cant beat the price
4.0,"Watch looks really nice, all dials move, truly mechanical. The only gripe is that the watch needs to be wound every 10 hours or so or it will stop and you won't know the time. Also don't use in shower, it will get water on the inside."
4.0,"Nice selection,  for well"
4.0,"Perfect for giving to my bachelorette party attendees for our adventure to a natural rock waterslide. Super lightweight, awesome dark lenses, but scratch super easy. Still definitely worth the cost!"
4.0,"I am a bigger girl. Like 5’8” and about 200 lbs, so I bought a XL dark blue dress. It’s so cute! It definitely needs a fashion belt of some kind, but the cut is flattering and it fits well on me. Color is pretty, matches a lot of things. I may buy a teal version of this dress in the future, it really is that cute. A word of caution, though, to thinner people: If you don’t have an apple shaped body like me, you might wanna size down one size, otherwise great!"
4.0,Bought these khaki shorts for the summer. I needed some shorts that are comfortable and I could wear with a collared shirt so I can wear it to work. It looked great and it fits really well. The quality of the khaki shorts were a lot better than I thought. It is very durable and the material feels nice. I would recommend this product.
4.0,"With all modesty, I think of myself as somewhat of a sock expert, having worn many, many varieties of sock over the course of 68 years. Once I made the mistake of buying black socks to wear to work and then some navy blue ones for variety. It made doing laundry a nightmare because the laundry room in our building was dimly lit and it was all but impossible to tell the black from the blue.<br /><br />Well!  I finally retired and now I wear various shades of sock -- light blue, royal blue and green. They are easy to tell apart, which has helped me ease into a comfortable retirement.  And then...it happened.<br /><br />I put on my socks, and as I was about to put on my shoes I realized in horror that I was wearing the right sock on the left foot.  Or rather, the wrong sock on the left foot. (See photo.) Then I saw that I was also wearing the right sock on the right foot. That means that tomorrow, I will have to pretend that I have two left feet."
4.0,"The dress is great, the only problem I found was the fact the dress was sheer but for the price I didn’t want to return it so I bought a slip to wear under the dress and it fixed the problem! I also got many compliments so overall great dress. For reference I am 5’2 135 pounds and 34C and I bought a medium."
4.0,I liked the weight of it and it was lined. I knew I would have to alter it when I ordered it.  A little off the side from the hip down and quite a bit off at the hem. I am 5’1”. The price was good so it was worth it.
4.0,It's adorable but it runs just a little big but my granddaughter is also a bit small so it's hard for me to say size wise but hopefully for early spring it'll be perfect. It's adorable and will be so cute on her!!
4.0,"I am a 33 1/2 bust. I ordered a small and it is tight in the bust.  I was going to exchange it , but my husband liked the fit.  I still may, but all said, it is so cute. Very tropical."
4.0,"I expected some fun, cheap, earrings that I could wear without worrying about losing or damaging. These are exactly that! They are just a little flimsy and you have to bend the back to get them to snap shut, but again… they’re exactly what I expected for the price. I would definitely recommend! The sizes are all noticeably different, and the gold is shiny. Just keep in mind the price tag when you’re buying — you get what you pay for!"
4.0,"Love the color and fit but don't really like the ""waffle"" fabric"
4.0,"Super comfy pants, appear as pictured. The only thing to note is that there’s a ton of extra fabric on the upper leg area. I can pull the fabric out 18” from my legs lol. I like them though..."
4.0,"Its a xl that fits like a large, but very good quality!"
4.0,Beautiful but the beads are sparse hence the go to one side leaving you wearing only the “snake”. Should have added more beads.
4.0,"This dress pleasantly surprised me! I'm 5 1/2 months pregnant and I bought it because in the pics it looked like it would accommodate my ""bump"" and it did not disappoint! Also the length was good, I bought an XL to make sure it would be big and long enough. I'm 5'11 and it reaches my feet. Very comfortable. Would definitely recommend!"
4.0,"Beautiful brown polka dot skirt can be dressed up for evening out or running errands. The material is thick, which is good as it is not see through, very flowy, and light to wear. The pleated look hides the tummy or any stomach, which I love. I also love that it has pockets. If you are on the shorter end of 5"", the skirt will be a little long, but other than that I love this skirt and planning to wear it throughout the summer, fall, on vacations, and anywhere really as it is really comfortable, easy to pack, wrinkle-free!"
4.0,Nice and roomy. Has multiple pockets. It's too big for my preference but will be perfect for my mom.
4.0,"Pretty! The 'wings' on the back aren't as tight to the skin as seen in photo, but still fun."
4.0,"Fit was good,a little bigger than expected."
4.0,"OMG! BUTTERY SOFT!!! I love these yoga pants, they are super soft and comfortable. They have just enough stretch amd they fold over at the waist. The bell bottom style is flattering and the length is perfect. I am 5 foot 4 and they are not too long. I can’t say enough about the comfort and soft feel of these!!!they are a thin drapey material."
4.0,"Fit is large, but high quality and my son loves them!"
4.0,A Christmas gift for my son.  I received it in a timely manor and he loved it!
4.0,u gotta wear this. so cute. so comfy.
4.0,Very cool for props & costumes. Not 100% realistic looking but darn close to it
4.0,"The outer box is really worn.  However, the watch box is in good condition as well as the watch itself."
4.0,My mother in law loves it. It is smaller than I thought but really pretty.
4.0,"Well made watch band, would buy again."
4.0,"Cons:<br />1. Slightly stiff when first wear it, therefore not very comfortable when I first wear it on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />2. Looks pretty good, not flashy, simple design.<br /><br />Overall: I bought it for my Luminox 5121, looks great on it."
4.0,Fits great around the chest but is a little too short for the size I ordered. If I was to order again I'd order a size larger.
4.0,"The polka dot dress was cute, but way too short, hitting about 3 in above my knees, Spent a one long evening extending the hem, because the party was in 2 days. Otherwise, well made. I did not have a problem with popping open buttons. I bought the right size by using their size chart and my measurements."
4.0,"First off, I like larger shirts - but within reason!  I ordered an XL and I could have easily got away with a L.  I wore this to work yesterday and I’m not gonna lie, I was warm and comfy all day!  It is made of sweater like material.  I also like the 3/4 zipper, pullover look - I just wish it had a kangaroo pocket!  But I am sure I will wear this again in the future!  However if I knew better, I would have ordered a size down to have it just a *tad* more fitted!  When it did arrive, I had to use my steamer to get the wrinkles out of it, so prepare yourself for that.  Also if I raise my arms up, it tends to come UP too (which I saw someone else mention in a review).  I wore high waisted shorts which kept my midriff more covered.  I also think over the course of the day that the weight of it made it less likely to do that - because I didn’t notice that issue toward the evening!<br /><br />In a nutshell, it’s a good item to have going into fall/winter.  It’s appropriate for my work settings.  I will continue to wear it and see how it holds up, but it seems like a solid item so far!  I just wish I had gotten a Large, however this won’t stop me from enjoying it this season!"
4.0,A little rough to get on my head but I adore them!
4.0,"Ordered this shoe as a 10.5 which was the largest size available. I usually wear a 11.0, the shoe fits fine."
4.0,"Can never go wrong with Puma Shoes, always GREAT Value"
4.0,"Cute lightweight summer dress. The print design could be better and it's very, very short, definitely not safe to bend over even the slightest while wearing this."
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; 33 inch bust, 27&#34; waist, and 36&#34; hips, the dress is soft and comfortable and size small fits really well. The sleeves are a little tight though, but not uncomfortably so. You might want to consider a size up if you like looser sleeves, but either way I really like it and would buy again in another color :)!"
4.0,good quality. have not used yet due to warm weather but cant wait to wear out. it is something different but not too crazy
4.0,Adorable!! I am 5’7 and have D breast...it sits at the perfect length on the ground for me! Barely touching!! Love the color (i got cobalt) but i will say it is quite see thru!! Finding something to wear under will be tricky but I am up to the challenge!! And it has pockets!! Adorable!
4.0,"They are pretty,  for what they are."
4.0,Pretty . Got compliments on it first time I wore it
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable! This is a cute casual bell sleeve top. It looks and feels well made. The material is similar to a thermal shirt and on the thinner side. Keep this in mind as lighter colors may be sheer. I live in a warm climate so the material is ideal. The one downside.. mine came with a very strong patchouli type fragrance. It smells like either a) this was a return, or b) this came from the boho type store that typically are very fragrant. It’s not damaged so I am keeping it but the smell was quite strong. Definitely cannot wear without washing. The fit was on the smaller side. I’m typically an extra small, I ordered small and it fits perfectly without being too snug."
4.0,"If you want to wear the contour roam on your head or a hat this works. The mounts are best for helmets, but for other situations this works well enough."
4.0,I wear a 12. The length was perfect (I'm 5'2) - it hit right at the knee.  It isn't see through at all.  The arm openings are huge. I have to wear a tank underneath to hide my bra on the side.  Straps are thick enough to hide bra straps. May want to consider a bralette to wear with this.
4.0,Good to have if you work in hôpitality business
4.0,"quality bands,thick and strong."
4.0,Nice style and quite comfortable.
4.0,Love the color of the fabric but a little bit too big around the hips But a great product
4.0,Pretty nice for the price. Love the color and it fits nicely.
4.0,Love the form fit. It was above my expectations. Great buy for the price
4.0,"During the COVID-19 self-quarantine lockdown period, I spend a lot of time working from home. And I don't really want to wear something too dressy, instead, I want something that's still good looking, but more functionally more importantly, lightweight and comfortable. So, I ordered many Goodthreads clothings, from polo shirt, to hoodies, to this Men's Lightweight French Terry Crewneck Sweatshirt.<br /><br />I've just recently discovered Amazon's own brand in Goodthreads line of clothings, I've absolutely fallen in love with them.  Being of Asian/Pacific Islander ethnic decent, most of the shirts and/or hoodies I buy, the clothing may fit my body perfectly, but the sleeve lengths tend to run to long; and I really hate to having to fold it over at the wrist areas. My belief has always been: the clothes should fit me, NOT the other way around! With Goodthreads, as seen in the attached photos, you can see the sleeve length fits my arms perfectly. And because it's made of 100% cotton fabrics, it's so comfortable; so I wear it everyday and everywhere, working out, light walking, or a quick shopping trip. This sweatshirt also comes tag-free and with elastic ribbing at the hem and cuffs so it looks very natural and doesn't get bulky. I'm 5'9"" and 155 lbs (COVID-19 weight, I typically weight about 145lbs) but I still ordered a SMALL , because I know I WILL lose the weight once my exercise routine picks up steam as I used to. If you're not the slender physique type and need a little longer sleeve lengths, then I'd definitely order a size up.<br /><br />On the other side of the ledger, not enough to remove a star since it fits me so perfectly, I'd have loved that the fabrics contains a little (~5%) Elastane fabrics for a little stretchability from its elastic nature which can provide an even better fit and more comfort. BUT, in all, this is a very comfortable, fitting and pretty good looking no frills everyday sweatshirt.<br /><br />💞💓💯💪👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💪💯💓💞"
4.0,This was not my purchase
4.0,"I love the feel of the dress, soft, hangs well…I have to admit tho I didn’t  care for long tail on the dress soo I cut it off and hemmed it…I love it now!"
4.0,"Okay so, I LOVEEE the design and how it looks. Only downfall is the a lot of the crystals were falling off :\. Wish they used some better glue or something to hold them in place."
4.0,Bought for my husband and he really enjoyed the item
4.0,Perfect size and my phone fits perfectly
4.0,my granddaughter loved these socks - they look well made - colors were vibrant - size is true to size
4.0,They are comfortable and professional looking
4.0,It was a very cute outfit.  It does run a little small.
4.0,"These glasses are great for shows. The double lens of the refraction lets you adjust how much detail you want to see and don't want to see, which is great depending on your mood when you're using them. I'll let my friends of sometimes strangers use them if I feel like they'd enjoy it, the reactions I get from them are almost priceless and already worth the money.<br /><br />I do think the glasses could be better made since they tend to get a lot of abuse at music festivals and may break if you're not careful, this is why it gets 4 stars vs 5 stars.<br /><br />But amazon's free prime shipping and free return make this an easy purchase if you were thinking about trying them out."
4.0,These are very pretty but be aware the metal is a more of a rose gold color. They were a nice weight and great for the price.
4.0,"Satisfied with the fit and fabric, I just wish they had pockets."
4.0,"It feels good. It's not too tight though but at times you can tell something is pressuring on your mid section. Overall, I do like it. Soft material- well made!"
4.0,This dress is very pretty. The lace detailing is so delicate and beautiful. I bought the white XXL but I never got a chance to try it on because the zipper is broken. I’ll be sending it back.
4.0,Very disappointed this top did not fit. Loved it.
4.0,"Very nice... especially for the value!  I would recommend this item for people looking for a nice medallion, but on a budget."
4.0,It was good quality. It didn’t turn my Skin green when it got wet and it also looked great
4.0,"I initially thought this purse was way too big, but once I put all my stuff in it, I realized it's the perfect size. The color looked a little different than what I was expecting, but am overall happy with it. The only complaint I have is that I wish there were more pockets or more space in the pocket on the inside."
4.0,"These are perfectly sized, but some of the designs are a little corny. Good value for the price."
4.0,"Great product I feel like these sandals because of their bottom construction are massaging my feet. It feels very comfortable to wear them during the day, my foot is not sliding inside, the rubber pins inside are massaging my feet but also protect from slipping it.<br /><br />Although I have noticed that sometimes in the morning right after getting out of the bed I can not wear them because it's painful to my bottom feet, maybe feet become sensitive, little swollen right after getting up from bed, i don't know, but this last just for the couple minutes after woke up.<br /><br />I still do recommend this product."
4.0,"Maybe that's what I should expect for long sleeves but I find this material to be a tad hot at night time. These would be great for lounging around if anything, but not sleeping if you get easily."
4.0,It's very comfortable and feels secure driving any workout.  It's pretty sexy too.  I love it.
4.0,Very beautiful! Was givendors to my sister as a gift and she loves it. I will defiantly be buying one for myself. Would be 5 stars but it is a little bit thicker than I thought. Still very pretty.
4.0,You have to have a certain size head for them not to leak
4.0,Great boot. I have slim calves and the fit was not too big. Just enough room for jeans or leggings to fit inside. For added comfort I would suggest inserts.
4.0,"Very cleavagy. Make sure to pin, sew, or wear an undershirt or your bra will hand right out. Not appropriate for work as is. I've turned it into a sleep dress because of the comfortable material though."
4.0,Good product but too small....hard to purchase shoes online without trying them on...
4.0,I like the feel of these gloves. I think they will be good to use in handling slimy fresh caught fish and may give cut protection as well.
4.0,"Pretty stiff so not very comfy, but it is super cute"
4.0,"Shirt is absolutely adorable I love it. However you can tell that it is not made well. Some of the fabric strands are frayed at the hemline. With that said, if you hand wash it the blouse should last longer. If you throw it in the washer I'm pretty sure it will fall apart. But for the price, it's well worth the purchase."
4.0,Pictures don't show true color. Navy looks gray. I bought two but am returning one because it is blue/navy and orange and I wanted gray. I bought the red one as a gift.
4.0,Came quickly and they work! They are strung a bit loosely but I can always retie the elastic more firmly later.
4.0,Material wasn't bad but doesnt look like pictures
4.0,These head coverings are very versatile and can be used all season long.  The different colors also adds to its attraction at a great price.
4.0,A bit narrow for my large head. Good quality product however.
4.0,Good product. Just buy a smaller size.  Re-order a median size.
4.0,"I bought these as a joke, but ended up being really pleased with them! When I was young, I used to get these at novelty stores. They were pretty flimsy, and pretty small. These were a good size, and seem a lot more sturdy. Great for a ball game on a sunny day!"
4.0,They look very similar to Uggs but much better price! Very comfortable! If foot is wide I would go up a size.
4.0,The white is a butter yellow. So disappointed with the color and it is too big. Returning it and going to order in a small and in Black.
4.0,"Cute, but a little cheaply made. Worked good for what we needed it for and was a good price."
4.0,"The top fits as expected, the pants seem a little small"
4.0,I was looking for a graduation gift for my 14 yo niece. I wanted something classy but it had to be reasonably priced since she has twin sisters graduating next year and I'd buy similar price point gifts.  I loved the stylish and mature design.  I purchased a few watches for her to choose from. This was my favorite-and hers as well.
4.0,"So cute but I wish that the robe was longer for tall kids. I bought this for my friend's daughter who just turned 10. She's 5'5"" so these are short on her but she LOVES the robe ( it is so soft) and her American Girl doll wears the matching robe."
4.0,"I love the flow of this dress and the pockets.  Length is perfect, I'm 5'4"" and adjusted the straps.  Hi Low hemline is great.<br />Fabric is light but not sheer.  Will be ordering different colors."
4.0,"XL size is too big for my 13 y.o. son (height - 173 cm), good quality."
4.0,This dress was cute and priced well.  Worn while at Disney.
4.0,"The material is different than I expected, its kind of silky. Kind of."
4.0,Holds up very well in a busy kitchen setting
4.0,"I love the material it is made out of. It is sturdy yet flexible. It is rated for a 19'' laptop however mine only fits if I keep the bag relatively empty. Otherwise, great backpack."
4.0,"Granddaughter is really into these things.  I liked this sue to daintier looking. Very durable, but connectors, being necessarily adjustable, got lost quickly."
4.0,I didn't like that I didn't have any holes for you to breathe through your mouth through
4.0,The top is really cute on this shirt but it was a little tight fitting and very thin. If you wear jeans you can see the button outline. I may repurchase but one size up.
4.0,The fit was as expected and performed well at the gym.  2 of the 3 washed well. One of the shirts started to shed the thread in the seam (under the arm).
4.0,Very roomy and has a few little pockets for organization
4.0,Very pretty band. Came with the tool to modify the straps length to adjust. Just have the issue that the button to unhook from the watch are too easy to press so if you are not paying attention the watch may become undone and fall. It has happened to me a few times already but I like the band so much I still wear it with it all the time.
4.0,"Shoes were fine in quality and materials. It was suggested that you pick a smaller size as they are not for running. I consistently wear size 12 in brooks, and have had several pairs this size. I chose size 12 these as well and they were tight. I thought I could manage, but I think I will have to give them to my brother. If the sizing was consistent, I'm sure I would have rated them at 100"
4.0,"The fit and finish on these sandals is great, however, I recommend buying a size that is one size up from what you normally wear. I would give it five stars, but my size wasn't available to truly try on."
4.0,"Please mske bigger sizes, it almost fot but was just gonna be irritating, kooked so coooool though!!!!<br /><br />Make bigger sizes!!"
4.0,They came in the exact color I asked for (which is hard to do) and there were two pairs in the box. the only thing I will be changing is that they came with the plastic almost gummy backs that don'ts like to hold on right.
4.0,Our Harry Potter fan loved it.  She wore it on Halloween 🎃 nice touch to her costume
4.0,Seems like good quality material. The sad part was that I ordered a red satin and the color turned out to be more of a dark red/burgundy color. It's a pretty color but not what I needed.
4.0,I order both colors only wish they were a little more thicker. Really thin material.
4.0,"This shirt fits, but its not as loose as I had hoped. Wish I would have sized up. Quality is Ok. Has held up through several washes."
4.0,"It is a little too large, but great for lounging at home, so I kept it"
4.0,"It's a decent hat. Feels durable. The hatband though was a disappointment. It was attached offcenter with a very messy glue job. Switched out the band and carefully cleaned up the glue and it's much better. Resistol's quality control seems to have gone downhill lately overall. The hat did feel a little big but not enough to return it and downsize.<br /><br />Over all, I wouldn't buy it again but it's good enough to keep."
4.0,I loved this jumpsuit the only issue I had was the length in the lower regions area. I’m 5’10 and since it was a little short in the torso area it bunched a little at the bottom even though my torso isnt extremely long or out of proportion. The length to the floor was perfect though and it even touched the floor which I’m not really used to. All in all it looked good and I got a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I like the scarf, fabric is OK, but cheap (as expected). Design is clear and vibrant"
4.0,"Real cute, but very little.  I purchased this for my young granddaughter for Easter and I did not notice the size.  She will grow out of them in a few years.  Otherwise they are real cute for now."
4.0,"Nice s***, would buy again, however faded and shrunk slightly after first wash."
4.0,Love this bag!!!! It's bigger than I expected.
4.0,For the price it is a very cute watch!
4.0,"Great for the price but the toe did come apart from the sole after about 2 months.  And the front was easy to scrape up with my active kid, but they are so cute and she loves them!  Totally worth the price."
4.0,"Super cute and nice. They are comfy too! They do not come on the cardboard hand holders like in the picture, they come in a bag. ANd the long pair is much more longer that the pic too. Pretty good tho"
4.0,I love it! Especially with me black glasses
4.0,My kids love it. The pouch helps them keep it properly on their own.
4.0,Very low cut and slightly loose up top. Had to wear an undershirt.
4.0,"Pretty design, but too sheer. They got snagged pulling them up. They are see through, so that made the run in the stocking more apparent."
4.0,"5'2 190lbs 38D |  Went for the XL - soft for the price and if I could have kept the shorts themselves I would have, they fit nicely. The top was far too large, fit more like a 2x."
4.0,Great jumpsuit to keep the baby a little extra toasty on windy days.
4.0,They're nice. I like them.
4.0,Got these for my father in law and he loved them the initial does give it a fancy look only thing is on one of the handkerchief the color of the R was smeared a little bit other than that it’s a great gift
4.0,"I was tired of the steel, gold, and sterling silver earring backs.  I was constantly losing one and could not find a suitable backing. Or I would lose an earring due to an improper fit of the backing.  These work wonderfully,.  They are clear, so you do not notice them.  They fit tightly, so I'm not losing my earrings.<br />I love them, but would like to try a little longer clear one because these backings are very small."
4.0,Like the color and shape. Very roomy with pockets inside and out. Also included 4 prep bowls with lids and ice packets
4.0,"Good bottom coverage, top fits nicely. Ordered a small. I’m 5’4”, 135lbs, A cup. The top could probably fit up to a large B cup. The suit is red and blue, the picture looks black, but it will be cute for summer! The quality seems decent, I haven’t swam in it or washed it yet."
4.0,Very cute my 4yr old can slip these on fast when we are in a hurry
4.0,"I kept reading the reviews that this coat runs small. I'm 5""4, 132 lbs, usually a size medium. I ordered an XXL based on the reviews...and it's way too large. The XXL is about an American XL. It's a cute coat like the pic. I like it. I'm exchanging it for a large, because I want it a little big but not huge on me."
4.0,Little small maybe but I have learned about buying Asian size stuff. But still feel very sexy wearing them and they look very sexy on !!!
4.0,Worked for international flight
4.0,"I wore this dress with a pair of black leggings to an office holiday party and a family Christmas gathering and got a lot of compliments. It's a fun, festive dress, that was very comfortable to wear. The dress moves well, so I was even able to bowl in it with no problems."
4.0,Love this bag perfect size. The color and design is nice
4.0,"It fits well, and feels expensive"
4.0,"Cute purse. It bothers me a bit that the front flap is off centered which is why I'm giving it just 4 stars. Otherwise I'm happy with it, it fits my wallet, keys and phone. I use it when I don't want to carry my giant duffel of a purse, just throw a few keys items in the purse and off I go. The material is really soft which is nice and the color is rich. I love with the off centered flap, lol."
4.0,"Color is great, fabric does not have a lot of stretch.  For fit info, I am 5'4"" and weigh 158.  Got an extra large.  Fit everywhere well except for the bust area.  I wear a 34G bra and I did not fill the space.  But it was fine for a 50's party and I got lots of compliments."
4.0,"I bought the ""black mosaic"" to match the same two-piece summer pj set. The material for the black mosaic is soft, cool, and not too thin, in my opinion. I have several of their pajama sets: The flamingo is cute but very thin material.<br /><br />Reviewers are correct in that the bust area opens easily. The cure is just to stitch a straight line down the button front. You don't miss using button as it works as a pull over.<br /><br />Also some people say the pj material is too revealing around ""company"". I'm using this ""night gown"" more as a cover up or robe. It works well in that role, and then I don't really care what the button area does. (The button holes are okay on mine.) Very comfortable and cool."
4.0,They are very cute. But I don't think children's size. Too big
4.0,works well for the price.  the velcro strap comes loose at the end.  not a huge issues and stays attached to my wrist.
4.0,Great shirt wish it was a little longer in the front.
4.0,"This is somewhat fitted for men, not a regular men's fitted tee. Good quality and nice design."
4.0,"Are just as good as the ones you find for $15 at the gas station, but way cheaper. Haven't broken yet, and they do a good job of blocking the sun."
4.0,bit pricey but awesome wallet.
4.0,I love it although it is a bit short when laying down (on beach towel or chair) it is very cute though and an awesome deal!
4.0,"I was very pleased with the service. The earrings were lovely, however bigger than I had expected. But it will be given as a gift, if the recipient is happy. Then they are perfect."
4.0,"I bought my &#34;Spy&#34; while working in Iraq for 5 years...2005 to 2010. It was used for a work watch and as a Field Watch. Personally, I would take this watch over a Timex Expedition anytime. It is tough, accurate, and Very Durable. I did not treat this watch gently. At the end of 5 years, It only has some minor scratches on the dial. The only things this &#34;Spy&#34; has ever asked for, is a new band to replace the one I wore out. And a change of its 3 batteries, which lasted about 2 years. I am literally wearing it as I write this Review... It may outlast Me!"
4.0,Very pretty really likes them period giving them a four-star because a few of them were scratched when they got here. But definitely something fun for the price
4.0,The light really sets this bracelet off!  Very shiny and it compliments the wrist.  It takes patience to get it hooked by yourself.  Still love it!!!
4.0,"Why are the sleeves soo wide?? I also don’t understand why women’s robes aren’t cut for a woman’s figure...I personally feel there should be a slightly wider, A-line cut that would be more forgiving on both the hips and to prevent any flashing. I kept it though because it’s very soft and perfectly weighted. The above problems I have found with nearly all Women’s robes, not just this one!"
4.0,They stain easily
4.0,"The quality of the tie is very good and feels premium, the issue is that the price also suggests premium while it doesn't carry a brand name which would support the price. I felt that the quality of the tie was comparable to higher end brand ties that I have and loved the color."
4.0,"I like it, but it is completely see thru. So now I need something wear under it."
4.0,Cute very thick and rolls up
4.0,They fit okay.  The main issue is that they slide down the pockets are deep.
4.0,Nice dress. Fit really good.
4.0,"Absolutely loved this product, the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was simply because the wallet collected dirt very easily and there is no real way to clean it. Other than that I love all the compartments. I used this because I was a waitress and it made it very easy to keep my money and tips separate but in one spot at the same time. Would definitely look in to buying this product again."
4.0,"Material is very stretchy and flattering. My only issue with this drrss is the collar. It stands up too high. I have a shorter torso so maybe that's the problem but I'm going to try to size down. I got an XL following their sizing chart but with the oversize bust/shoulders and stretchy fabric, I think I could size down to a L."
4.0,I love this too definitely one of my favorites.
4.0,"I’ve tried this style before and I like it. This bra has no underwires (YAY!), it’s very comfortable, and I don’t get as sweaty in the heat of the summer. I’ve even passed it off as a cami. As long as the bottom of the blouse stays closed, you can’t tell it’s a bra. I absolutely love the color, so I’ll be doing that a lot.<br /><br />However, the inserts are beyond ridiculous. They’re just molded, foam half circles. Unless you fit into them perfectly - highly unlikely because they only vaguely resemble a female breast - you’re going to find that the space they slide into is way too roomy. They tend to slide around freely, so your breasts stand a good chance of pointing in different directions, like the eyes on an iguana. But they’re easy to remove and trash. Or you can maybe use them in crafts.<br /><br />One star off for the inserts, but I still like the bra! It gives me enough support and it’s comfortable, and that’s what’s really important to me these days."
4.0,"Unfortunately this shirt runs small. Maybe 2 sizes too small.  It's a really nice shirt tho.  I really like it, but had to return!"
4.0,"Do not be deceived. This is not a big heavy winter scarf to get you through the worst the season has to offer. That being said, it is comfy and cute. The quality is solid. And for many, that is all you will need it for. I received one of the checkered designs, and I am absolutely in love with the style. Other than the scarf's innate cuteness, I love the size. I would call it oversized, both long and wide, so you can double it pretty well with ease and accent your outfit in an array of ways. This is definitely a winner.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"they are a bit long for a Monroe. However they came in pretty colors, and I haven't had to tighten mine up in two days! Fast shipping."
4.0,"Some parts fit really well (from the waist down it was even a little big) but some parts were way too small (right under my bust). I did like the corset so I'm disappointed.<br />For reference, I usually wear a Size 12 and wear either 34DDD or 36DD bra."
4.0,"My son really enjoys these slippers. They are very soft and fit great. The only problem we had with the slippers were that the round grippers on the bottom kept coming off and we'd find the circles everywhere throughout the house. Now that they are done &#34;shedding&#34; those, they are just fine."
4.0,I loved the blouse. I bought it for a 70s theme party and figured I could wear it again. The colors were the same as the pic. The only downside is it shrunk a little after washing it. Now it's too tight on top. I got the 2X
4.0,The color is beautiful but it is just a tie dye patterned material that is 35% cotton 65% polyester. Not warm at all but it looks nice if you're not getting it for warmth.
4.0,"Its awesome, the colors are vibrant, looks like the picture, the material is great quality. I have prime so the shipping came in two days. the fitting is accurate to sizing chart. im 5'4''  145 pounds medium build. the fabric is stretchy enough to fit comfortably in the right places and the zipper is quality too. ill post pictures soon!"
4.0,They seem to help with pain but cause my legs to itch really bad
4.0,The bracelet looks very nice.  Can't some top wearing it.
4.0,"Works for my son, he likes it."
4.0,Cute bathing suit. The top has a lot of lift. I didn't put the padding in the top. If your well endowed be aware it isn't extremely roomy. It pushes everything out there. For my body... it would have gotten 5 stars if it had a lil more space in the top. But if your looking for a boost it would probably be perfect. I rated it a four BC its a super cute suit and overall fits nice.
4.0,I listened to the reviews.. And ordered larger. But would of fit as expected.
4.0,Love this bra. Fits great. Nice price.
4.0,"I was nervous about buying XXL shoes -- I don't wear XXL _anything_, but the sizing charts are OK.  XXL fits a US 9.5-10.  (It might be small for a 10.5, but the uppers are stretchy so the main question is whether the sole would run all the way from toe to heel.)"
4.0,This is a great outfit for the gym. I am a 34D so I got the high neck dark gray outfit and I love it. The sports bra is medium support. I could have probably went small in the leggings since they are high waist but it fits perfect for me. I am 130lbs. Love this
4.0,"Shirt is soft to touch, and nice-looking. I particularly like the design of light-colored buttons against dark-color fabric.<br />The only problem though, is the shirt is very much made of cotton, and fur/fuzz stick like crazy (more than any other material I've seen so far). It's specially obvious when you have a dark shirt and white fur. Even now we are not around any animals, the shirt is often covered by little fuzz. If you have an animal around, you will be taking all the fur to work with you."
4.0,"Wear a DD but sometimes DDD but this is comfortable, supportive enough for casual wear and can't beat the price!<br />Plus pretty small straps, that's always a bonus!"
4.0,Good color was a little off but love them
4.0,"When I first put them on, I took a 2.5 hours drive. My legs experienced no type of discomfort. Then a week later, I put them on and took a 7.5 hours flight. And again, no discomfort whatsoever. The first time I may have had them on for about 8-10 hours before I actually remembered that I had them on. And that's because I started feeling the squeeze. But, and to be honest, I had on folded them and I noticed the cuff started digging into the skin on the back of my knee. It actually left a bit of an abrasion, which turned a bit scabby. So be careful if you decide to fold them at the top. Lastly, and getting back to the amount of time that they can/should be worn. I believe I saw somewhere in their advertisement, that the company states they can be worn for up to 18 hours? I honestly don't think so. I myself, wouldn't go pass 10 hours. But then, that's just my comfort level and opinion. Otherwise, I'm satisfied with these socks."
4.0,Runs a little big but I can make it work. Exceptional quality!
4.0,Love the band but the clasp release mechanism doesn’t stay closed
4.0,"I thought the tassles would be fun, but they actually just kind of cheapened the look.  and they didnt quite match.  sent it back.  but if you love the color, its a good value and would still recommend"
4.0,It was a gift for my sis She LOVES IT!!!
4.0,"It's really cool, adjustable, but plated. Definitely worth the money, just be cautious if you have skin reactions to plating.."
4.0,This work for what I need it for. It’s is soft and lightweight. It could be a size bigger but I work with what was available in their sizing.
4.0,Fun used them on Halloween!!
4.0,This shirt is really nice!!!
4.0,"Pants are nice with good graphics but they run a bit small.  Should be ok for sleep pants, but I would recommend going a size up."
4.0,"We buy these by the ton and give them out for Halloween instead of candy.  Kids love 'em, they stay bright longer than you'd think, and don't fall apart too easily."
4.0,"Beautiful imagery on both the front and back of this shirt. My chest is 45"" so according to the chart I ordered the XL size though normally I wear a Large. Its material is a stretchy synthetic though that fact is not mentioned in its description. So it fit but was skin tight and shiny, like you might wear during exercise. Made well with two layers, the black printed exterior and an inner white layer touching your skin. Light weight and airy, it does not provide warmth.<br />Somehow I expected a cotton t-shirt with a loose fit so it was returned. However, it would be perfect for someone who needs an exercise shirt."
4.0,Great set of belts. I believe one of them may actually be reversible. The one that has the leopard print matches a pair of dress boots purchased from Amazon as well. It's nice to have a variety of colors to wear with your jeans. HECK FIRE!!!  It's nice to even be able to FINALLY wear jeans. :) They look like they will wear well & came at a good price. Gave them 4 stars because the loop came off the print belt the first day I wore it.
4.0,"Nice dress that I bought for a college graduation ceremony. Good quality for the price, and it came packaged well. If you like to dress modestly, this is a nice option because the skirt part when down to my knees. I'm 5 foot 7 inches and bought a Medium. The dress material is thick enough to wear in cold weather, and I liked the quality of the belt. The skirt portion has a lining, so you don't need to wear a slip if you don't want to wear one. Since the body portion is made of a lace-like stitch, a light-colored bra would show through, but use a black or blue bra/tank top, and it's fine. This dress is a navy blue color, but a very dark navy blue. I'm average sized and found the underarm seam made the shoulder area slightly tight. That is my only complaint though."
4.0,Very good protection.  There is a limit of the number of notes (money) that one can store.
4.0,Nice dress up special occasion mask.
4.0,Great scarf for the money.
4.0,"It fits everything except my phone. My phone will fit w/o the case plus 2 passports, money, I. D., change and close but who just have a naked phone these days? I still give it 5 stars. I bought the yellow and love the color and seems like it will be very durable!<br /><br />Update: While going thru the airport the organizer came open twice and  I lost my debit card."
4.0,"Excellent, that's the Word"
4.0,"The lace insert on this shirt is really nice and much deeper than I expected. You will have to wear a cami underneath if you don't want your bra to show. I really like the design on this blouse and it is extremely comfortable. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is because the front is not cut wide enough for a large breasted plus size woman. I am a D cup and the fit across the bust was barely enough, but it is cut generous every where else, so if you are bigger than a D cup, I would not recommend this blouse. Otherwise, it is pretty cute."
4.0,Like pockets but they add bulk on the hips. I put change in each and that helped
4.0,"This is the second one I purchased, it’s really nice but the bra top and head band needs to be crocheted a little bit wider."
4.0,Wife loves it. Does not hold its color. Fades to nearly white.
4.0,"My son liked these boots, however, they were about a half size small for his mens size 9.5 foot. He said he liked them , but wants me to reorder a 1/2 size larger, will have to return these.  Will give additional review after they are used on AK glaciers as far as how they hold up and how warm they are."
4.0,"Very nice ,except  I have a hard time keeping them in my ear."
4.0,The only thing that could have made this too better was a fuzzy inside. Love it. Fits great. Thumb holes are great fit well.
4.0,This is such a pretty blush pink color and the cut is very flattering. I love the neckline and the slight extra fabric around the cuffs. It is on the thinner side so this is definitely a dress you'd want to wear with Spanx otherwise you're going to see all the lines of your undergarments. But it's quite lovely.
4.0,The product was exactly as advertised. Service was great. My son has high tops and they seemed to be a bit tight or small for the high tops. Maybe because the laces go up higher.
4.0,Cute shirt just that it’s a little thin material but holds up well in the wash.
4.0,Good solid case for slim or children's glasses only
4.0,"I love mine, very pretty it fits just right."
4.0,Thought it had more places for cards . But I am very satisfied with the product.
4.0,"Great look. I was not as soft as i would have liked, but perhaps great for the price."
4.0,Love this piece. The only reason not 5 stars was didn't like the wire necklace..
4.0,Pretty Elegant but a smidge tight.
4.0,"Looks good, feels good. fits good. Used for lap swimming."
4.0,This dress set was perfect for 20's day at work. I should have looked at the pictures better - only the front of the dress has fringe!  Very easy/quick dress up!
4.0,I really like the non-red hats.  They are really cute.  The red ones however are poorly made and I will probably replace them next year.  I used them to decorate the dining room chairs.
4.0,The length could be longer but over all this shirt is great. Fits snug to your body and gives your arms great definition.
4.0,The arm length was just a tad off. the arms came to my wrist so I had to keep pulling the arms down to cover my wrist but other than it fit perfectly.
4.0,"I like, not love, this top. It is comfortable and flowing and just unusual looking enough to be noticed, but not so unusual that it becomes unnerving to others.  I took away a star, because the picture looks like it has a slightly tapered waist and the product does not.  So the 2x is baggy and the 1x is<br /> form fitting. I want the illusion of a waist.  Also, the white, in reality is more gray, so it does not pop as much as I would like."
4.0,"Read these reviews. My daughter is 5, I bought the 7/8size. They are very form fitting, but fit her perfectly. Nice length.<br />The only critisism, the neckline stretches out."
4.0,"Great Color, really are London Blue.  Seem smaller than expected but I think they are around 1/2 carat each which would make the description of size accurate.  Why there is a reference to an 18&#34; chain is still a mystery to me, I didn't believe it when I read it, and I was right.  Someone should just proof read the description."
4.0,Bought a a Christmas present for my son's high school girlfriend. Nice length and pretty charm. He was pleased with it and so was she so I consider it a good buy. Can't attest to the quality in the long run but if taken care of it should last a good while.
4.0,"Nice dress, love the pockets, needs a belt so I'm giving it a 4 vs. a 5."
4.0,It’s nice but pieces of it break off so it’s not very durable
4.0,"Great top. Runs fairly large but could make a dress or tunic if purchased in your regular size- if you want it to fit as a flowy top, go a size smaller."
4.0,"I ordered the 2x and it fit true to size, I'm a size 16 US dress. I love the mesh and lining under the skirt. The length in the sleeves and skirt is perfect. I'm tall, I have long arms and legs and the skirt sits right below my knees and the sleeves fall right at my elbows. Great quality for the price but I do wish the stitching was black as opposed to white."
4.0,Chain was thinner than expected. But it's still a great tool to help get the perfect length for my necklaces.
4.0,"Very hard to walk in, but so cute."
4.0,"Looks very cool, plenty of room for cards/licenses/identification, etc.  I do wish it opened a little wider, but removing that from the equation, it's really nice.  Plus, as a die-hard Spider-Gwen fan, it's essential :-)"
4.0,"Good quality like you normally get from Under Armour. This shirt is the fitted style and not loose fit,  so you may want to size up.  This shirt does run small for the size."
4.0,Larger than Guoer brand I have purchased in the past. I have a small head/narrow face. Since it it cotton it should shrink a little after washing and drying. The caps does have a draw string with a toggle to adjust the fit. The material is light weight and I like the Terry cloth lining a lot across the forehead. Nice variety of patterns and the buttons help prevent ears from getting sore.
4.0,"I really like the style of these pants. They fit well. The fabric is a somewhat stiff canvas. Because of the stiff fabric, they don’t really move with you when you bend, so not good for work pants. That being said, they are a fun fashion pant."
4.0,I purchased this beach sun dress because I loved the color of the dress and how beautiful it looked and I wasn't disappointed. After opening the package the colors of the dress were exactly as advertised and beautiful. I usually wear a size 10-12 so I got an XL and the dress fits me perfectly. It is slightly sheer as other reviewers mentioned so I definitely recommend a slip of some sort underneath. I really like the dress and I can't wait to wear it during our vacation. I received this product at a significant discount but the written review is my honest opinion
4.0,"Good for yoga, fit not as good as the prAna tunic i just bought, but it also isn't $69. :)"
4.0,"Size ordered: S<br />Measurements: 5'2&#34; tall, 32DDD bust, size 0-2 pants, usually S/M in tops<br /><br />It's a very cute dress and looks just like the photos, however I'm giving it 4 stars because it's very see-through on the top (my bra is clearly visible), it came extremely wrinkled and took a good 10 minutes to steam out, so this dress will probably be difficult to travel with if put in a suitcase as it will most likely get horrible wrinkles, and it is really low-cut in the arm holes, so if I wear a bra it's extremely visible and if I don't, I will be showing major side boob.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased, but I definitely think this dress needs to come with a built in slip or come in a different fabric so it's not see-through."
4.0,Have received many compliments for this band
4.0,"Very cute, perfect for a little girl.  A little small for an adult, but still cute as a 2nd piercing.  They don’t have a cheese factor, so they don’t look as inexpensive as hey are."
4.0,Nice material. Bottoms run small across hips. Priced too high
4.0,"Nice socks, cute colors."
4.0,Fits great and very soft!
4.0,Fit nicely and it arrived on time
4.0,"Fit as expected.  Light weight, comfortable, but have some concerns on durability."
4.0,"I love the color of this shirt and the cute cat graphic, but it’s too short for me."
4.0,Good quality my only complaint is they didn't come with instructions. So had to figure out how to change the straps out myself
4.0,"I purchased these slippers for my husband for Christmas. He had complained for years only women could buy the &#34;soft&#34; slippers, while men were stuck with having to walk in warm sandpaper slippers. Well, I proved him wrong. Now he won't take these slippers off. If we're home for more than two seconds, these slippers are on his feet. And I have to admit, I'm a little jealous. These slippers are super soft, warm and not at all &#34;girly&#34;. The down side to them is they do catch a lot of lint (corduroy), there is no bottom protection so you can't walk outside (especially if it's wet), and I can already tell they won't last more than a year. With that said, I would be happy to pay $15 again next year to buy him another pair. In our case, the slippers did run a tad small. He wears a size 11, so I bought the 11-12. The tiptoe of the slipper was right at his toe. Though, they feel like they will stretch over time."
4.0,"Got these as a present for my husband. He likes them so much, he doesn’t want to use them."
4.0,"These sports bras are quite cute, comfortable, and fit just right! The only dislike is the removable padding... Not a fan of the odd shape and didn't like the way they feel in so I removed them/ replaced them with some of my other paddings I own from previous bras."
4.0,Ease of operation
4.0,"If you're a shorter woman, they are too long. I am 5'5&#34; and they are a touch too long for me."
4.0,work as promised
4.0,"Very light, breathable and very comfortable, love them but no firm enough if you know what I mean hence the 4 star. Otherwise, it'd be 5 stars for me."
4.0,"This is a decorative mask that can be worn over a more secure one. The material is lightweight, but the rhinestones are heavy. Handwash and lay flat or hang to dry because the rhinestones are attached with adhesive that probably can't handle machine drying heat."
4.0,Good all year round
4.0,Not as high waisted oe as long as I wanted but they are cute.
4.0,I didn't think I'd like the material but its nice when you put it on. The arms feel a little tight. I thank god I ordered an xl as it is a little snug on the shoulders. I hope it doesn't shrink or I will have to give it away or I guess I could lose weight?
4.0,Dress was beautiful but was too small. Came on time & was easily returned. I would've bought a bigger size but there wasn't enough time to receive it for my daughter's event.
4.0,"Nice colors, very bright!"
4.0,"This is a very comfortable and flattering dress! I really love it. I ordered two sizes (a small and a medium) because I wasn't sure which would fit best. They both fit though! The small is a tad bit tight, but works just fine, and the medium is a little looser but also definitely wearable. My measurements are 35-28-36 by the way. The length for both is fine, and I am 5'4&#34;. I am going with the small just because it is a little more flattering on the waist but overall I would say this runs true to size!"
4.0,"Purchased this as a gag-gift for my mother at Christmas because we are a cat family and she is sensitive to loud noises. However, she flat out said that while the gag-gift was funny, she'd never wear them. SO! She let me have them and I got her a different set of cat ears that doesn't cover her ears and I get to wear these on chilly days instead! They are super soft and comfortable."
4.0,Looks good and functional.  A bit small though
4.0,Overall this is a nice piece but it's not a dress! I am 5'6&#34; and will need to wear leggings with this because of the length. Still satisfied with the quality of material and price.
4.0,it's a pretty set with colors as advertised.  Workmanship is of good quality but it's a bit too lightweight so tends to move around a lot.
4.0,Beautiful! Changed the black necklace to a silver chain.  Black was scratchy
4.0,Very comfortable and fit perfect.
4.0,"I absolutely love these pajamas for the kids because they are really nice and very soft but my only problem was they are too small. So I'm just gonna return and up 2 sizes for each pair. If you order go up 2 sizes not just 1. Wish I would have read reviews first like I usually do but I didn't. That's ok though, easy fix."
4.0,My husband gave me this for our first Christmas after we started dating because he knows how much I love Xena. It's been around my neck for two years now. Only ordering a new one now because there's nearly no design left from wear
4.0,I read the reviews and based my size on that. However it was tighter than anticipated. But super gorgeous and good material!
4.0,I have been eying these enameled earrings from other sellers and was surprised to see this multi-pack for a great price. They are all high quality and beautiful.  I gave away two as gifts and kept some for myself. Just like others I have seen in shops for double or triple the price. SHipping was quick! Highly recommend
4.0,Very pretty. True to size and very comfortable.
4.0,"Attractive but I intended to use them with a couple convertible dresses that I ended up returning, so I returned these too."
4.0,"Longer than I thought it would be, not too bad though. Still works for what i need it to be."
4.0,Great quality and size was perfect. The coloura are Bright and fun.
4.0,Nice heavier hat.  Can be positioned in a variety of ways.
4.0,"Got it for my son's suit to prom match perfectly, shipping was more than belt that why they didnt get 5 stars."
4.0,I ordered the 12-24 month size. They are a bit big for my 18 month old but she can walk around in them just fine. They seem comfy and will be great for this winter to keep her feet warm.
4.0,"Would have given 5 stars, but runs small!<br />I have a thin ankle and you could see the stringing elastic between the beads! Please adjust the size measurements!"
4.0,"A little snug on me, size 4. But a nice dress, not too elegant but perfect for church."
4.0,Just thought maybe a  little longer.
4.0,"I purchased the regular weight sweater in November and it fits fine. I ordered the Expedition a month later and was surprised by the difference in fit.  Both sweaters are mediums.  I am 5'll"" and 175.  I do not have unusually long arms or a big upper body.  Just an average dude.  The sleeves in the Expedtion are too short by at least 3/4 of an inch.  I emailed Minus 33 regarding  the issue and they were quick to respond.  They had me do some measuring and told me that the sleeve length was right at the minimum standard  and they would address it with their supplier.  If you are like me and have an issue deciding between medium and large, in this case order the large.  I know I could return it but I will keep it and order the large for my early spring Camino Santiago walk in Spain."
4.0,"Really unusual bag that changes color with the sun.  I like it a lot until I filled it with my phone, wallet and glasses.  Then the bag continually comes open.  It doesn't hold much weight.  Sadly, I returned it."
4.0,Great and good value
4.0,It's smaller than it looks in the picture but is really pretty.
4.0,"These gloves are a little bit bulkier than I had originally expected. Also, the touchscreen compatible fingertip pads  are only on the tips of the right thumb and index fingers. The left glove has no touchscreen compatible fingertip pads. They are however pretty well insulated and do a good job of keeping my hands warm. They have been standing up to a small amount of wear and tear. In general, I would recommend these gloves, but as I mentioned, the main two drawbacks are their bulkiness, and that the touchscreen compatibility is only on the right glove, not on the left."
4.0,Wife liked!
4.0,"Beautiful dress, fits great, compliments my figure well. Always get compliments when I wear this."
4.0,The color was not right as expected but there awesome slippers 😊
4.0,Just like it said she loves it I don't think the pics did it justice and having a matching wallet was awesome well worth the money!
4.0,"I purchased this sweater in the white. The button is in an odd place. It does not button and drape as shown in the description. However, I still kept it because it is really soft and warm. I did remove the awkwardly placed button."
4.0,Bag is cute for Golden Girls fan but a bit small I should of paid my attention to the size.
4.0,So cute! I want it in every color. 😁
4.0,Looked good. I did not like the material
4.0,"Liked , the are really light and really help with the glare specialty wen we are at the ocean."
4.0,Super cute but VERY short! I'm 5'1 and this is a mini dress.
4.0,Bigger than avertised
4.0,Long enough & thick
4.0,"nice for around house, beach"
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these caftans.  The look nice and are comfortable and are true to the stated size on the description.  Given the fabric, you will need fabric softener or dryer sheets to address static.  I got them to wear at night on the boat, as they will dry quickly if washed while out cruising."
4.0,Thought they would be hard fabric 😏
4.0,"Bottoms were a little small, top fit fine. I ordered the next size up as suggested."
4.0,Good for the beach
4.0,"These go WAY higher then picture shows. If you want them above you're belly button then they're great and decent quality, but i didn't keep them because i wanted something just below belly button"
4.0,it fits fluffy
4.0,Delivered on time but a little to big.
4.0,"Product is great, but I would go one size up."
4.0,"Got this in large. I usually wear medium but I like baggy hoodies so I opted for large. I like the bagginess and looseness of it just what I was really looking for. The cloth material is soft and of medium quality. I love the color combination and true to the one displayed.<br /><br />Height: 5'4""<br />Bust: 36”<br />Waist: 31”<br />Hips: 37<br />Mid Butt: 40”"
4.0,"Clearly a 5 star material, a great value pack with the variety. Yet, one of the stockings (3rd one from the left) had a big hole on back of the thigh, in one of the legs, which I'm not sure it's part of the design or a simple mishandling. I don't want to go through the trouble of returning for just that, but 4 stars it shall be."
4.0,This product arrived in its own personal case which is awesome for storing your grillz in between use! The gold color is vibrant! This definitely comes with the necessary items to have a comfortable fit!
4.0,"I like the hat, but when it came in the packaging was to small now the brim has a wave in it."
4.0,"I read mixed reviews on this before I decided to buy... hard to figure out and whatnot. Yes, it takes a bit of getting used to but once you figure it out it really is a great layering piece. One thing to keep in mind is your frame, I am 5'10 so in order for me to wear it comfortably and achieve a good look my sleeves are more 3/4 length sleeves. This is not a pull it out of the package and wear it piece but if you are willing to invest some time (it took me about 30 minuets) to learn how to wear it... you will like this."
4.0,Nice Strap.  Hook is really nice.  The leather is lined with a stretchy material.  When you practice for a while is makes you neck sweat.  Don't like that.  Better than most neck straps.
4.0,"Nice look, quality and price"
4.0,It’s a SLIM FIT so order up a size if you have any doubt.
4.0,"Cute, comfy, light weight. I'm short 5'3&#34; and this comes to just above my ankles."
4.0,This for 29ers only
4.0,"These do block the blue light of computers and other devices, but they are a bit large for my face and heavier than I thought they would be when clipped onto my glasses. However, the large lenses would cover almost all glasses I would think."
4.0,T-shirt is very boxy. I am 6 ft and 165lbs. Material wrinkles easily. Should have ordered a medium for better fit
4.0,No problems. Seems to be of very good quality.
4.0,Fits well… it’s what I expected… top is stretchy like a bathing suit’s cute crisscross back.
4.0,"I love this bathing suit and based on reviews I ordered up in size. Unfortunately it was too big so I returned it and ordered a size smaller. I hope it fits, should be arriving today."
4.0,"This is a really nice jacket. Quick shipping. I got the WJC664, The black w/ charcoal, size, S. I'm usually a S or M, but went with the S. The reviews said it ran small, but I really think I could have used the XS. It looked like it would be more form fitting, like the picture, but definitely a bomber jacket style. I'm 5&#34;1&#34;, 107-110 lbs. measurements are, 34 25 34. I have plenty of room in the S. There's not a real hoodie inside, it's a zip out hood, with sleeves, with thumb holes. Seems like it will be warm. Sturdy zippers. Overall a nice fall jacket!"
4.0,Like the material and the style there good work pants for me only complain is there a bit baggy for me if they were a bit more fitted id buy more but other then that great product for the price
4.0,Nice slip a little snug would order size up but ok will just wear as is.
4.0,"These look so gorgeous on me! I noticed many people were staring at me when i was wearing it and i knew it was because of these amazing necklaces! (these people were strangers and i know these looks, these mean excitement and approval!)<br />I really really like them! Its very very very light, almost like a feather!!!!<br />The only things when buying those you have to be prepare to constantly adjusting them because the leaf tends to slide off and fall so it never where you want tis leaf to be. I found this very uncomfortable!<br />But if you find exact way how you want your necklace to be you can just snap in in place with pin then i think it will look fine, but unfortunately it wont be staying in place just like this, otherwise i totally like this piece of jewelry.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
4.0,This was a gft
4.0,The socks do have dry wick so you feet don't seem to sweat after a cycle class.
4.0,"Love the idea behind this but I find sometimes the fit seems to loosen after I adjusted it,no big deal still a great belt."
4.0,"I ordered two of these for two sisters on their birthday. They are cute and I think they will last awhile. Only reason for a 4 star rating as that even though I ordered from the same place, one came with a finer chain and the other came with a bigger chain. Still looks very nice!"
4.0,bought for my son fit him a little small but he was happy
4.0,"The face is slightly larger than I expected for my small wrist, but I've gotten many compliments. My complaint is that the tick of the watch is so loud. Other than that I am pleased with the watch."
4.0,"Very nice dress. Has no pockets though, which is why I bought it for my daughter. Disappointed, but overall a nice dress."
4.0,I love the look of the shoe and my daughter seems to really like wearing them.  She has a thick foot so it has been difficult to find shoes that didn’t press into the top of her foot. These were great. No pressure places after wearing them all day at daycare.  I will say the quality could be a bit better for the price.  After just two days of regular wear; short strings were poking out all over the seams.
4.0,Bueno para el precio 😄
4.0,"It’s a beautiful print on a nice sheer bodysuit that you can wear in all seasons. The fit is nice, but remember because it is sheer material you do have to be careful not to snag or run it"
4.0,This dress isn't bad. I purchased the boho color. I only have 1 problem with it. The chest is set very wide so the material kid of sits in your arm pits which is really annoying. It's a little longer than my other maxi dresses but it's not a huge issue. It would have been perfect if it weren't for the wide set chest.
4.0,Didn’t stay in place for me but very nice earrings.
4.0,"I purchased the size large first, but it was too small across the top (even after adjusting the straps), so I gave that one away and made someone very happy.. I then ordered the XL and it fits, except that each armhole has a odd small gap of extra material that I'm sure the designer thought was important..  I will have to sew up the gap and then it will fit perfectly..  I love the fabric and it's nice for the price.."
4.0,"I wanted a jean look without the skin tight fit. I have previously bought this brand/style in corduroy.<br />Based on that purchase, I got XL to have that almost pajama fit. However, to my surprise, this pant had extra fabric around the hips, and was quite low in the crotch. Because I like the style, the seaming details and the soft denim-like fabric, I will order another color except in the Large. In my opinion, this fabric is more what I would call a chambray, rather than a true pant weight denim and is perfect for our climate in the Pacific Northwest almost all year round."
4.0,Cute and jus a travel summer bag Nicely constructed
4.0,My niece loved it! Fit was great and it was a good deal for the price
4.0,"my daughter must have bought this.....i had no idea i bought one of these.  looked my my dresser, it isn't mine!!  the girl in the picture seems to make it look good!!"
4.0,"All 4 sizes that we bought are baggy, not fitted like the photos. Also, the women's have shorter sleeves than comfortable. They needed to add about an inch to the sleeves in each sleeve.<br />Purchased 5T, 6T, men's medium, women's small and medium."
4.0,"This costume is great quality and fits well. Unfortunately it was too plain for the Bridgeton event that I wanted to wear it at, so I returned it."
4.0,"According to the size chart, the small should have fit me. Nope! Offered it to my daughter, but she hated the fabric, said it felt scratchy on her skin. Ended up giving it to a friend who loves it. Fits her perfectly, and she got lots of compliments at an art show she was running. Cute dress, sort of a 40s vibe, which is why I wanted it. Will not bother to reorder in a bigger size, but happy it found a good home."
4.0,Hard to beat these for the price if you want real wool.
4.0,"Very bendy. Just gonna throw that out there. Other than that, you get tons of them to just pop one on if you lose it in the bathroom at a party so you can do a finger sniff of coke. Basically, these aren't gonna last you that long."
4.0,The lace is a little itchy. But it is a very cute top.
4.0,Not super slouchy like I was hoping for but definitely good warm hats for winter.
4.0,Just a little to wide foe me.
4.0,"These sandals seem sturdy and fell like the original Adidas adillete. The best part is they were 1/4 the price. I like the logo. I would give 5 stars, but waiting to eee if they last as long as the Adidas"
4.0,Runs half size small
4.0,Thick ring very nice.
4.0,"For the price these are great! My only reservation is that the stud is too long. It isnt flush with my skin on the inside of the nose, it pokes into the other side and hurts a little. But this only happens if someone hit it or you are kissing etc. This will affect the way it stays in too, it has fallen out a lot bc of it. BUT that is why you have over 60 of them. So far the diamonds havent come out yet, which i have had happened the day after i had bought a ring (not these) But I would reccommend."
4.0,"I got the clear round happy face, the design is super and I really like them. They are lightweight which is fine, but the clear plastic part of the earring is too cheap and covered in scratches. Blending into my hair you can’t tell but they would be even cooler if the materials were better."
4.0,"I ordered a large, my usual size but it is a bit snug."
4.0,Had to purchase larger size to accommodate waist. True size was too revealing at waist.
4.0,Cute dress but runs a little small.  It still fit but is probably only to be worn as a clubbing dress as the slit is really high.
4.0,As described. But if you have a bunch of keys I'd go with a large 3 inch key ring instead. It works but it's like a big glob of keys. Lol
4.0,"These are super waist small.  I'm a size 0, xxxs, 84 lbs. The small was too tight on my waist."
4.0,"These are cheapish pants. They are tight fitting (supposed to be). They are a nice pattern made os some kind of synthetic material. if you have a yoga bum, and like boot legged pants, then you'll likely like these. I do not have a yoga bum, but I am keeping them and living in hope."
4.0,Received ahead  of estimated delivery date. Well made and great support
4.0,Works well so far.... Bit warmer than expected for driving gloves
4.0,These shoes are super cute but they do not give all day support at my age! But for a five hour party or event they are perfect and fun.
4.0,fit is smaller than anticipated
4.0,"after I go these, I quickly realized I hated the ear holes (my own personal opinion)  so I just flip the over where the ear holes are at the bottom. they are super comfortable and just the right length, some other brands are way to long.  the one interesting feature is they all fit slightly different. the light Grey tends to be the loosest fit and the dark blue fits more snug; none are uncomfortable, just slightly different fit."
4.0,Cute. Good quality. Sleeves are too short. Bottoms are SUPER SHORT!<br />A word of warning... I prefer my tops baggy for sleeping. Normally wear a medium and ordered a large...top is comfy but shorts are too big. Unable to alter as waistband elastic is sewn in. Keep that in mind.
4.0,Great for a Woodstock costume party
4.0,Look at the size chart. I wear an XL or even L top. I got the 2XL and it is almost smaller than I like. The exception are the sleeves. I have to turn them back 3 inches and I have long arms. That being said it is a nice soft shirt and I like The Kindness print.  It is a bit shorter than I like in length but I will enjoy wearing it. I do hope no shrinking when washed or it will not fit. Will wash in cold water and hang to dry
4.0,"Had to get it wet and reshape it, will probably also be removing the band to replace it with my own."
4.0,"This top is cute, but the size is smaller than other Allegra tops, I would purchase one size up."
4.0,The cages are beautiful I was going to place pearls in them but some of the cages are too small and the loops where a chain needs to go through are too small. You can't fit a chain through all the loops so some can't be used.
4.0,"True to size, no need to order up unless you need extra space in the chest area :) Good, heavy cotton material."
4.0,"Nice quality, but way too large for everyday use."
4.0,Great sexy look!  Perfect for summer.
4.0,"I do like the size etc, however the color is much lighter than the pic. I was a little disappointed with that. Otherwise, I like it."
4.0,Bought this for a Sonic Costume. Perfect size and nice weight. It's a bit lighter than pictured more translucent pale green than bright green.
4.0,I am happy with this purchase. I like that the belt has just enough bling! My waist is 27” and my hips are 36”. I can wear this at my waist or on my hips - there are plenty of holes. I also like that there’s an extra loop that is not attached so you can slide it as needed if there is an extra “tail.” The quality looks pretty good and there is no smell or any kind. It is certainly thin enough to fit within nearly all belt loops.
4.0,"Great looking, fit well.  Could be used as a dress, or with a pair of black leggings."
4.0,"These are basically ThinOptics without the flimsy and uncomfortable nose pads. Also a much better value. I have tried all the brands of stick-to-your-phone reading glasses, and IMO these are the best."
4.0,"Great chain, didn't fade . Worth the price"
4.0,This was such an awesome buy. Wore on a family trip with Capri leggings. Very soft material and comfortable.
4.0,The quality is very good. It is not a body fit. But great to wear for a walk or workout.
4.0,"These are pretty and well made, but be aware that they really are &#34;bling.&#34;  These babies are large and loud.  Lovely for special events, but I would not wear them every day."
4.0,These leggings are very soft and really comfortable! The material is silky smooth and very high quality. You can squat and bend and stretch and the fabric moves with you without becoming see through. I'm 5 feet tall and these leggings sit high on my waist and fit perfectly at the ankle. I ordered the xs and it fits true to size. I took off one star because one of the side effects of having such incredibly soft material is that this offers no compression at all. If you have any bulge in your stomach area this will show and if you're looking for leggings that lift up your butt this isn't it either. These are great for working out and cute enough to just wear out while running errands.
4.0,"This is a beautiful top...... I've ordered items from the Allegra K brand before and they normally run true to size.  I normally wear an XL, so I ordered an XL and it was quite a bit bigger on me than I'd expected.  I should have at least gotten a large.  The top itself, is of great quality and super cute style."
4.0,"I personally am not a huge fan of the material on this, but my husband did not seem to mind.  I really like the color and the fit on him.  He says it is breathable and comfortable so that it is a win.  This can also be worn with jeans or you can dress it up a little with some khaki or black pants."
4.0,"Heavy, but beautiful."
4.0,Great length but very huge style
4.0,It's really pretty and fits well. A little higher the stone compared to the photo.
4.0,"Well made but to thick for my wallet, I cut out a few pages"
4.0,"Quality was as expected. The pieces come folded, so there's a little bit of a crease, but it doesn't affect the ability to wear"
4.0,"Good product,  Definitely needed for working out! Works great but not so durable, it does provide comfort but slowly starts to peak inside. 2 months in and it's failing apart !"
4.0,"Soft,comfortable, good fit."
4.0,"I put fit as expected, but the pants did not have as much room as I had hoped.  I wanted them for golf in colder weather and they are nice and warm, yet not real bulky.  The pants did arrive with a little split in one of the seams, but I was able to fix it easily."
4.0,Awesome look and feel as well as price. Time will only tell about durability but it seems very well made. I’m not giving it 5 stars because I had to wash right out of the package as it was very dirty. You could see the brown stains where the watch would sit.
4.0,They are definitely not sweat proof as you can see; this was after running four miles. They are super comfortable and they stay in place throughout the whole run even with my heavy phone in the hip pocket. They are a great workout short but maybe buy a darker color if you’re concerned about the sweating!
4.0,Nice quality runs large. Would buy again
4.0,really cute on!
4.0,It's a beautiful shirt.  I just wish it were longer.  Plus sizes need to be longer.
4.0,"Waistband is very forgiving, had next to no compression. The fabric is very stretchy and surprisingly soft! The stretchy softness makes them a smidge less flattering since they offer no compression but they’re more flattering on my bum. This also makes them more comfortable. The pink is WAY more subtle than it looks in the advertised pictures but I’m okay with it since the booty contour isn’t my favorite feature. The waistband could afford to be a bit tighter on me but it’s not as bad as A LOT of the leggings I’ve tried. They’re also really high waisted! Which is a huge pro for me! I’m seriously surprised by how much I like these leggings. I suspect they’re not totally squat proof but it’s tough to tell for sure in the lighting in my place.<br /><br />Side note these are obviously a knock off of the Gymshark amplify seamless."
4.0,"For the most part, the fit is good, the the bottom hem of the blouse tappers in at the edges, which is pretty strange. I had to have my tailor let that part out a bit. The rest of the blouse fit fine."
4.0,"Nice glasses. They look good and the polarized lens is a real plus. There is no comparison between a polarized and non polarized lens. They seem well made too and the enclosed case, cord, and cloth really round out the deal. Very happy."
4.0,"Arrived in 2 days, as advertised!  The fabric is super soft and fits true to size."
4.0,Ordered a large but this item runs small. Good quality though.
4.0,"Coat is a little too big. I am 5'9"" 160lbs and I orders a large thinking it would be approx my size. I think a medium would have fit better. Otherwise the coat is beautiful, classic and just what I needed for the out door wedding  I attended."
4.0,Item was darker in color than pictured. Still a very nice item.
4.0,Overall this was a nice outfit. The main issie was quality. The material is decent but not the best. It worked for what Ibused it for but wouldnt ve good for a lot of use.
4.0,This cuff arrived within 7 days of purchase in a small black drawstring bag. It is an attractive piece with character. It does not have much flexibility and fits snug around a Mens 8 1/2 inch wrist.
4.0,"absolutely love this dress, style, length and pockets. Only problem i had was the material was thin and see through. I don't want to worry about people seeing through my dress in daylight. so i'm returning dress back. may need to get a darker color."
4.0,"I found a pair of workout capris from this brand at Marshalls, and they've become my absolute favorite to work out in: Comfortable fabric that's actually opaque, high waist WITH a drawstring, and the perfect length for my 5'3&#34; frame. I bought those in a size Medium, and they fit perfectly (145#, 30in waist, thick thighs/legs, longer torso, pretty straight up-and-down). When I saw these on Amazon, I purchased them immediately. As soon as they were delivered, I tried them on and wore them to that night's workout. The pros: The material is super comfy and isn't see-through at all. The inseam was great and didn't make my thick legs look like stumps. The cons: I ordered my normal size Medium, and while they fit comfortably in the legs/thighs, they are too large in the waist. I was pulling them up constantly during my HIIT class, which instantly made me forgot their positives. They do have a high-ish rise, but I would have preferred at least an inch higher (wouldn't solve them being too big, but it's a start). I suppose I could try them in a smaller size, but I'd risk having the legs be too tight and the rise would still be an issue. I can see why so many people like them, but my search continues..."
4.0,Liked the colors. Would have liked a heavier material and more length. Good for the prize...
4.0,"Item Arrived In Excellent Condition Through Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Purchased In Small.<br />Jacket Has Great Color To It, As Shown.<br />I Am 5'9"", 135lbs<br />Jacket Somewhat Tight At The Chest With The Zipper Up.<br />Sleeves Are Good In Length (As I Have Long Arms), However Very Lose At The Wrist.<br />Materials Feel Like It Can Snag Very Easily.<br />I Wear It For Casual Fridays At Work.<br />Not Meant To Keep Warm, But Will Work Great In During The Summer Weather To Fall Transition.<br /><br />Cannot Say I Would Recommend, As The Small Size Depending On Your Body Body Type Will Fit Differently.<br />If You Are 5'9"" And Built I Do Not Recommend, Meant More For A Slim Profile."
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, lost one crystal within the first week but this was worn 24/7 for several months with no other issues."
4.0,"This product is just as pictured.  You get what you pay for, very basic set for a quick choice of cuff links"
4.0,It fits well<br /><br />I like it👍🏾
4.0,"I bought this belt out of nostalgia. When I was a kid, my entire family would watch Saturday morning wrestling. Harley Race, Ric Flair, and the American Dream, Dusty Rhodes all wrestled for this belt. Mostly everything is spot on. But the flags of Mexico and Japan are not level/straight. Minus 1 star. Truth be told, this was bought STRICTLY for the fond memories of the family all together back in the day. Brings a smile to my face when I see it, despite the mentioned flaws. Also, it doesn't come with a carrying case or bag, but it doesn't say that it does. This is the only strap I've ever wanted because of the memories. I would NEVER buy another wrestling belt of any kind. I am by no means a collector who fantasizes they are an actual wrestling champion.  Haven't been a fan or watched since the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin days."
4.0,The bra top is kinda flimsy so if you have big boobs unless they’re fake I wouldn’t bother with the top. But I loved the bottoms and the headband
4.0,Accessory - like the cuff with a little movement
4.0,Color isn’t as nice as pictured.
4.0,"VERY pretty,well made and easy to put on and off. I think the wire might be a bit a bit delicate so I am careful when putting them in  and taking them off. They are small enough to look real but big enough to be seen and I have had many compliments on them.I  purchased another pair slightly bigger with a different design and they are gorgeous. The company is great and answers any questions you might have about how to wear them and put them in."
4.0,"They were very cute but too small, I ended up returning them. They are two separate kinds of material and one stretched and the other didn't."
4.0,"I like the four out of the six pieces I got. The CZ and ball horseshoe, U-shaped retainer, and pave CZ style rings are my favorite. So far, they haven't worn out and you can tell they are actually stainless steel. They haven't turned green or anything. My favorite is the U-shaped style because it's so easy to slide in and out. I'm not a fan of the clicker ring because it's so hard to get open and closed and hurts my nose trying to get it to click open. The seamless ring is okay but I always end up chipping my nails up trying to twist it, so I avoid it. Overall, they're great piercings for the price."
4.0,Great product and quality! My son loves it. True to size!
4.0,"The wsy it looks in the picture is really misleading in terms of color. It looks a super shiny gold in the pictures, I believe because of special lights, while the color with normal light is not shiny at all.<br />However, the cufflink itself is great and if you have no issue with the shiny gold, you'll totally like it."
4.0,These are what u see.  Cute. Get them if this what u seek
4.0,Material is nice. Color is a wee bit different but I’m sure would fade. It’s too small. I’m 5’9” 135 size A/ B with bra and the arms/chest were too tight and I could barely get it over my head. Was afraid it was gonna rip. I will be returning as I’m sure after I wash it will even more snug.
4.0,I love the color. It has a roomy bust which is more flattering on me. Sleeves are a bit long and definitely need to be pushed or rolled up as shown on the picture. It wrinkles easily if not removed promptly from the dryer. Overall ok but probably will not order any other colors.
4.0,"I really, really like the Cyanstyle hoodie.  It is listed as a hoodie sweater but it is a pullover hoodie.  I like the black/grey combination, which matches with most jeans or with black leggings.  The material is very soft and comfortable.  It did not shrink or pill in the wash.  P hung it to dry as I do with most shirts so I do not know how it would hold up in the dryer.  I took one star away because I cannot wear it!  I am usually a size medium in tops so ordered this in a medium.  I cannot even pull it over my head.  I wish I had gotten a large or even an XL as I like hoodies to be on the looser side.  I only took away one star because besides the size, the hoodie is so nice!"
4.0,"After reading the other reviews before purchasing, I ordered up 2 sizes and it fits perfect.  This is a cute swimsuit for the price!"
4.0,"If you are a US Soccer Fan you should want to own this dvd. It shows all the goals from the WC 2006. The goals by Czech vs USA were shown, the goals by Italy and the US were shown, and Clint Dempsey's goal vs. Ghana were shown too including some slow motion/replay.<br /> This dvd features all the other teams and groups, of course. Also featured are the top 10 goals and top 10 saves in this tournament. The commentating is good.<br /> The only thing I didn't like about it is that you have to fast forward through all the groups in alphabetical order in order to get to a specific group. The links to specific group play didn't work.<br /> For soccer fans of all nations, I would recommend this video. Enjoy."
4.0,"My earlier review is the same. The jacket is what I wanted, but the thin plastic zipper might eventually be a problem. The Amazon warning regarding the size is correct. The jacket runs quite small. Make sure you use the measurement table, not your usual S/M/L/XL choice. There is a price on the tag of “1,099” with the Chinese currency symbol. So the price marked on the windbreaker is 1099 Chinese Yuan, or about $170 US."
4.0,"It’s what you would expect for the price. Not super high-quality, but I’m not going to wear very often. The waistband didn’t lay flat, but overall a good product."
4.0,the settings took awhile to figure out but did what there made for
4.0,"They are very cute knee straps and soft , feel very comfortable. The drawback is that it keen on falling offf the knees when crawling."
4.0,"It somewhere as expected. The only issue I had was the fact that I’m a 36 C-D  depending on where I shop. The way the stress is made the lines under the breast area do not look quite right if you are top-heavy. I am 5 foot 3 1/2 inches and it went all the way to the floor, With a  very small heeled sandal,  The length is perfect. It would also work with someone taller who doesn’t mind showing some leg, mine is this figure from an accident so I like hiding mine. All that aside I received many complements, it’s a very beautiful dress. It was also very light which was good because I wore it a very hot day."
4.0,"Well made and nice looking, but run incredibly small!  Easily 2 sizes too small."
4.0,I thought it was so cute and got it as a Xmas gift for my daughter. Unfortunately she got a different one from in- laws that she liked better so I sadly must return this darling purse ☹️
4.0,"Not the best quality fabric (pills easily), but for a holiday lark and casual purpose, it's well worth the price. Soft and comfortable and I love having roomy pockets.  Would definitely consider a non-holiday pattern for a casual beach coverup or run-around dress."
4.0,nice but I wish it was a bit more detailed.
4.0,"The shirt is made of nice flowy material.  Looks nice.  Fit is a little snug.  I am a size 18/20 and the XL barely fits me, but will work fine with an underbust corset."
4.0,"Great fabric, nice combined cotton/linen texture with a touch of spandex stretch, front pockets are lined in light nylon... all very comfortable, breathable in the heat and dry quickly. Back pocket is kinda small, agreed.<br /><br />The fit is somewhat off, but if you prefer longer shorts or are willing to hem them, it's totally worth it to go up a size and get a deal on comfy shorts which strike a nice balance between classy and casual thanks to the look of the fabric and understated sewn in cuff combined with elastic waistband and drawstring. I normally wear 32x30 pants and found the small to be the best fit. Crotch fits fine, however, the leg lands just at the top of my kneecap, or more where shorts with 11&#34; inseam would land on me. I don't prefer this and will have them hemmed to around 8 or 9&#34; inseam, but I'm happy with the value and they're certainly wearable as is."
4.0,This thing looks so tiny on my wrist so I gave it to my sister.
4.0,"Need to be glued, but work great."
4.0,"It is a nice costume, but was a little smaller than expected."
4.0,"These are really tiny. If that is what you want, then these are great.  I had to use pliers to bend the curve a bit to accommodate my nose. They look like a piece of glitter on your nose."
4.0,"This shirt is so cute. Great quality and so soft. The design is screen printing, not an iron on so it will last longer. I have gotten so many compliments on it."
4.0,They are not super dark.
4.0,I LOVE this suit but it is a tad small. I cant wear it without worring about a nip slip which sucks. It was a one size fits all with a warning that it was a bit small so its not like I was not warned. I am 5'2&#34; 145lb with dds so big boob girls be cautious.
4.0,This white band replaced my original Apple sport band and it fit perfectly. The only negative thing is it doesn't stay as clean as the Apple brand. Thus only 4 stars. It's a good replacement for the money!<br /><br />Edit-Still going strong. It does stay as clean as the Apple one. It does stretch out somewhat but so did the Apple band. Will buy again!
4.0,"I think because it was too stiff at first, I wasn't crazy about it. But now that I've worn it more, I like it more. It's a cute blouse."
4.0,"Very cute shoes and are better for regular wear than your typical dress-up shoes. My pink-loving daughter adores them and has been wearing them every day to school. They’ve held up better than I thought they would so far, and she hasn’t complained about any spots where they pinch or rub. The rubber soles on the bottom are great - not slippery like so many dressy shoes.<br /><br />The only drawback of these shoes is I actually bought two pairs - one in a size 1 and one in a size 12.5, for both my daughters. They turned out to both be European size 32, so the two pairs of shoes are exactly the same size. The kids don’t seem to mind, though, as one kid prefers her shoes a little large and one prefers hers a little small. 🤷‍♀️"
4.0,Looks a little big but super cute
4.0,This is a nice product but I wish it was longer to accommodate larger bra sizes/longer torsos.
4.0,"I went based off the busy measurement and it fits great. It’s very flattering over the stomach area, which was my concern. I LOVE the embroidery and the look of it. The only thing that takes it down a star is that the embroidery is an appliqué and small parts of the edges aren’t totally tracked down. There are a few little wisps of loose threads, but I have two shirts like this and, so far, it’s obly a minor inconvenience."
4.0,Adorable bottoms. Top is really tight yet big at the same time! I would go with black!
4.0,Quality Item
4.0,These are sweet.
4.0,"Was to small for me, so I passed it on to another family member with a much smaller head. The material is thin, see through and very comfortable for a small teenager or tiny adult but to small for average size adult; as it felt like I was being smothered on me."
4.0,Did not fit a size 9 foot. The socks were constricting
4.0,These were good for us to have in Vietnam. If it over soaks the gel starts squeezing out from the seams.
4.0,"My 3 year old loves them.  Only thing is i wish i knew how to clean the material, especially after a muddy puddle festival. None the less, these are great."
4.0,"Not bad, for the price you get what you expect. Construction was fairly solid bu the materials on the metallic looking part of the arms is really cheap plastic that is already chipping a little. Overall though, solid pair of sunglasses on a budget."
4.0,"I received these earrings very quickly. They are lightweight and cute on. Really, for the price these inexpensive earrings cannot be beat. Not the highest of quality but they look nice."
4.0,Is pretty and the color is just like you see In the pictures . But it is really long and big it all the pends what you wanet for.
4.0,"I ordered these in Grey and the style and color were exactly what I was expecting -- the color is a nice dark grey, bordering on charcoal. The fabric was even better than I expected, as it's nice and thick. I wore these while out and about on a high-40s morning with boots, a thin cashmere sweater and scarf and stayed very comfortable.<br /><br />I knocked one star off because of fit. I'm 5'5&#34;, typically a size 12, and an &#34;apple&#34; shape (thicker waist, and proportionally thinner legs) and the US-Large was definitely a bit on the big side for me. The fit is okay, they're just not as form-fitting through the legs as I like. In most leggings I wear a large, and given the many reviews here that these were sized small, I figured I'd be safe with the sizing. But, if I order another pair of these, I'll be sizing down to the US-Medium."
4.0,Ive been wearing the earring for about a month now. I haven't lost any of the stones and i never take it out. It fits nicely into the curve of my ear and it irritates my new piercing less than the jewelry i got when i was pierced. So i love it other than the only issue being the metal that holds the stones turns my skin green. The metal that goes through my skin though doesn't seem to be irritating.
4.0,"If you’re kid plays rough, get a little better of a shoes. My son somehow has part of the rubber missing on the toe already."
4.0,Delivery took a little while but I am satisfied with the item. I'm happy it came with two instead of just one.
4.0,The dress is lovely and it fits great!  I am giving 4 stars because the bow overpowers it a bit. I wish the bow was removable.
4.0,"At first I wasn't sure how I felt about it, but then I tried them on a second time and after styling it with a nice shirt, I decided I liked it after all. I ordered an L based on other people's reviews (I am 5'4&#34; and about 135 lbs - it hits me just below the ankle). It fits just right at the waist and loosely in the legs like the photo above which is how I like it. I also love the color (the grey blue) which I feel is more original compared to the other colors. It's cute!"
4.0,"This belt seems rather decent. However, they place a removable plastic tab in the buckle area that is very difficult to remove! I don’t know what the purpose of it is, but someone should seriously reconsider its necessity. Good luck removing it."
4.0,It is darker then the picure . But overall it is nice
4.0,A bit lightweight but well made and good price. Cool color ! Red zipper matches + looks great. Extra little phone pocket is nice !
4.0,Looks good but not sure how to attach my watch face. Did I miss if there was a instruction pamphlet?
4.0,"The pendant is nice, but the chain seems cheap."
4.0,"For my Wife, so I do not wear them...she likes them especially being, well now the end of winter"
4.0,bought for my daughter she loved them
4.0,Nice quality<br />Nice colors
4.0,shoulders are extra wide
4.0,"Looks really nice! The length is perfect. Only down side is the clamp feels a little off, almost as if it's stiff. I got it open with care but I'll still have to be cautious. Over all it looks great!"
4.0,Love this shirt! Super comfortable
4.0,Item arrived promptly and as described.  Thank you.
4.0,nice jeans. fit is very skinny and doesn't work for girls.  If you're a guy that likes skinny jeans these would work.
4.0,Exactly as described. But it's a pain to untangle.
4.0,"The ankle strap was too big so had to poke another hole in it. Additionally, my daughter scratched her ankle taking them off the first time. The latch hook took some getting used to."
4.0,We wanted an inexpensive pair of earmuffs for our grandson for the drag races and other loud events...these are perfect...he's 2 and they have plenty of room to extend...and in a pinch could be used by an adult as long as their head isn't too big....LOL.  We really like them for the rpice.
4.0,"The necklace looks fine. It does not look as crystal clear as in the picture, but it still looks nice when I wear it."
4.0,Good cape for Halloween.  It’s on the thinner side.  Not super big.  Does not go around whole body.  Just around shoulders.
4.0,Fits good. Looks great. My eye lids rub the mask and make it a bit uncomfortable.
4.0,Dress is gorgeous but the size was a little smaller than I expected.
4.0,Love the fit of this dress but the material wrinkles so easily and it’s difficult to iron. Overall like the dress
4.0,Love this dress. Only issue I had was boob area coming up every now and then and having to pull it back down in place.
4.0,shiny like a mobster's tie<br />but otherwise perfect
4.0,Dress is gorgeous that’s why I gave it 4 stars. I read the reviews and went a size higher however if you are big cheated as I go 3 size higher. I wear XL 38DD I ordered a XXL but the neckline was too tight. Have to return it.
4.0,"I bought these for my son and his wife for a Christmas present so I haven't given them to them yet.  I am sure that they will like them very much.  We have some but they are not your brand, and they make packing so much easier.  The ones I bought from you look slightly smaller than the ones I have.  I am anxious to hear from my son and his wife how they work for them on their next vacation."
4.0,They are very nice. I gave them away they didn't look right on me. It was what I expected to receive.
4.0,"This dress is cute, cute, cute but the size runs quite small. I had to return due to this. Keep that in mind when ordering and you'll be fine.The quality seems to be good for the price."
4.0,I really like the product
4.0,Really helps night driving
4.0,"For the price, can't beat it.  2 extra rings would make it even better."
4.0,"I am very impressed with the quality of this bathing suit.  The material is thick and it is all well made. I would order a size up if you want it to fit. I wear medium in everything so ordered that and it is a bit tight. I will still where it but it is not as comfortable as it can be. The bottom is cute small as well so keep that in mind. I wish that it has more coverage. I really like it though and am thinking of getting another one in another color. It was comfortable and covered what I wanted covered. It is super cute and I cant wait to where it at the pool.<br /><br />I got this Roswear Women's Lined Up Double Up Tankini with Triangle Swimsuit at a discount for my testing, evaluation & honest, unbiased review. The fact that I got them at a discount has not influenced or impacted my judgment of this product. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product."
4.0,Very comfort. Good arm holes. I bought 2 and live them both
4.0,"I ordered six of these for my wedding, and they arrived way ahead of schedule! They turned out to be a darker red than they looked in the picture (more like a wine-red than a Christmas-red) but they will still work. I had some concerns about them falling apart, like some of the other reviews have mentioned, but my fiance tried one of the bow ties on and it seemed to be made well enough to hold up for at least the one night the we need them. Just in case, we will have someone on hand to fix them if they do snap! The suspenders are nice too, they also seem to be made well. It's obvious that the bow ties are not of the highest quality, but for the price I think they are well worth it."
4.0,Got these for my nephew. He absolutely LOVES his boots! He wore them everyday anywhere. They only lasted a year maybe? But he still loves wearing them.
4.0,This is a nice size tote for a overnight or weekend getaway. It is very sturdy. Love the purple color. I will be buying another one for my friend.
4.0,Lovely nice stone small looks nice on endless bracelet
4.0,"I didn't notice it in the product picture, but they sew the dress upside down for this print of fabric so all of the sloths are standing on top of branches rather than hanging. Still a cute dress.<br /><br />Update 6/19/18 - I ended up tearing my first dress so I ordered a replacement and this one the print was facing the correct direction!"
4.0,"cute, but one of the backs was deformed so not usable. Luckily as a multipack I just borrowed one of the other backs."
4.0,"warm & comfy, hold up well to laundering.  My only complaint is that the crew neck sometimes creeps up a bit too much on the throat, but I still love them."
4.0,Pretty shirt but material has very little stretch to it and is see through. Had to wear a tank top underneath.
4.0,"These earrings are so cute! They're way bigger than I had thought they would be (they cover my entire ear lobes and I have relatively average-sized ears) but that's okay. However, I would say that if you have sensitive ears, DON'T BUY THEM. I have really sensitive ears and they started to itch within seconds of having them on. But if you don't have this problem, they're super cute and a good buy :)"
4.0,Super cute. I bought them as a gift for my boyfriend. But they were too small for him. Now they are mine
4.0,"I will start with , I love the print ! The material is little thinner than typical sweat shirt Wich I like . What I am disappointed in - I purchased a size up to large so that it would definitely be over the shoulder as in the discripton. Going a size up didn't help at all and fits smaller than a large does normally and the collar is no where near over the shoulder . It's a pretty print and have gotten compliments on it ."
4.0,"Nice, Light, Solid.<br />I was worried about the ring &#34;opening&#34; up from adding keys, since I've seen that in reviews for similar products.<br />It did slightly happen to one after adding and removing keys several times, still usable, but I had 5 and only needed 2 so I switched to a different one.  I'm still figuring out exactly how I want my keys :)<br />They look really good."
4.0,"5'7 180 not to tight which I like, a bit long but overall good fit."
4.0,The shirt is as expected. However it is not a true red. (See picture) it’s more of a watermelon. Which is not a huge deal to me I’ll still wear it … but would be to some— Especially since it’s a Christmas themed shirt.
4.0,"The 2X large runs to small. It fits, but a bit to tight."
4.0,I really liked this bathing suit but had to return and get a smaller size. Usually I am bigger on the bottom than the top so it is difficult to find one pieces but I wish I would have just gone with the smaller size because the material is stretchy enough and fit perfectly in the right size. I am a 6-8 and ended up with a medium.
4.0,"This is actually my wedding band. I know it's cheap, but we couldn't really afford a 3000$ ring at the time and that does a great job. Looks good, and after more then a year, still intact. I never take it off, and no scratches yet on it! It just needs to be cleaned sometimes to keep it shiny."
4.0,Like the style and fit but a little snug
4.0,"Very nice, soft, comfortable hat. Fits very well and looks good. My girlfriend really likes it and wears it all the time."
4.0,I learned the hard way to order this item 1 size larger.  The first pair did not fit as well as the second pair which is 1 size larger.  These shoes are comfortable and feel like you are wearing slippers!
4.0,gave as a gift she loved it
4.0,Shoe fits great.  Feels great for hiking.  The only real is the laces. It breaks the rubber holding them to easily and then you're kinda stuck with it that way.
4.0,"The pom fell off, but other than that it's perfect."
4.0,Nice fabric. Got lots of compliments.
4.0,bought this for my girlfriend on holloween the it was a hit only thing I think they could fix are the gloves the fingers are way too long and some of the stitching around the skirt looks akward other than that it worked well for the cheap price.
4.0,"I liked it a lot, but it doesn't lock perfectly and it opens sometimes"
4.0,These stretch bracelets are very trendy. They are not connected so you can mix and match with other jewelry. Super fast shipping and great packaging. Only complaint is that the gold bar bracelet is a little rough on the edges and ended up snagging a sweater I wore quite badly. But other than that I am very happy with the purchase!
4.0,"I bought this swim top in guava in size 12 based on reading a review that said her belly showed and my tummy is usually not tan, so I don't want that.  Normally I would wear a 10.  The top arrived promptly, nicely packaged by the seller, and I wasn't blown away when I tried it on.  It's very baggy on me and very long!  And the other thing is where the bra top shows at the top, the white lining shows just a bit.  I wondered if all of the issues were due to buying a size too big.  But I can tie the straps a little tighter and make it work.  Also for the price being over $100 I was surprised at how flimsy for lack of a better word the top is.  The fabric is very thin, and it's just cut instead of hemmed.  I wonder if it will hold up?  It seems like it might fray.  But it is flattering as far as covering up tummy imperfections.  I decided to keep it and order another top in size 10 since I leave for a beach trip and didn't want to risk not exchanging it and then wishing I had kept the first one with no time to exchange again.  So I ordered this one in Emerald in case I decide to keep both.  The 10 definitely fits me better, so I would not go up a size.  And on the Emerald top the lining did not show through.  The draping on the tops aren't as defined and pretty as it is in the photo, maybe I can work with it when it's lying flat to try.  I am happy to have the top though, I wanted something easy to wear because we will be doing a very active excursion on our vacation with zip lining, giant slides, hiking, etc. and we will be running all over the place for the whole day, so I think this will work well.  I am giving the tops 4 stars, I went back and forth between 3 and 4, but because in the right size it is flattering I am sticking with the 4 and I will update my review if I have more info once I wear the tops on vaca.  Also the colors are both really pretty."
4.0,"Love the color and size of the wallet. Everything fits perfectly. Was a little concerned with how the wallet closes, but the strap is more secure than it looks on the picture."
4.0,"Just ordered, so can't comment on durability, but these socks will definitely fit a size 13 foot. Source: My foot is a size 13."
4.0,"I wear a 8 in USA pants and I got these in a size large. Fit is comfy just have to line the back pockets up with where they should be, LOL."
4.0,Length was good but it's big in the waist area. Cute overall.
4.0,I usually wear a large … I ordered a XL due to reading other reviews… VERY glad I did. It fits perfectly. A large would have been way too small for me.
4.0,"I love my necklace and bracelet! This was a gift from my husband, I could not be happier."
4.0,"These are cute, but they run extremely small! They ended up not fitting at all, and I even bought a bigger size. They are nicely made, though"
4.0,"Love the material, perfect work pants. My mistake was I put them in the dryer after washing and they shrunk.. don’t do that. haha they didn’t fade color though! Love the waist band! Wish they had pockets.... other than that definitely my go to work pants."
4.0,I carry it everywhere and card fits best. I always wanted it for a long time and got a great deal
4.0,Buenas franelas buen material pero son mas  pequeñas de lo que imaginaba.
4.0,"I really like this shrug, though it does run up in the back A LOT :/ Order a bigger size if you are considering this purchase!"
4.0,"Cute print, not adjustable straps, def on the short side if you are 5’9” like me, need to wear shorts or something under. Not see through"
4.0,pretty bichin
4.0,Looks good and it's a nice keychain. Doesn't look cheap. Only downside is the slightly sharp points for keeping in your pocket and the length/weight makes it swing and hit the car a little as you drive.
4.0,The product seemed very nice but I believe the sizing are for juniors misses. I wear size 12 pants I purchased these things in XL...way to small.
4.0,"I never knew there were Nylon underwear for men! I actually thought the nylon fabric would not breath, but I was completely wrong about that. Once I slipped these on; I found they were smooth, cool and comfortable. As a guy, I can sweat quite a lot when I'm outside feeding the animals or working in the garden. Usually I wear cotton underwear which is fine; but they tend to get a little damp and sweaty when I'm active and working in the heat of day. I didn't think there was a way around that. Now with these nylon briefs, I don't notice as much heat build up, or dampness from sweat. They're comfortable, breathable, and look good too. It takes some time getting used to the sizing. For what it's worth, I generally wear a Large in just about ALL underwear. Occasionally I'll even wear XL. When I ordered these nylon briefs, I had to go down to a SMALL! That was the only way to get a decent contoured fit. When wearing briefs, I don't want them sagging and bagging all over the place. Ideally I wanted my briefs to fit my body like what is shown on the model in the picture. I suspect the model is wearing a Small as well. My only slight disappointment would be with the waistband. I feel that it could have used a bit more stretch, and been a little higher quality. Perhaps a Medium would have given me more stretch? Then what would the trade-off be? I assume the medium would give me excess fabric in the seat and crotch. So just be careful when ordering your size. Maybe it's okay, but to me the elastic on the inside looks a little cheap, and some of the stitching looks uneven. I'm hoping they will wear well and stand the test of time. If they fail or fall apart, I won't be pleased. However right now I'm pleased with my purchase, and I hope to buy more. I would recommend them to other guys to try as well."
4.0,I wore this so much it works great to shape your body plus great for working out in. Seams did burst open at some seams had it fixed. I would buy one a little more better with west and tear. But overall this item has been in my collection for awhile now. I still love it lol
4.0,Love the charm but the chain was broken into several pieces when I received it.
4.0,"Looks fabulous, like shiny patent leather! This product is unique in that it has 3 places to attach your hosiery on each side - gives it a really sexy look, that's very attention getting!"
4.0,"This two piece dress is well made with a generous cut.  Different reviews said to size up with the Amerimark brand, so I did.  I think the 16w would have been a perfect fit and true to size.  The fabric is a heavy thicker knit than I expected but it hangs well whe me wearing.  It almost reminds me of the heavier double knits from the 70’s but a softer, nicer fabric than back then."
4.0,"Pretty smooth feeling. Not sure I really like the look (on me), but there's nothing bad about the design or fit."
4.0,Perfect for little boys with no booty to keep their pants up.
4.0,(p.s. i had not planned on writing a review until having worn them through the winter however i was offered a gift card to give a review.) I live in Illinois in the Chicagoland area so i know what cold is lbs. These socks are definitely warm socks and you wont regret buying them. I bought about 4 different brands over the last 2 months and these are easily the second best pair that i bought. (first place goes to my bymore socks but do note that these Vigrace pair gives you an extra set of socks for the same price). They're Comfortable and my feet stayed warm even when walking outside on cold windy chicago days. We will see how they handle the snow once we get it (sigh).
4.0,"They’re nice. I’ve been wearing them daily for about 2 weeks now and they haven’t tarnished and did not make my sensitive skin breakout. Which is great! I rated this a -4- because one of my earrings didn’t have the hole to secure the wire post. It kept falling out of my ear. I contacted the seller and was told that I needed to adjust/bend the wire to make the earring remain clasped. That didn’t change the fact that only one earring has a hole but I was able to get it to stay. They were only $10 and some change, so I can deal with these issues. I originally bought these for my goddaughter but decided to keep them for myself to see how my skin reacts and the ease of clasping them before I bought her a pair. I’m not buying her a pair because I don’t want my goddaughter’s mother to have to rig the earring to stay in her ear. Also, the seller’s response made me think the clasp hole issue is common. My goddaughter’s mother has hang-ups about uniformity, so one earring with a hole and the other without would bother her. We all have our quirks... that’s hers. Plus, I wouldn’t give a gift like that no matter the price. If you need a simple hoop then these may be what you’ve been looking for."
4.0,"A little wide towards the bottom, but beautiful color."
4.0,This top did not hide my rolls the way I’d hoped
4.0,Its great but its not really rusted. More like paint to make it look rusted. Its already rubbed off some around the eyes. Otherwise its held up well.
4.0,"A good reliable watch. My old watch still going strong except the strap broke. The straps don't seem to last very long. My old watch , same model has lasted me for eight years- and I have not had to replace the battery in it. I'm waiting for the replacement strap. I think it's coming by fast camel."
4.0,Super cute! But stiffer material than I expected. Not very forgiving. But did offer me support enough to not have to wear a bra!
4.0,Cute dress but fits small<br />Pattern was to busy for me
4.0,Only downside is that the upper waist part keeps trying to fold over and down. It isn't a tight tummy control material
4.0,Bigger than expected. Still super cute.
4.0,Very nice fit.  I ordered med it will not shrink or stretch.  Color is brighter in person
4.0,"Good looking, sized right, comfortable. My only complaint is I had to sew the right pocket because of a hole that it came with."
4.0,Good value got for my son he said they r a lil tight but his legs are swallow so we shall see as time goes on.
4.0,"I love the mesh overlay! It’s lose enough that a pregnant belly can grow beneath it, but by no means unflattering if not in that stage of life. The bra portion straps were a little loser than I anticipated, but definitely wearable and no one have noticed other than me!"
4.0,"The dress looked better on. When I saw it I was like this is going back but when I put on its cute the bow is not as big as picture it's still cute. I'm 6'0, 215 pounds I got a 2XL and it hits the knee very appropriate length and not tight. It's cotton so stretches and very comfy I need white for church."
4.0,I really like the shoe shields
4.0,"Let me start by saying how very excited I was to order this. I mean look at the picture, does it not look beautiful? When I received it, I was so excited to try it on, I rarely ever buy jewelry for myself and if I do I hardly ever wear it, but this piece just called to me. So I was beyond disappointed when it did not fit correctly, but the little pearl that hangs down, just did not. It kept getting caught in the little leaf. I guess I definitely did not get the impression that this might be a &#34;choker&#34; type necklace. However, I am pretty disappointed at the crappy fit for me. Maybe if it was 3 or 4 inches longer it would sit right for me. I am going to give this to my mom for mother's day as she has a dainty neck and I hope it sits better on her. I received this for free or discount for my unbiased truthful review."
4.0,Use almost every day especially while traveling
4.0,It really is a nice dress and I got tons of complements on it. The fit is great and super breathable. It is a little on the thin side so be mindful when choosing your undergarments. I took it down a star because the peaks at the top of the dress flopped some for most of the day even when I had it pulled down my shoulders. Also the lace is pretty delicate and snags in jsit about anything
4.0,The fit is good but the sleeve length is just too small after a wash cycle. I would advertise it as 3/4th sleeve.  Otherwise it's very comfortable and I wear it everywhere. I'm 5'6&#34; tall and I wear a medium in all my tops so I bought a medium in this and it fit perfectly.
4.0,Needs a button
4.0,"Colors are good, shirt fits well."
4.0,"It's a nice, fun top...but it does run big, and I wish the sleeves weren't so super long."
4.0,It's super low cut in the chest but really cute.  The quality is nice and the seller was friendly and easy to work with.
4.0,Great suit. My daughter is tiny and I got the smallest size and it fit her perfect.
4.0,"I love the quality and the design of this dress. However it's quite large, very wide. I decided that I would return it but then I tried it with a belt and it's absolutely cuter. Wearing the belt makes it a little short in the front but I usually have an problem with the back, not an issue with this dress. I'm usually a size M-L in dresses  and I ordered the L. Probably could wear a M without the belt and it would work. I'm also 5'4 so on a taller person this could be very short. The v neck is low for my taste, might wear something underneath."
4.0,I was under the impression the material would be cotton. But the dress is still beautiful
4.0,"Product fits 'snug' to your size, for me that was in a positive manner. No lining so you'll need a slip (most clothes these days do not have loners, however. Good product for the cost."
4.0,"Little snug, but a great bracelet!!!"
4.0,bottoms run a little large. but the top runs small. I'm a 36 d and had to order a XXL just to fit my breast. I would recommend  going up a size or two. I'm usually a medium or large.
4.0,"very nice, sturdy.  if it had a lining inside it would be perfect."
4.0,They look just as cute in person. And once you get them on they are comfortable. But there are a lot of random strings in there so putting them on my toe gets hung sometimes-but once they are on I’m happy-especially for the discounted price
4.0,I was looking for something to put yarn in for my stay at the hospital.  It's well made but the zipper is backwards.
4.0,They are great but the sticky bottoms aren’t that great. They still slide a bit. Not very good grip but they do have enough for what I’m doing.
4.0,Loved this suit. Fit as expected
4.0,"Not a five for a few reasons:<br /><br />1 - the pins are far from nice (hard to depress the spring from both ends), but this isn't a show stopper.  If you take care when removing the original pins, you can re-use those.<br />2 - the tool it comes with doesn't fit (or not without significant force) between the leather band and the watch's casing.  I had to use a knife blade.<br />3 - personal preference; fit:  I don't like a tight fitting watch band, but for the purposes of a watch that monitors heart rate, etc. this is probably a good thing.  That said, it's not horribly uncomfortable, but it's not particularly comfortable either.  Then again, my wrists are bigger than average, so maybe that's just me.<br />4 - overall quality:  the band has a reasonable amount of weight/heft to it and feels like it's decent quality, but upon closer inspection, is feels and sounds less than stellar; a little chintzy.  The clasp is not smooth and doesn't always snap closed easily; more often than not I have to depress the release button to get it to clasp.<br /><br />Overall:  Since this band is not expensive by any watch band standards, I can't fault it more than one star.  It's not amazing, but it's definitely worth what I paid for it.  Be forewarned though, be careful removing the band because you may want to use the original pins as they are dramatically nicer than the ones supplied.  The band looks good.  I bought black for my black Moto 360 and the color match is pretty darn good.  The overall quality isn't immediately clear, so we'll see how it holds up over time."
4.0,The shirt is well made and high quality. I ordered it for my husband but it runs a bit too small. My adult son is a smaller size and was able to wear it. He says that it's comfortable and washes well. The price point is on par for the quality.
4.0,This is beautiful band. It doesn't look sturdy in the picture but it is very sturdy. I put on a black case cover (my watch is rose pink) then put on the black band and  WOW my watch turned into a beautiful piece of jewelry. Easy to install. Recommend this buy 100%
4.0,It's nice and stretchy but definitely better suited for winters. Material would be too warm for summer. The print is pretty. My only issue is that the fabric started to pile quite quickly.
4.0,"Well made. Hoop skirt will need some attention,  but overall, costume well worth the price.  Headband was included as well. Velvety fabric was surprising."
4.0,I wish I knew beforehand that these shoes run small.  I fit in a size 10 but with their 10 I could not get the shoe on.  If you'er thinking of buying these I would advise you to order the next largest size.  Sadly had to return for a refund.  They look like really nice shoes.  If I can get them in a size 11 I'll be happy.  I knocked off a star because of fitting only not for quality of shoe. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,Maybe a bit big. Nice iverall
4.0,Snap came loose 1st time dr pulled it off
4.0,I should send it back the size doesnt fit me but I have lost 5 lbs this week from stress so maybe they will fit sometime soon lol 😅<br /><br />Great quality though
4.0,"My husband likes green, so I ordered this.  He absolutely LOVED IT!!  I've gotten a better reaction from this nightie than any other.  He actually said I looked ""beautiful"" in it.  It has criss-cross straps in back.  You put your head through first, then put your arms through, then tighten the straps in back till you can tie it.  The bottoms are a thong, by the way."
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for a friend so I can't give the full five since I don't wear it. But it was delivered on time, the product seemed like a pretty good. Happy overall as a buyer. Thanks."
4.0,And that would be the one that said decent size. I was a little bit surprised to find out how small these were. I guess I missed that in the product description somewhere also to find it that there was just one of everything who was just one ring but then I forgot all those people that have eyebrows and nose is pierced and then I cringe a little bit then again the reason I want two is for my nipple piercing. These would probably be great for a beginner which I consider myself to be. These truly are a great deal in every color metal could come in but most of them in too many gauges I can not use. and only one of each
4.0,"I bought these for a friend who has circulation issues that cause her legs to ache when they get cold.  She bought a pair of knee high cable knit socks, locally, that helped, but they were a discontinued item, so she couldn't find them again.<br />She was very happy to receive these, and said that they work well for her issues.  Her only negative comment about them was that they were kind of &#34;scratchy or rough&#34;.  She washed them and used fabric softener in the rinse, which took care of that issue."
4.0,"Ring is beautiful. But HUGE disappointment...no sooner I paid over $100 for it, the price went down to $49!!!"
4.0,I love these sunglasses they are very light weight and polarized. I have a pair for myself although when I ordered another pair as a gift they didn't arrive with a case as my first pair did. That's the only downside .
4.0,nice feel in your hand
4.0,VERY NICE. TWO WERE A LITTLE BIG BUT EASY TO FIX.
4.0,"This is a very nice shirt. I bought the purple in a Large. I usually wear M/L so I sized up a little. It fits perfectly. I has quite a bit of stretch so I could probably fit in the M but I don't like things tight. This fits nicely, not too small or too large. The length is perfect for wearing with leggings and the seaming at the waist pulls it in just enough to not look like a maternity top! Overall very very happy. I think I need it in other colors!"
4.0,"My son loved them! He was so excited to open this up. He is obsessed with sharks, so this went well with his collection. He had been asking for them for a while(saw similar ones at target nowhere close to his size). Although he is a boys size two and this did not go up to 2(like 1-1 1/2), it still fits him for the time being(well he makes them fit). They form fit after a little bit."
4.0,Super nice I wish I would have gotten the red pair but I'm content with my colors. I didn't give it 5 stars because the tag on the back is itchy as hell. I had to cut them all off. The rest is perfect.
4.0,Was a little smaller (more delicate) than I thought it would be. This is an EXTREME close up picture
4.0,it was good quality and not flimsy
4.0,I like the length and weight of these earrings I will keep them but after a few hours of wear they do start to feel like they are pinching the ears maybe because of the thin pin like front part of the clip on . So I will wear these in small doses
4.0,"I am giving it four stars because it is a pretty hat and it is light for the summer, but I am very disappointed because it took so long to arrive and I have a small head to begin with, and it is tight."
4.0,Good glasses but a little to small for my taste
4.0,"Had to go up a full size to find my fit, but once on it's great. I have received many compliments. Holds up well considering I'm rough with my hands/ring. Light scratches but no big deal. Highly recommend."
4.0,"Fits somewhat on the short side - I'm 5'2&#34;, 145lbs, and it barely covers my stomach. Stretchy though, and made of thick material. One strap is a bit wonky on mine but it will be a quick sewing fix and isn't noticeable anyway. I bought this for layering and it definitely does well for that purpose."
4.0,The dress is very flowy and very loose throughout the body. My only complaint would be that as flowy as the dress is the arm hole is a tad tight feeling even when I let the straps out all the way.
4.0,"Great shirt. Fits as expected, nice material"
4.0,Had to have it hem was to long
4.0,"The interior could use some lining, but I love the ornate style of it and the feel of the exterior of the material."
4.0,Not as bright as the picture but still nice. The top is a bit big and bulky. I personally don't mind it since its well rounded and smooth. Came in a bit earlier then expected.
4.0,"For the price you can't go wrong, the loop part of these extensions are a bit smaller then the ones I usually purchase."
4.0,"Great material, dries quickly but could have been a bit longer."
4.0,As advertised. Stainless steel and long enough to go around a 9 inch wrist.
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for a friend.  They love them, saying that they fit fine and are quite comfortable.  That's about all I can say"
4.0,Beautiful dress.  It was a little small for the size. No zippers so the dress is pulled over the head.
4.0,"Wife likes them, that's all that matters!"
4.0,"They are purple with a white boarder, I know im splitting hairs"
4.0,"The fit of the body suit is great I purchased an XL no tightness not too lose, the skirt attcched has a belt that's adjustable. Only issue which I did read on prior reviews is that the boob area is cut small and the strap that ties around your neck hits right in the middle of your boobs. I basically will be wearing boob tape so things stay in place and nothing slips out lol."
4.0,I absolutely love the quality of this dress it's a great buy but my only advice is to buy a size down I wear a large and that what I bought but I have to take it to be taken in....
4.0,"When I opened it and felt fabric, saw pattern, I was so happy. But unfortunately I couldn't wear them because they ran so small in the waste compared to other similar style pants."
4.0,"These are adorable and though longer than my skim feet they stay on!  The mask is sized for a child's head, however so don't expect to be able to wear it!"
4.0,Really pretty dress. A little right up top for me. For every where perfectly. I'm 5'10 and 40D 28 34.
4.0,t's pretty good.
4.0,I loved this dresses because it had pockets. Very simple and looked and felt wonderful. The material was super comfortable.
4.0,Good fit for my 11 year old granddaughter. The color and fabric are different in the pic.
4.0,"I loved them , BUT. They stained with a drop of water on them or anything else. It's to bad I drop a little water on them and it stained, they do have lining and they are warm, not snow warm! But very comfortable, but I will not walk around with dirty stained looking boots"
4.0,The string is very low quality which sucks because obviously we wanted these to last
4.0,Cute but clearly inexpensive costume piece
4.0,"This is a beautiful tiara/headband. It looks like it should cost a lot more than it does. It's rather heavy so I'm a bit worried about that--I haven't worn it for dress-up day yet. In watching Downton Abbey, the women seem to wear theirs more in their hair, almost like a forward-facing headband. I'm going to try it that way rather than around my forehead."
4.0,The kilt is gorgeous and wraps around in the most unique fashion. Luckily I'm hitting cardio like my life depended on it and I'll be ready in 45 days when I need to... otherwise I'd send it back. I'd compare the sizes to Calvin Klein or Ralph Lauren. They're not made for curves and hips but they look so dope when curves are in them.
4.0,A litte bit big but overall I love their comfort and flexibility!
4.0,Since the shirt is a wrap shirt some of the extra sizing can be camouflaged and it still looks great on.  The colors are vibrant and look very summery.  The fabric would work well for traveling because there wasn’t much wrinkling.
4.0,Nice dress sleeve more dressy than body of dress
4.0,"5'2""  123lbs and ordered a medium... Should have ordered a Small it is supposed to be loose but this was way big/tent on me.  I will belt as not time to return before needing it.  Fun print for Christmas gathering at work tho."
4.0,"These are great. Love the support on my goods. They are tight, but not uncomfortably tight. They keep me warm. Perfect for a chilly day out cycling."
4.0,"Not as good as the German made socks that are impossible to purchase now, but they fit properly and did keep the feet warm during frigid nights.  SUPER compliments to the vendor's shipping - shipped from UK and arrived earlier than expected!"
4.0,Be careful of your height
4.0,This is a sure thing. Made well too.
4.0,So pretty. The only downside is the chain constantly breaks. I put it back together but it's very annoying.
4.0,Love these earrings! Wish they came with more rubber backs
4.0,"This slipper is adorable, cute, soft, but too small for my adult male feet. I looked at the chart when buying, but saw no reference to MEN, only women and thought they might be foreign assembled and assumed they forgot to say MEN; confusing.  I should have sent a question to the seller, but not familiar with that process and thought I had figured it out anyway. Also I had several things in my order other than slippers. So I messed up and bought the largest pair not fully understanding the half chart. I think children will enjoy this. I collect unusual slippers and this one looked interesting, but now I am stuck with it. Perhaps a Christmas gift now. Actually I am an adult Men's size 10 1/2 so I am just half an inch too long. LOL"
4.0,"Just what I wanted for protecting my face when walking. I can't use sunscreen on my face due to sensitivity issues. The brim of this hat is wide enough to shade my whole face. The open crown  keeps me cool and allows me to wear my hair up. My only complaint is that because the hat can be rolled up, the brim is always a little wavy."
4.0,It fits a little big but it still looked nice. I gave it four stars because the clasp broke a few weeks later.
4.0,"I love this hat, but it does run a little big. Its probably better as a men's hat, but I still wore it!"
4.0,Definitely great for a toddler. A small child under the age of 8 it’s a bit small. Overall nice though
4.0,The size fit nice. True fit. I wish the quality of the shirt material was better.
4.0,Cups too small. But replaced with D cups. Very slimming go by their sizing ordered 5x normally wear 1-2x
4.0,"I like everything about this purse except it's shape. It is smaller at the top than the bottom. So the bottom creates pockets on the sides. It's minor and I'll get over as I like everything else so much. It is well made, great color, etc."
4.0,The dress looks like the picture. The only thing is that it's a little sheer. The material looks like linen.
4.0,"Great one piece dress for on the go. Just as described and pictured. Decent quality, nothing like a costume as described by a previous reviewer."
4.0,"Beautiful, good"
4.0,Great length and fabric! Looks more upscale. Beach/ pool staple
4.0,"​<br />  The materials in this belt and the belt's general finish are good.  The webbing is as advertised and could probably hold a lot more weight than any of us could carry up some stairs.  Likewise the buckle appears well made, and of good materials.  I have no concerns about this belt failing to function as described.  I certainly find it preferable, as a work belt, to the leather belts I've used for years.<br /><br />  I've attached a picture of the tab to offer an example of the quality of the finishing on this belt.  It's well done.  It's well rounded, there are no annoying ridges -- it's nice and flat.  That's a good sign.<br /><br />  I do have a couple of issues, one aesthetic and one functional.  As others have noted the buckle is rather unattractive.  Like them I would not use this belt anywhere but in a physical labor work setting.<br /><br />  The bigger issue for me is the way the belt buckle works.  First let me describe how a competitor's belt I evaluated last week works.  To tighten that belt you pull on the end of the belt.  A ratchet mechanism in the buckle gives what feels like about 1/8"" increments of latching.  That makes tightening the belt to a comfortable setting really easy.  To loosen the belt you push on a tab on the back of the buckle and the belt plays out.  If you don't plan to remove the belt from your pants for a while these are the only operations you need to know.  Both are quick and give rapid, satisfying results on belt tension.<br /><br />  In contrast, with this belt you have to lift a clasp that holds the belt setting in place.  I've attached a picture of the clasp in its open position.  Generally you can get the clasp to pop open if you pull straight out away from your body on the loose end of the belt.  Sometimes it can take some work and prying fingers may be needed.  Once the clasp is open you can set the tightness as you wish.  Then you push the clasp down to lock in the setting.  If you don't like the setting, you need to go through the whole process again.  If you want to loosen the belt a bit after a big meal, you need to go through the same process.  It's much more elaborate than the first belt I described.<br /><br />  One advantage this belt has over the competitor's is the buckle can be opened very easily, leaving the belt length setting as you last set it, and the belt free to be removed from your pants.  With the competitor's belt, if you want to separate the two ends, say to remove it from your pants, you have to press on the tab on the back and pull the belt all the way through the buckle.  I guess which approach you might like more depends on how often you expect to adjust the belt vs how often you expect to remove it from your pants.  I do a lot more adjusting than belt insertion and removal from my pants so I prefer the first design.<br /><br />  As other reviewers have noted this belt comes in one length: about 42"".  If your waist is a fair bit less than 42"" then you'll probably want to shorten this belt, as I will be doing.  That will require some work to get the tab looking as good as what I've shown you get when you first receive the belt."
4.0,"I bought this for my wife. She really liked it and got lots of compliments on it. It looks like it is going to show wear pretty quickly so she's trying to be careful about not washing it too often or allow things like her purse strap to rub against the same place repeatedly. For the price, it seems like a good buy."
4.0,Product was as represented on ad
4.0,The chain was a bit flimsy but the locket part was beautiful!
4.0,"Granddaughter loved them, but run small, definitely size up"
4.0,It's cute but not at all warm. Wore with some velour leggings to keep warm.
4.0,"Very nice, but thin material.  I love the versatility! Also, very, very long! Overall, great price (under $15) and prime eligible :)"
4.0,"The battery worked well, restoring my Vita to like-new condition. The tools were a little cheap, but they did the job. I wouldn't expect hem to last more than one or two times opening the device, though. All in all, with an online guide, you should be able to perform the procedure in 20 or 30 minutes, depending on how careful you are."
4.0,The set is beautiful. The side with print is very soft but the interior closet to skin is rough. I am going to wash with softener to see if it helps. The size is as described.
4.0,Not bad comfortable nice and lite stitching leaves a lil to be desired but overall great
4.0,Shirt fit well. I got a small for my 122lb daughter. Nice color material is thin though.
4.0,Loved the dress but its quite stretchy elastic type material and runs big. The material although stretchy is comparable to high end and very nice weight and feel. Will be getting smaller size.
4.0,"It is as gorgeous as it looks. Colors are vibrant, material isn't cheap, no defects or asymmetry, when I ordered it wasnt even in stock yet it arrived 2 days earlier than expected so that's great..  HOWEVER the bust is HUGE! Yes i checked the chart and ordered accordingly (i guess i had no other choice because i needed the smallest size). Shoulders are okay, bust is huge, waist could be smaller. I'm thinking maybe they mistakenly labeled a medium size S and i got that one. And if this is the true S then they need XS. I am really obsessed with it so I'm not giving it back, but as you can see in the pictures i had to use a pin which left tiny holes in the fabric.<br />(I am 5'4"", 140lbs, my normal dress size is 2 or xs/s, the bra I'm wearing in the photos is a 32C VS push-up)"
4.0,"Fit a little small in the chest but sleeve length was perfect, I'm 6'1"", 200 lbs. Lights work great. Good purchase"
4.0,Cheap price cute. But they do hurt. I had to stretch them out because they were so tight and irritating.
4.0,Love this necklace - exceeded my expectations.
4.0,Mejor de lo qué esperaba por el precio !
4.0,Adorable dress and vest! It'll be perfect for our family photos. It does seem to run a tad small in my opinion but my daughter is also a bit of a giant.
4.0,I can’t post a picture because I sent mine back it’s misleading because they make it look like a tank top when it’s really like a bra it’s a quarter shirt not half shirt quarter shirt
4.0,I like the look and feel of these. The one with tigers eye has a slightly loose knot so it will loosen. I plan to stitch around the strings to tighten it up.
4.0,"I really like the look and feel of this sports bra.  It's very soft, the criss-cross back looks great and is just like the photo.  I would agree that it's definitely a medium support bra especially for larger chests like mine.  I would also recommend using the sizing chart since I ordered a large for my 38D and should have gone with an XL.  I'm still happy with it and can wear it but it obviously doesn't quite fit as it should.  Overall, a good purchase."
4.0,"I love the pants, color, design & even though the fit is lil too large for me I love the look & especially the material"
4.0,Came folded and is taking a while to flatten out. A bit big. Seems to be a good value for the price.
4.0,This sweater dress came and I was a bit surprised on its sizing.  I ordered a small it is still quite over-sized.  If you care looking for form fitting- this isn't for you.  If you are looking for warm practical and comfy- order it!
4.0,I have a super-narrow foot so I wear toeless socks to ‘fill in’ the space in my open toe heals for when I go out dancing!  It helps cushion my foot from getting blistered from rubbing against the too loose vamp or heel well.
4.0,Really pretty but the wires are a little thin so be careful when adjusting them.
4.0,"I liked the look of this product, but unfortunately one of the earrings was factory defective and missing the rhinestones on one side!  had to send it back."
4.0,The grey is much darker than pictured and I wish it was a little wider. It has a lot of compartments and is of good quality.
4.0,"For the price this is a great sports bra. It’s much better quality than I expected. The material is thick enough to provide plenty of coverage and no show through. I took a chance getting the L, as I usually need an XL in sports bras. It is snug, an XL would have been better, but it isn’t offered. I’m a 38D or 36DD, 5’4” 162lbs."
4.0,My son has a large head (size 8 3/8 hat) and these fit his face perfectly.  The only thing that makes them less than perfect is the length of the temple pieces.  If they had been 155mm instead of 150 they'd be 100%.
4.0,2018: Fits very nice in the bust. I’m 34C.<br /><br />Update: it’s 2021 and this dress just came apart on one side after a few years. Still love it! And I’m sad it’s out of stock.
4.0,"Beautiful item, very pretty."
4.0,"Cute, but a bit large."
4.0,I really like the color and that it is 100% cotton.  Great for a cover up at the beach!
4.0,I was hoping for a nice wide A-line dress but this one is a little narrow. If you're a pear shape like I am order a size or two up.<br />I'm giving the dress 4 stars because it's well made.
4.0,Right size & color
4.0,It wasn't as tight as I wanted it to be
4.0,"Its a cute outfit. Looks just like the picture. Only problem, I ordered a 2-3yr for my daughter bc she is 3 but very tiny. The top fit perfectly, but the bottoms were too tight. Luckily my mom is a seamstress so she removed the elastic and fitted it to my daughter, now its perfect!"
4.0,This is much heavier than I thought it would be.  We will see if I can stand the Mexican heat in this number.
4.0,"This dress is lovely! The fabric is soft and not too thin, while the print is perfect! I am 4'11&#34;, 150, 40DD -all of my weight is in my boobs and muffin top. This disguises it well. Although it is advertised as a dress, someone thinner and younger than me could wear it as such. It is approximately six inches above my knee, so I will wear it as a tunic  I look forward to comfortably enjoying this dress . Hope to be able to purchase more in different colors.I gave it four stars because of the length, which , since I purchased an extra large, should have been a bit longer to be called a dress."
4.0,"They shipped fast and accurately. However, the sizing is a little small. I'd get the next size to insure fit."
4.0,Nicely made but I read something that changed my mind so relectanly sent it back.
4.0,These socks came at a perfect time.  They're warm the weather is cold and they fit well.
4.0,These shirts are the cutest! They have a good stretch to them and I have a mommy tummy so I need some stretch. They do have a tendency to ride up and I have to pull them down but I still love them!
4.0,Fits small but great versatile skirt. Can dress up or down. Stretch denim gives the skirt a comfortable fit.
4.0,"I liked them; they are very high quality. However, they ONLY reflect yellow, not multiple colors like in some of the pics. They are also fairly large and I wouldn't wear them for work, only dress-up. Great earrings"
4.0,"I'm usually a medium size, but this runs large. So I should've gotten a smaller size.I'm using this dress as a maternity dress now so the size doesn't bother me."
4.0,The only minor complain is that the face is not backlit. The light barley illuminated the face in the dark.
4.0,"I picked one size larger than what my boy wears and I'm glad I did. The shirt is definitely a slim fit and is snug. My boy is 20 months old and is an average sized kid. I ordered the 3T and that worked. My boy doesn't stay still or pose for pictures so it was hard for us to get a good shot of him and clearly ready the shirt. We had to hold his hands up and pose with him so that you could see what the shirt said clearly. Other than that I loved the shirt, quality and the lettering is pretty secure to the shirt."
4.0,"As is with Affliction items the graphics are unbeatably awesome. Shirt material is kind of thin. Will be a victim of belly holes.  Good for a wear or 2. I buy for the design.<br />Fast communication from seller, but is a ripoff for shipping for multiple items!"
4.0,I purchased an xl and I am 5ft 220 lbs. the dress fit perfectly on my chunky arms. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lining doesn’t go all the way to the end of the dress.
4.0,"This is super cute. I like how it flatters my chest area and waist. I bought a size large and it fit great. I am 5'5&#34;, 160, 36C and wear a size 10 pants and med to large shirt depending on style and brand. Don't worry about your cha chas falling out of the top lol, they actually are pretty snug up in there. The only thing that I didnt like about this was that the zipper is a pain in the butt to get up in the back on your own, but after a few stretchy tries, it works. The fabric is super soft, feels great against the skin. This isnt a cheap POS, actually is decently made. Very pretty, very nice!"
4.0,"It's super cute and comfy, I like how it doesn't hug my tummy/love handle area.. but the pockets are a bit odd.. but still really like. It seems to run a little large, but I like that!"
4.0,Surprisingly soft scarf. My daughter/AOT fan loves it.
4.0,Looks good brought as a gift
4.0,"Love this hat, a bit small but worth the money.  The 🤟🏼 symbol looks good. I am very pleased!"
4.0,Only problem was I wasn't quite sure how to lay the top of it because it kept moving up & my stomach was out.
4.0,They are nice.  I would order them again if I had to.  I think my future daughter-in-law is going to be happy with them.  Thank You
4.0,My lady looks sexy in dragons.
4.0,"I really bought these to keep my dermatologist at bay. She scolds me at every appointment for riding my motorcycle sleeveless in the summer time. They do a great job of sun blocking, but they also cool very nicely at moderate speed even in bright sun. You do have to adjust (pull up) them occasionally, but they don't fall all the way down or anything. They just creep a bit over time. Worthwhile purchase if you ask me!"
4.0,perfect fit love it love it
4.0,"I had shoulder replacement  surgery n the shirts came in handy for dressing.  My only complaint is why not more colors like navy blue, red, purple etc.  People cant always wear black n white when they leave the house."
4.0,"Not the quality the pics lead you to think, but for the price not bad."
4.0,Came fast. Size medium fits well no issue I'm size 10.
4.0,Real nice product.
4.0,Its a good quality top for the price. I got the heather gray color and its pretty. I don't understand the random rhinestone on the shirt but you can easily remove it. Other than that it seems like a good buy.
4.0,If your kiddos wears ponytail tails or is older than 5 this might fit a bit more snug than you want.
4.0,Cute thing. Like it. :-)
4.0,Product arrived on time and fit wel.
4.0,Very nice but very light and a bit cheap.
4.0,Great look and quality material
4.0,"I love iHeartRaves clothing. I have many pieces. I picked this top with hopes to take it to Burning Man, which I still plan to so. The top itself is very pretty and better made than some other iHeartRaves products. However I am not a fan of how this the bra padding is. I typically wear a size small and sometimes extra small, but i feel this product is a bit tight on it's fit, this could be because I have been working out a bit more, but I don't think I have had that much gains."
4.0,"Beautiful but a little smaller for my taste,so my 10 year old daughter is using them"
4.0,"I liked the length (barely need to bend) as well as the sturdiness of the product- but the metal is quite heavy, so if it slips out of your hand- it could crack the tile floors. Be careful while using it."
4.0,Me gusto como quedo
4.0,"Seems to be a great watch,  I guess the band would be more durable if I paid more."
4.0,"looks great, wear them every day not bad for the price would recommend them to a friend I am satisfied. Could have used a better material to make."
4.0,"A little tight around the waist, should have ordered a large, instead of a medium, but, other than that, it's perfect. Thank You."
4.0,"The band itself is good quality. The screws however did not fit the screwdriver at all - the inside of the nail head was completely smooth and there were no grooves to fit the screwdriver into. I had to use the screws that came with the original watchband. Not a big deal, they could have been mispackaged."
4.0,"This hoodie is made from nice material and feels great. The size fits a little large for me as the pocket for the hands is way below my waist. I would buy another Russell Athletic, just go down 1 size and check the fit on it."
4.0,"It arrived folded and smushed, so not really appearing like the picture. I will placed it on a Styrofoam mold, and see if it ""unfolds""."
4.0,Got this for a costume and it worked perfectly. The stitching around the strings is a little shoddy and the shoulder fit is a little awkward. Other wise the crushed velvet feels nice and the lining is very comfortable.
4.0,"Cute boots, comfortable."
4.0,I like it. It fitted just right!
4.0,"Smaller than I expected, but maybe our baby has big feet, it's hard to find right size for her anyways. Also, our 1 yo is drifting on the floor in this socks, and there's nothing to prevent from it, no rubber on the bottom."
4.0,"The product is great. I was very surprised by the shipping material. It was shipped in a clear, thin plastic bag. Luckily it arrived undamaged, but am very surprised it wasn't."
4.0,Beautiful necklace! But it came a little broken...Im so glad i was able to fix it a little hopefully it wont fall apart again.
4.0,Was a Christmas gift she I've the earings.
4.0,"Very flimsy, but everybody loves its vivid color."
4.0,Worth my money!!!
4.0,"Very cute. Getting lots of compliments. It's mostly comfortable, but the sleeves are weird and itchy as hell!"
4.0,Good quality and the company works hard to make sure your happy with the product.  I’d order a size larger than you normally wear is my only recommendation.
4.0,"Wrinkles everywhere from the shipping!<br />Although, it is a beautiful hat.<br />Do not try to iron it too much, the felt will melt."
4.0,Dance dress is very cute and worth the $14 I paid. Not as high quality material as from a dance floor but also not as pricey. I would order from this company again.
4.0,It's for a girl
4.0,I purchased this because my wedding ring fits too snug sometimes so where I can't even get it over my knuckle.  I just wanted something to use on the days my finger is swollen.  Works great and its pretty!
4.0,"True to size, great color. Only bad thing is we order 5 and 1/5 had different buttons. Same color just different style buttons."
4.0,Cufflinks are cheap but I bought this for the tie clip which works as it should. I get compliments on it almost everytime I wear it!
4.0,Bought a few cheaper watches here and this is by far the best looks good and auto winding is very nice
4.0,Should have ordered a size down for 4-6 USA sizing.
4.0,Super belt!! I highly recommend and I’m picky!!!
4.0,The gown fit a little tighter than I wanted. The fabric was a little more sheer than I expected but seemed nice. Just not what I was wanting.
4.0,Last year I bought my regular size and it was tight these shirts run small<br /><br />Bought the bigger size this year fits perfect
4.0,"No complains, especially in natural surfaces."
4.0,"I wish extra small was available because the small is way too big on top (it fits worse than 4-6 usually does on me). I'm 5'-5&#34; and 135, with most of my weight on the bottom, so I usually go for 0-2 on top and 8-10 on the bottom. It's too big in the waist and up.<br /><br />I love it other than the way it fits on top, so I'm planning on getting it tailored. The material is nice and the zipper works well, plus it twirls nicely."
4.0,"I ordered this because of the style, color, fabric and weight, since I'm in a part of Texas where one rarely ever needs a heavy winter coat.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It's very well-made.<br />2. The velvet feels wonderful.<br />3. The length is good. I'm 5'4,"" and it hits me below the knee, almost to the calf.<br />4. It's mostly polyester with a good stretch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It fits me everywhere except the armholes, which are just a bit too tight. Therefore, if I try to wear this over even a lightweight shirt, the armholes will be way too tight. This is where I have trouble fitting most often, so it may be that I'm the only one with this problem. I usually wear a size 16/18, so, for the armholes to fit, I'd probably need a 1x."
4.0,I read other reviews that suggested that these were small. I have a small petite face and these are too big. They do work as promised.
4.0,It the picture it looks like a softer fitting women's tee shirt but it's more like a regular stiff cotton co-gender tee shirt.
4.0,"Went by the other reviews and ordered a 3X!!!!  I've never ordered a 3X in anything!  Top fits ok, bottoms are a little too large.  I normally wear a LG, 5'6, 175 lb."
4.0,Bought this for my daughter and it is bigger and expected.  Would be great if it came in a smaller size.
4.0,The color of this scarf is halloween orange si I will most likely only be able to wear it this month. I am a bit disappointed because I was really hoping for the mustad type yellow.
4.0,"This band seems to be well made.  I have a really small wrist (5.5&#34;) so I am always concerned that the band will not fit.  Since this one has all the holes, it fits.  There is a lot of excess band but the little loop that holds that in place is adjustable so all is good.  I got the pink and white band. It comes with a cover for the watch which changes the color to rose which looks much better than my original gold watch would look with it.  I ordered another one in black and grey."
4.0,"This is soft and comfortable- I bought it to match my daughter for her first Halloween. It worked out perfectly- I would say the size runs a little large, although they are meant to be baggy. Construction on the tail could be a little more detailed but overall great for the price!"
4.0,"This cooling cap is pretty cool! LOL<br />I have a big head. Around 25-27 inches and it fits me great! I always have a hard time finding something that fits my head! :)<br /><br />I got this because I'm going to start a security job where I have to be outside all day. I have not started the job yet but I did wet, wring and snap it just like the instructions. I took it out for a walk in hot 90-100 degree summer day and kept my forehead cool every time I pressed against my skin. That was cool!<br /><br />I'm also an esthetician and I could see this useful for that too! I sweat very easily and this could be great for that kind of work too!<br />It even has a hole to put your ponytail through with a cover over the hole ! That's great! You also tie the cap! It's under the ponytail in the pictures I provided.<br /><br />I just washed and dried it once and seems to be fine! I only gave it 4 stars so I can still test the longevity of the cap! :)"
4.0,"...as advertised.  If the brim was not as wide I would like it.  Must understand, I'm replacing a favorite hat lost in a black hole.<br />I'll keep looking in Amazon, they will get one sometime."
4.0,Cute top. I'm a medium and it fit as expected
4.0,"Although a little on the thinner side it’s still not see through.  I actually love the the cut, the waist detail makes you look smaller and the butt is full coverage.  I definitely recommend.  I’m 5’5 175 and got a large but could of provably gotten away with a medium for a slightly tighter fit in the chest area."
4.0,This is very pretty. The only issue I had is its big.
4.0,I like the sunglasses. I Ordered grey but got black. Will keep them anyway. Other than that love the bling!
4.0,It has a very cute and casual look to it and feel about it.  The fit is alright - It feels like it has a bit more room to it than I'm used to.  The material has kind of a cotton-like feel with some stretch.  I do like the bishop/lantern sleeves and that you can wear it as either a square neck or an off shoulder dress.
4.0,"Very well made. Compresses well with the double zippers,<br /> The only thing I did not like as well was that I was looking for something lighter for overseas travel."
4.0,Don’t wear them as much as I thought I would
4.0,Pretty.  Used on wedding day for one of the girls.
4.0,Nice watch keeps perfect time but hour and minute hands could be larger they are hard to se in the dark.
4.0,Great gift idea for any Office fan.
4.0,Plastic but cool to have
4.0,"I love the boots, but I can only wear them for a short period of time.  I have flat feet so they were a discomfort after a few strides.  The left boot also  feels more snug than the right.  Not bad for the price.  Arrived quickly, too."
4.0,The camera feels unstable when attached to my head. I was going to use it for a POV of going off of a rope swing. I think I will have to use my snow board helmet without the ear muffs. I still like the head band. I'm sure it will come in useful.
4.0,"This was good, however the white of the shirt is a bit too see through. We wanted matching family pajamas and this was the only one reasonableypriced and also 100% cotton."
4.0,Cute dress but little see through.
4.0,"I love these type of compression camisole tanks.  They have removable pads.  You can wear them as outer shirts or underwear.  They give great compression on ur stomach which I needed as I just had surgery.  The fabric is breathable and stretchable and doesn’t roll up on me.<br /><br />However, these are not true to U.S sizing.  I ordered the pack of 3 in size 2 XL.  They sent me two 2XL and one 3XL.  The crazy thing is the 2XL fit like a true American size XL.  And although the White was a 2XL, it fit more loose than the Black 2XL  The 3XL was too big in the bra cup unlike the 2XL.  It was a mess.  I sent them back and exchanged them. I love the tanks so I’m reordering in an attempt to get it right this time."
4.0,I normally wear an xl I ordered the xxl and it was still a bit small. Wearable but snug. The fabric is a light soft stretchy fabric. Feels very nice!
4.0,I love the way they fit and look on me..I gave 1 to my daughter and she loved it for sports practice
4.0,Just as presented and arrived promoptly.
4.0,"Tried to exchange dress for one size larger but it won't except my request. The dress is everything I was looking for but one size to small. If you can get it in your size, you won't be disappointed."
4.0,I love the charm but was disappointed that it wouldn't fit onto my daughter's Pandora bracelet. I ended up buying a necklace for her to wear the charm.
4.0,I ordered XXL fits perfect except it's a little big in the bust area.  The cups that are in the swimsuit move around which is annoying.
4.0,Fair price fOr sharp lOOking ballcap!HOO RAH!(semper fi!)
4.0,Leaving at four for now until I have one of these in for at least to make sure it doesn't cause any irritation. So far so good.
4.0,i like the shirt but i dont like my body in it so i guess it is motivation to lose weight
4.0,"I didn't realize all of the dresses like this are from China. I ordered up one size (from 2x to 3x) and it fit except for my B-cup boobs. It's a beautiful dress and well-made, but I had to return it. It's a shame."
4.0,I want to know if the shoe is like a woman side
4.0,"Very niece, I would buy nother"
4.0,I LIKE TI BUT THE COLOR IS NOT LIKE IN THE PICTURE! A LITTLE BRIGHT. BUT I WILL WORK IT.
4.0,"I bought this for my neice, and she really likes it.  It looks great on her with the bright tie-dye technique and the cropped style."
4.0,I bought it during summer so I haven't worn this out yet but I have tried it on a couple of times. It is a little tighter than I would prefer around my chest but I love how it fits all around.
4.0,Excelente producto ......solo un detalle ....la esperaba um poquito mas gruesa ....fuera de eso todo bien.
4.0,It is very pretty!  Unfortunately it is a very light gray not the medium gray in the picture.  That is why I did not give it 5 stars.
4.0,These are nice compression Knee Hi's - I like the color. I can wear them with Capri pants and still have the support. They are a little short as far as the length in coming up to the knee so I have to adjust them - but again I like the color and the support around my lower leg/ankle/foot.
4.0,Not really beach cover up material but I still like it. Would imagine if you got sunscreen on it it may ruin it. I will wear it. But would be better if cotton. Bought the small and I am 5'4 129 pounds. Fits perfect. Not too tight not too baggy.
4.0,"Soft and comfortable. The length is a tad awkward - either have to pull the strap way up on the temples, which is less comfortable, or leave it dangling, which catches on my life jacket and feels less secure.<br /><br />It floated with my regular glasses and our son's sunglasses (both of which are just under an ounce); didn't get to test it with any heavier glasses.<br /><br />Designed for glasses with narrower temple pieces."
4.0,Tassel length is a little short but it looks good. I do think it's expensive but then it matched my dress perfectly
4.0,This is such a cute swim suit.  I am 5'2 and the length of the suit is perfect.  The material is soft and smooth.  Be careful not to sit on concrete as the material will pull. The bra portion of the suit is fairly thin and does not offer great support.  I have reviewed this product for amazon review trader and received the product at a discount.  My review is my honest opinion.
4.0,"I ordered a large, probably could have gotten away with a medium. But it's comfy"
4.0,Got the shirt because I lost a bet to a UNC fan.  Fits as expected and came in quickly.
4.0,I like it and it is comfortable.  Thanks for the good product.  LMB
4.0,I got lots of compliments . Great top. I am 5.4 and 145lb and I bought a large. It was big but it worked perfectly with a belt.
4.0,"I really like this purse, it's easy to organize but it's definitely smaller than I was expecting.  Maybe I read the dimensions wrong, but I couldn't fit my wallet in this purse (in the purses defense, I have a long wallet), but other than that it's a really nice purse at a very reasonable price."
4.0,Pretty good for the price! Hoping my bf likes them!
4.0,Pretty nice...lost a few sequins before I even ran with it...that is to be expected! It fit just fine...it survived 1 5k...and will be going through another 5k in a few days!
4.0,I use it for work. It is smart enough.
4.0,Go one size up if you wish better experience with socks but it fits as expected.
4.0,"Great quality, beautiful design, shipped from China, took a really long time (more than a month), still recommend.<br />Perfect style for a teen aged daughter, fit is perfect she wears a size 2. Love the color"
4.0,"This super cute on and I got a ton of compliments. I purchased the small size and it is shorter in the torso than I expected, and pockets would be a great addition, but on the whole, glad I bought it! For reference, I am 5'5&#34;, 140lbs and usually wear a size 4 or small."
4.0,"The bracelet is very nicely done, quality is good for the price.  Beads are a little bigger than I wanted and they appear smaller and in picture, but still nice."
4.0,"Buy a size up! I'm always skeptical when i read reviews saying the same but I'm glad i took the advice. I'm very petite. 105 lbs at 5'1&#34;.. Usually sizes small, 0-1, 24..etc but a Medium in this bikini fits.<br /><br />I bought the royal blue color and it looks great. The mesh is actually white not nude. I'm not crazy about the gold bead that sits on top of the bikini triangle so i just slid it to the end of the strap. Not bad at all for a $13 bikini set!"
4.0,These came.way earlier than expected which was fantastic but i was really hoping to get some off the ones advertised in the picture. Instead i received sports related ones that i will never wear and lots of the same design but in different colors.
4.0,"Longer than expected, but they are still cute."
4.0,"So I think this dress is hideous but my seven year old, who is obsessed with cats, absolutely loves it. It’s a Lycra type material so it’s soft and flowy. If your daughter loves cats and rainbows, you should get it."
4.0,"These boots are actually very nice.<br />They fit perfectly and were easy to lace up. High backing to protect the ankle from rolling.<br />They are very durable boots and hold up even with some rough use. It gets very dirty and muddy at work and these keep nice after cleaning.<br /><br />Had no issues stepping in water, which is good since it tends to get rather wet at my night job.<br />And these kept my feet warm and dry, my last boots would leave my feet soaked.<br /><br />As far as weight goes they are lighter then what I am used to so it took some getting used to. But my feet and legs did not get as tired with these. They are definitely very comfortable to wear even for long periods of time.<br /><br />Overall they are a good value for the money given how well they protect the feet."
4.0,"Great and classic ring,<br />So unique"
4.0,"Nice looking watch, accuracy is +4 seconds the first day, that is excellent for automatic in this price range, the band is not good enough, I replaced it. overall, satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Buen product.
4.0,"Item looks exactly like its picture online. Easy to wear.<br />Well-made, colors are truly vivid, sharp print.<br />Runs a little small.<br />Lots of STATICS! My hair was out of control due to staticky qualities of this sweater. Seriously out of control. Must be because of synthetic fibers. I would recommend spraying it with appropriate product to “calm it down”. You could also try to use dryer sheets.<br />I haven’t tried because I only wore it once but I’m sure either one of these options would work."
4.0,The dress is beautiful but I have broad shoulders so it did not work for me.  The material was a little stiff but perhaps after a few times in the washing machine it would soften up.
4.0,Good quality especially for the price. I definitely would recommend this watch to friends. It would be nice if there was a location to download a manual describing the features.
4.0,Did not fit mine sku#004046-04<br />There was a slight gap between lense and frame after installation. Lenses could slide back and forth horizontally. Millimeters off and lense stayed in secure other than gap I would have been pleased.
4.0,"These are quite intricately woven and imaginative.  But they do not wash that well as they tend to bunch up and lose their shape.  For the price, I expected better wash and wear.  I have also purchased  Flora&Fred Women's 3 Pair Pack Vintage Style Cotton Crew Socks.  I find that they are attractive, warm, well made and wash very well.  In addition, the pricing is exceptional as you get three pairs for $12.99."
4.0,"I love my Trayvax Wallet, but I recently went back to the Maxpedition Micro wallet. The Tray is a really cool, and neat wallet, but it started to get uncomfortable when I sit down, and sometimes I can barely slide the cards out. I'll give it another try when my Max wears out!"
4.0,Dress is cute. The material is scratchy. It’s slightly difficult to fluff the dress and make it look good like the picture. It’s basically tule tied around the elastic waist band with a slip underneath. Once you get it fluffed and everything it’s a beautiful dress. I bought 2 and one waist band was super stretchy and the other was pretty firm with min stretch.
4.0,Nice nothing special
4.0,"Seems good quality, recommended. Just not sure how it is full grain leather for a great price. Made in china."
4.0,"Got this in the XL size, based on the size chart, and it seems true to size & close to a size 8.  This brand has plus size versions of their dresses, but I don’t know if Amazon sells them (other sites do); I will look into it since this is small on me, at the moment.<br /><br />Also, this is annoying to zip & unzip due to the sequins being in the path of the zipper.  Docked a star off for that."
4.0,"For the price the quality is as expected, on par with anything you could pick up at a fast fashion store. I use it to add a waist to my dresses that are more free flowing and it adds a little polish and style to the outfit. Just don't expect it to last year's and years with daily use."
4.0,"Very nice band, only thing is it catches my hair on my wrist. Would not recommend if you have hairy wrists."
4.0,"I ordered these shoes for my daughter who hates wearing heels to any event, I must say the shoes were delivered in great condition,an I got what I expected."
4.0,"Beautiful and well packed, however I have some concerns about the material it seems as advertised you need to be cautious about wearing perfumes and where you store them. Definitely I will take care of them until I found a similar ones but made with 925 silver. For now I found the price is okay and they will stand out while I wear them."
4.0,I didn't realize that the dress had an uneven skirt.  I am a little old for that design but I passed it on to a younger person who loves it.
4.0,"Absolutely gorgeous, warm, and comfortable! The only issue is the fact that it is a bit tight around the elbows even though I ordered a medium and I am 5' 2&#34;. Will be seeing if I can also order a large to compare sizes and return the one which I deemed not the right size for me. I love the Sea Beas and the detail in it. The cool thing is, is I am able to show my appreciation of the US Navy and my love of guns (when used safely and by people trained to use them such as me.). And if anyone gets triggered by it for some reason, I can easily switch it to the gorgeous red, crane side which has so much detail and is beautiful!"
4.0,"Much larger and heavier than I anticipated, and not as soft and warm as I expect merino to be. More of a shawl than a scarf."
4.0,Nice fit. Not to clingy. Length is also good.
4.0,"Sleeker copy in a catalog I get (Eastern Serenity or One at a Time.  I'm not sure - maybe they copied it!)  In any case, I think most of my associates and friends will not notice the difference and it is very hand made but in a good way."
4.0,Beautiful but runs very small
4.0,They are cute but for an infant they are kinda large in size. They are extremely tight on the head but they did work and price was great!
4.0,Got these for my 12 year old son. He loves them.
4.0,Very nice. I have a red one as well.
4.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter for her graduation and it fit her well. I was afraid it would look cheap but it didn’t, it’s trally nice"
4.0,"Great little cooler, going to use it to pack my vegan/veggie things when we go camping, I wanted something soft that would break down after all the food is eaten for easier storage.  I love the addition of the little mesh pouch in front.  My only wish for this is that the strap were longer so you could actually sling it over your shoulder.  Other than that, great product and I'm going to get a lot of use out of it."
4.0,"Change review, little snug at the top of the dress and tight at shoulders"
4.0,"I bought a size 4 which on the tag of the dress said size M. I am 5feet 4 and weigh 117 pounds. It fits me perfectly. The sleeves were not tight at all. The waist part was kind of loose but the hips fit well. The chest area fits me well too but if you have a large chest, it might be too tight for you since the fabric does not stretch.  The color of the dress is very bright and I love it. The material is soft and light. I own silk qipoa dresses and this feels similar except the weight of it. overall happy with this purchase especially the price being so reasonable. The zipper was easy to zip up. The button at the neck is not as easy to button up compare to my other dresses. I would buy this dress again in the same size but different color."
4.0,Pretty but didn't realize how tiny they would be. I can't use them but I'll be giving them to a friend with a baby girl.
4.0,Bag Brand is Great. But pattern wasn’t.
4.0,"The base outfit is practically perfect. The skirt is great quality and the accessories are lovely, i love how it’s all detachable so you can really see the layers in the cosplay. The suspenders are good, but may take some extra hole punching to get it to fight perfectly.<br />The only problem is with the accessories. The gloves themselves are pretty large, and don’t really fit at all. The way the large armor piece on the arm fits is very inconvenient- like you can hardly move your elbow. Some of the small ‘3d’ bits fell off but that’s easily fixable. The materia orbs were also very misaligned, but again very fixable."
4.0,"I bought this for my 13 year old son for school. It came on time and looks just like the photo. However, it is a little small for our Middle School needs. My son carries a Chromebook, zip around Trapper, and a lunchbox to school daily. It is a very tight fit- I might purchase a bigger backpack for school and use this one for something else. I am afraid continuing to stuff this backpack will cause the straps and zipper to rip prematurely!"
4.0,Little large for my wife's wrist . but a good buy
4.0,It feels great! sleeves are a little small tho
4.0,The cup sizes are too small for a XL
4.0,"I absolutely love this bag, the only bad thing about it is that I have had to do a bit of sewing. The thread came out in two spots on the handle. One where the inner piece could have come out and the other was right in the middle of the handle, which I couldn't fix. Otherwise this bag is perfect!"
4.0,Very nice cape
4.0,"After breaking my ring finger and being told by my doctor that it would be a year before I was able to size my wedding ring I found this stretchy ring as my substitute.  It is bigger than I thought and my son laughed at me when I showed him, I believe ""BLING"" was the word he used before laughing.  I've gotten used to the size and it does the trick getting over my swollen knuckle.  I also have no fear about having it stuck and getting it sawed off because it can be broken by hand.  I gave it four star because of the size and I haven't had it that long."
4.0,My sister absolutely loved these
4.0,hard to put together and very bulky but I like how the look when there in
4.0,Very cute. I wear a size 8 and ordered a size 8.
4.0,"I took a star off for being TIGHT! I walk 5 miles a day for exercise. I wanted a sock that reached just high enough to be covered with ankle weights for my walks. The height worked out perfect for that. The problem that I have with these socks is that they are TIGHT! These socks probably come from China and are probably the reason they are so tight. I do have large ankles as a woman and maybe even calves. It's not from fat. My large ankles are from large bones and my calves are mostly muscle. You can see the tightness in my photos and you can see the indented marks in my leg and foot from the sock after coming back from one of my walks. I had hoped that these socks would stretch out some and wouldn't be so tight, but I haven't had that luck. I guess that means they are durable. If you have skinny ankles and chicken legs then these socks are for you. One more note: I wish the top of the sock was a normal cut and not white. I think the cut and white on the top is weird. But like I said, I bought them for the height that I wanted."
4.0,Good deal for the value
4.0,Looks and fits great! Will update my review after I use it at Park City next week.
4.0,"Super soft and super comfy. Nice quality. Runs small, size up!"
4.0,"They did not lift my butt, but they're comfortable. Although, because of the kind of material, they make you sweat a lot. However, they are cute, and camouflage any dimples you might have."
4.0,"I really like this dress. It looks classy and elegant.<br />One disappointing thing is the color. The picture on Amazon looks<br />a bit bronze like, but actually, it's more blue grey and not so shiny.<br />(My own picture also shows the wrong color as the lighting.)<br />I bought size 2 and it fits perfect, however, too long. So I trimmed for 3inches.<br />Overall, I love this dress. Even with the alteration, it's under $100!"
4.0,Just as described. Would have been 5 star but a couple of the bunnies were broken and bent so they were unusable.
4.0,"very nice item, Birthday present for a family member who thinks its very cool item."
4.0,Was a beautiful color and an extra large is a little snug on my friend who wears a 6/8 .
4.0,"This luggage cover appears to be made of a decent material. (Haven't used it yet; but, I will be in 2 weeks!) It is substantial, similar to a thin neoprene, but much more stretchy. The 2-part nylon zipper is extra wide, easy to put together and less likely to get stuck or separate. The design is exactly as it appeared in the description. I purchased the one with the sun and planets; I love it! It also came with an unexpected FREE bonus gift: a metal luggage tag labeled &#34;Mrs.&#34;, which worked fine for me. The only reason I'm giving the cover 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sizing instructions. We have hard-side luggage and I wanted a cover for our 25&#34; suitcase. In the description, if the measurements of your piece of luggage is at the upper range, you are instructed to go up a size if you have hard-side luggage. I did. I ordered a Large. It arrived on time; but, when I put it on the suitcase...it was HUGE!!!  I will be returning it; however, I have already ordered and received another one of the same in a medium, and it's a perfect fit. Just remember that this cover is for luggage with carrying handles on the RIGHT SIDE ONLY. There is NO OPENING in the cover on the left side. The opening on the top is ample and will easily accommodate many sizes of telescoping handles. As for durability, I'll let you know when we return from our vacation."
4.0,"I thought the stones would be alittle larger like it shows in the pic, but over all I like it and i am satisfied"
4.0,"Just as described. Cute and well made. Does not make your hands stink after use.<br /><br />Gloves run a bit small though. I am 5'10"" and have long but skinny hands and these gloves fit tightly all over. I wear a medium latex glove with no problem. These are smaller than that, I think due to the lining.  I would not repurchase, but manageable for quick use."
4.0,A great piece of jewelry at a fair price. Highly recommended.
4.0,Love the color  an how it fits
4.0,"Very cute face scarf, good quality. Will definitely purchase more."
4.0,Very nice shoes but they run quite narrow. Hoping they stretch across the top.
4.0,I did not realize there were that many in the bag.  It gave me plenty for my grand kids and I am also donating a few to a shelter around her.  The fit is right for my 6 year old granddaughter and 8 year old grandson.
4.0,They are great. The buckle was was bigger than l expected.
4.0,"These are nice, good quality metal and the stones look nice/have stayed in place.  They are a little long, but I made them work.  The stone for me was a little small, but I like larger ones."
4.0,I like the colors and was enjoying it. It didn’t irritate my skin like the original Fitbit band. I haven’t had it six months and now the pin that attached the band to the Fitbit has broken!! I won’t be repurchasing!!!
4.0,"These are US sizes...no need to upsize. Roomier than expected but has a lovely drape. Not a dressy top, but nicer with jeans than a plain t shirt. The sleeves are long, which I love having long arms myself. Item washed well and kept its shape."
4.0,I've enjoyed these locks during my travels. They have always worked for me.<br /><br />They are even nice when you want to keep things looked in your bag in the room.<br /><br />It's obvious it wouldn't take much to break them but it does not matter.<br /><br />It would not take anymore effort to break into your bag.
4.0,"Comfy material. I hoped it would've been longer on my torso but it only goes to my natural hip line, so I deducted a star (I'm 5'9&#34;). I love this style so I will be ordering another in grey."
4.0,very nice my wife loves it
4.0,"Lightweight, colorful, small... not exactly the size I wanted.  But fun to carry."
4.0,"This is the second pair of these slippers that I owned and I absolutely love them. They fire very well, provide needed support and very warm (important sitting winter months)<br />The only problem I have with them is that insoles get when out too quickly. My last pair lasted me a little over a year and the lining of them insoles was pretty much gone. I went to the manufacturer's website and could not find replacement I could buy. Next time I'll email customer service.<br />Overall, I worked highly recommend these slippers as they are very comfortable."
4.0,Purchased this so when events require a clear bag I have a cute bag. Haven’t had the chance to use it due to virus but it’s really sturdy and thick. Will update how long it lasts
4.0,looks exactly like the pic good quality
4.0,I need to return for smaller size.  I have wide foot with bunion and didn't need to order the wide either.
4.0,very comfortable but material clings to the body more than i like
4.0,Very pretty. The white is a bit bright but it doesn't take away much from the overall look. I'm pleased.
4.0,"The colors are slightly off from the picture and they're thinner than depicted, but I overall LOVE them! Much better alternative than trying to buy plugs in a store"
4.0,I bought this for my sister for my wedding and it fit her perfect. Only problem was it was kinda see through.
4.0,"Kinda cheap, will have to be careful with them. But with that said, I'm glad to be able to read outside again."
4.0,"Just as pictured, not flimsy, decent thickness and works great!"
4.0,A Fave with 1 exception. The metal flats fall off pretty easy and a few are differently colored-randomly. Lost a few flats just in moving it around.<br />Fits perfect cause it molds to your shape.
4.0,Purchased for my nephew's birthday. Item was a gift but the recipient loved it. He loves all the marvel characters.
4.0,This is a great design and lovely material. The only problem was that i had to add elastic to the outer sides of breast areas as it was too loose for my comfort level. Also i added another layer of material to the breast areas as it was very thin.<br />So if you don't sew or dont want to pay to alter the item it may not be a good idea to purchase.
4.0,"The XL seems like a 2X, but I like it."
4.0,Very pleased with the shirt and service.
4.0,"This is a cute watch for girls/women that looks nice and feels well-made. This watch is very affordable. This is a great watch to wear casually, and looks chic. I like the white color of this watch, the color gives it a vibrant yet calm feel."
4.0,Great dress! I am really sensitive to itchy fabric and this is a little itchy but otherwise a great dress. I get lots of compliments on it!
4.0,These are great and they actually stay on.
4.0,"Sexy little black dress!  I'm about 5'9, 170lbs, my measurements are 38C-27-41, and I ordered the Medium. The dress fit like a glove and has enough stretch to clingto your curves if you want it to!<br /><br />The shoulder part would sometimes ride up and wouldn't stay off shoulder. The split on the bottom was more revealing than expected. Dresses tend to ride up on me, so I'd have to shrug the dress down because the split would be waaay too high on my thigh lol<br /><br />Other than that, the dress was great!"
4.0,"PROS:<br />-Great semi-casual look and feel for  cargo pants, shorts, jeans, etc.<br />-Innovate &#34;no-hole&#34; design means you can adjust the belt down to the millimeter for comfort.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Careful when buckling and unbuckling the belt; you may accidentally tear or pull the basket-weave fiber if snagged by the pin."
4.0,"So Cute, but Smaller than Expected"
4.0,I like the designs in the pack and they fit very well.
4.0,"Absolute favorite piercing. This morning in the shower (about a year after purchasing) the ball either wasn't secured tightly or something, but it ended up rolling down the drain. Until that incident, they're great.<br /><br />No rusting or color fading on the titanium and cz, and they insert/ remove easily"
4.0,"Graphics are real nice, T could be of a little heavier quality. I rate ever T against Harley Davidsons T's which are the finest in quality."
4.0,Very cute! I got one for my 9 yo and had the other in spare which was great bc one day she asked if her best friend could go to the pool with us. I knew it would come in handy! Fit great except the strap on the spagetti strap side was a little long so I had to tie it. No biggie esp considering the awesome price!!
4.0,"I love all the stuff that fits in this carrier. The only draw back is that it isn't super structured (I fixed that easily by placing my hair brush across the top to stablize it, otherwise it would fall back on itself.) The side pockets are wonderful and I like how its smaller than my previous tolietry bag, yet doesn't waste as much space so it fits more stuff. Also the hanging option is great."
4.0,"The description for these boots says they run large, but I find them to be the opposite. They were a bit small, so not very comfortable to me. Since they are not actual leather, they will not stretch, so I don’t think I will be able to wear these. It’s disappointing, since I like the way they look. I suggest you ignore the suggestion to buy a smaller size and order your usual size."
4.0,Make sure you get the next size up
4.0,It is soft and warm.  It is knitted.  I am pleased with this purchase.  I had one surprise with the Pom Pom on top.  You can't see the Pom Pom on the picture.
4.0,"Absolutely NO support for the girls, but the way this suit is made, you can wear a bra that straps around your neck.  I’m in love with this suit.  I like the coverage over my thighs and the sexy yet girly slit up the side."
4.0,"I bought this as a graduation gift for one of my former students who is going on to study sign language and become an interpreter.  I think it's a very pretty bracelet.  It would be nice if more charms could be added, but it makes a great gift."
4.0,"Works decent as a summer cover for arm tattoos, though you can still slightly see my bright colors. Might be because my arms are bigger and material is stretched thin. Also getting black."
4.0,"The bracelets are a nice color and a good size. However, they are NOT stretchy at all. You have to bend the bracelet a bit to get it on and off and I can see that after some time, the metal might break."
4.0,Good product just not good to replace as mask cause material is too thin
4.0,It's a little loose to me
4.0,my has a very small arm and it fit very good
4.0,"I received a much larger belt than I ordered but had no time to return, I simply added holes and mad due.  Otherwise the belt is OK. I had ordered a 43-47 inch and got a 50 inch."
4.0,"Really cute, bends easily."
4.0,"Pleasant enough beads,nicely ethnic looking. Not that special."
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture and it super cute. Only issue is that it does run just a Little on the smaller side and it’s a tad see through. Other than that it’s perfect
4.0,Beautiful quality malla
4.0,"Great shorts with slight padding, I say slight because it's pretty thin. It survived a 40-mile bike ride in the TD 5-boro and it started the get uncomfortable after around 30 miles. None the less, it still serves it's purpose as being a casual cycling short product. Didn't feel the need to wear traditional cycling shorts and these shorts fit the bill. I'm a 36&#34; waist and bought a size large and have no complaints."
4.0,The white Sherpa has a lot if shedding
4.0,were slightly wider/ spread out than expected but seemed to be good quality
4.0,"First, these pants are ADORABLE. Second they fit exactly as I expected, even at 9 months pregnant. They’re very soft, but also very thin. That doesn’t bother me because I run warm anyway. I got these with postpartum time in mind, being at home. I’m very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,Pockets could be deeper.
4.0,"My son chose another pair of boots, but I was pulling for this one.  It looks great and is shockingly light-weight.  Much lighter than any other boot he tried.  He wears a 6.5 sneaker and these fit just fine."
4.0,Beautiful but not for someone under 5'6. Fits beyond oversized.
4.0,i was there was a bigger size as XXL barely fits my foot. comfort and feel ware nice
4.0,Not really happy with the detail design in the leaf but I still enjoy wearing my gold leaf necklace!
4.0,"Very Cute, like a lot but It wasn't mentioned that it fits sort of like a crop top. If you raise your arms your stomach will show. It isn't a bad surprise but just was not expecting it. Good material and it is sort of sheer but in a good way."
4.0,Bought an xlg cut for a size small  so I got it
4.0,Skinny jeans to another level.<br /><br />I kinda hesitate to wear this sometimes cuz they really are skinny and tight. Almost goes against the amount of masculinity i am comfortable with and goes towards women’s jeggings tbh.
4.0,"If you're like me, you looked all over the web for something similar to Target's Merona White boxer brand.  They were excellent, and lasted a long time.  So these are about as close to them as you'll find (at present April 2017).  I've tried others, but either too long, uncomfortable or an odd fit.  These do the job, look half-decently good.  I took a star off because the waistline material could be softer (it's fine- it doesn't actually irritate, but it should be lined with cotton, instead of the stretch material only).  The material is a little bit less thick as the Merona's, but I'll live."
4.0,"Wasn't expecting the polyester fabric and it's kind of shiny, but it fits as expected and is of decent quality for the price."
4.0,The gold on the bee faded super fast and is now just silver. But it's still obviously a bee. And I still love it!
4.0,Ordered a small for my mother-in-law. She loves it. Says it fit as expected. The material is a thin but not see through material.
4.0,Shipping was fast! It looked super tiny when I opened it but it fit me perfect! I ordered a size small and it's very stretchy and breathable and pretty comfy too! I like how it has 3 rows in stead of two! Only real why I didn't give it 5 is because it has no curves at all to the side like my sport trainer did so I'm hoping it'll give me the same curves.
4.0,Very pleased with purchase.  I bought both black and white colors.
4.0,This is a good backless bra. Definitely gives you more cleavage but it not good to wear in the hest where sweat and decrease the sticky ness.
4.0,Very light weight for hot weather
4.0,Queda muy linda.
4.0,Size for Asian have difficulties but nice & good
4.0,Very cousy and comfortable
4.0,"Nice watch, does quite a bit for the money paid. Steps seem accurate and I like how it measures heart rate and blood pressure"
4.0,I ordered the size 9 but got the 10-11 luckily they fit perfectly.  I typically wear a size 9 US.
4.0,"Fits okay but is a bit larger than expected, sometimes they don't stay up all the way. But they are very comfortable. The material can be itchy at times.  I would buy them again but would buy a slightly smaller size maybe."
4.0,"Nice. Simple. Sturdy.  A matte brick red color. Definitely not a bright true red, but worth the $$"
4.0,Looks very nice. Having issues trying to take out links to size it however.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d113a4cb17530f1052b2209292b3c81e]] I have big thighs, so the thigh straps wouldn’t come up where they should but I’m very happy with the product!"
4.0,"I have yet to use it but by all indications it will be just right for international travel having to keep passport, and other things on me whether working or just a passenger on a bus."
4.0,"I bought this last summer. It was pretty cute. Not the best quality, but what do you expect for an inexpensive suit??? I only needed it to last one summer anyway..."
4.0,"I really like this bad, it's sporty and cute, and a decent size. I'm giving it four stars only because I was under the impression that the back zipper pocket was a separate compartment, but it's actually just an alternate zipper that allows you easily access your laptop if it's in the back of your bag. The problem I see with this is if you are somehow robbed/pick-pocketed, this makes it easy to access everything."
4.0,"I have a really small chest and would’ve liked some cushion in the breast part of the dress. Overall, it’s a sexy dress. I loved it!"
4.0,Fits very snug.  Got them for the larger of my two 10 year-old sons who is of average build.  I passed them down to my slimmer 10 year-old.  They are even snug on him but should last him a while.
4.0,"Super stylish, just cut a bit small"
4.0,"Gorgeous top. It is completely see through if you hold it up to a light though. I’m 5’5, dress and pants size 8. Ordered a medium in this top. It’s too tight in my upper arms. I think I’m just broad shouldered in general though. I will be returning, sadly!"
4.0,"Super cute , would of gave it 5 star if there were different sizes."
4.0,"My daughter finished her first year of school (pre-k). Her teacher was very nice, and was also retiring so we wanted to get her a little gift. My daughter had said that she liked flamingos so we decided to get her this broach as a little thank you/retirement gift. The price was decent and it was a little bigger than expected. The quality seemed pretty good, plus it came in a gift box. She ended up thanking us and said she liked it."
4.0,"Tera Armor - 5 Ring Pack Women's Silicone Wedding Ring Band - Pink, Purple, Grey, Blue, White<br /><br />I purchased these because I had recently bought my husband one.  He is a Semi truck driver and is constantly working on parts and I am terrified that he will get his wedding band caught and something happening to his hand.  He has been wearing his silicone band for over a month now and loves it.<br /><br />They are very lightweight and not too bulky.  For a woman's band they are a little wide so I gave them a try for a week.  I did not have any reactions to it but did find that I had to take it off to dry out every night.<br /><br />I received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. Like most people, I rely heavily on product reviews when deciding to purchase an item from a particular manufacturer or company. This increases my performance level as a reviewer and allows me to review a greater number of products, providing more companies, and individuals like yourself, with valuable feedback and product information.

4.0,"Nice blouse, good fit, comfortable."
4.0,This arrived today it's pretty and different not the best workmanship but looks hand made to give it a unique loom
4.0,The brim is smaller than I expected but it’s cute.<br />The color is just as pictured and it is foldable. It doesn’t get damaged despite being in a backpack for a while
4.0,Gave 5 on warmth. But riding my motorcycle in 50 degrees. Not that great. But just wearing them out side there good.  It’s feel like a glove in a glove I don’t like the feel of them on my bike grips. Other than that they’re OK
4.0,"This dress was exactly what I was looking for as far as style and fit! I wore it out to my Bachelorette party and got tons of compliments! The only downside was that there was a pucker in the right neckline and side that made the sequins rub against my arm, but with the reflection of the sequins no one else could tell! Overall it was a really good purchase!"
4.0,"Tank was cute, soft, thin material. Neck comes down low, so best over a swimsuit.<br />XL had a loose, flowy fit."
4.0,Lovely piece for the money!
4.0,"Love the material, style, comfort.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is it is just a bit too large.  I got a small but it is made large.  Not too large not to wear though!!"
4.0,"This is a sturdy bag.  I like that it expands on the sides - but I wish that it would expand all the way up. The neck of the bag stays the same width, so there is no way I can put a water bottle and a notebook into this at the same time."
4.0,"Bought these for my brother who weight lifts everyday. Unfortunately he is extremely picky with what he wears in the gym and these were too thick and warm for him. BUT he wears them multiple times a week at home as lounge shorts. They are great quality, just warm."
4.0,Fit tight at first but the material is so thin that they loosen up just enough. I like the way they are cut they are just a little too thin so couldn't give 5 stars but good socks.
4.0,"Comfortable to wear and offers great support. My regular size is a 9, but feels a little loose in the heal. Maybe could have had a 8 1/2 if available. Otherwise, no other concerns."
4.0,"These are very nice, I absolutely love the size and luster, one pair was not as shiny as the other 2, but still very pretty."
4.0,They look nice. I was  hoping they where a little smaller of a loop but still nice
4.0,Looks great. Giving for a gift.
4.0,Cute but just a tad to small
4.0,"My husband searched for this style for me as he knows that I will love it. I was in love at first sight, the item doesn't look cheap, it smells nice (in my opinion, compared to the ones that I purchased before), you can rock the rainy days in style... BUT, my only problem with this was, it was kind of heavy. Most rain boots ARE heavy but because of the fact that I found one that is super light and much cheaper than this one, I decided to return it. This boots is good for ladies who wouldn't mind the weight. It is super cute, I have to really think hard before actually returning it. I might regret it one day and might decide to buy it again, well see. I will save myself $49 for now."
4.0,I got this today and I love it. I gave it 4 stars because I wish the arms were more fitted. But I’m 5’2 120 lbs and small fits
4.0,Wore under dress for dance
4.0,buena calidad un poco difícil de abrochar
4.0,Needs to make sure the color is consistent
4.0,Finally something online that looks like the picture...Good product for the price! Fits good and can be dressed up or down!!
4.0,Nice dress wish i had ordered a size smaller but love it wore it for easter.
4.0,beautiful dress just a little baggy overall. love the cut
4.0,"Good quality and cute earrings, however they were a lot larger than I expected."
4.0,Thicker than most. Looks like it will stand up to many washes. It is not as soft as a result but still comfortable.  The small is very small and would be too tight for adult men.  Fits a teen perfect
4.0,"Customer service was great. The product arrived quickly and was easy to adjust to my body. I have a chest style freezer and it's very easy to put the whole vest laying flat on one side. It's easy to wear and while I do feel the cold it's not unbearable. The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is I wish I didn't have to wear it for two hours a day. Although I have still seen results with less time, I think one hour twice a day is what is suggested. All in all it's a great product and does what they say."
4.0,"These glasses are SO cute, but, they are huge!  I love oversized glasses but I won’t be able to wear these actually doing anything bc they constantly slide off my face..  they’re super cute so I’ll just deal and wear them when/where I’m able!"
4.0,I'm 5'1&#34; and it's the perfect length and size. The fabric is very comfortable and colorful.
4.0,"Lightweight and cute, but MUCH lighter than pictured and what I wanted. I bought to match with some bracelets and it won’t, but I’ll still keep as the price was okay."
4.0,"This pants are great for looks but if you're looking for a really comfy workout pant or are self conscious I would suggest passing on these. While I really like them and don't mind how form-fitting they are, they are probably not the best if you really need to move or are really self conscious about your thighs or bottom."
4.0,Very cute keychain. I was a little disappointed the one I got did not have more of Areial on it.
4.0,This case is great. Deep enough so the analog sticks are protected too and won't get pressed or anything while the case is closed and even with accessories in the storage pocket. The only reason I didn't give this case that last star is it need some sort of lift strap to help get the switch out. Since it is a deeper case you have to kind of wedge a finger between the switch and the case to pull it out.
4.0,"Super cute hat, I am going to use it at the pool today for the first time!"
4.0,I really like the quality of the necklace
4.0,"A word of caution, these studs have a very sharp end so have to be really careful putting them in. I use for my helix piercing, it doesn't come loose when i sleep on it which is a plus. It lost a star only because I expected it to be more on the clear side but it's white. Its not very attractive but it will do cause I have to wear on my job."
4.0,"I have worn this belt multiple times and think it is perfect for cinching tunics or dresses. One thing I did not realize when I ordered: the brown braid is only in the front. The rest of the belt is just plain stretchy brown elastic. At 5'5 120# I normally wear a size 2. I originally ordered the small. While I could wear it, it was a little too snug for me to be comfortable. I returned it (no hassle) and reordered the medium. This one fits great. I am guessing the medium is good for up to a size 6, as it is a little roomy on me."
4.0,"The necklace is very dainty, the charm is a little bigger than a mustard seed but I love it 😊 hopefully it won't break. . I've only had it for 1 day."
4.0,"This dress is adorable! I normally wear a large, but after previous issues with clothing from China, I opted for the 2xl. It fits perfectly and looks great. As long as you order up you'll be very happy. I can't wait for Christmas!"
4.0,This top is so versatile and sharp. It is very flattering to my figure!!! I would recommend this item and will be ordering in other colors if they become available. Great wardrobe investment.
4.0,They fit and feels perfect
4.0,Very nice. Gave as gifts to my parents
4.0,My wife lives rhem
4.0,Love the light blue and gray combo. The pic used to advertise it has the peach color on the bottom hidden. It would have been sooo much cuter with just the two colors. It is comfortable! Just disappointed in the color
4.0,Not for walking around.
4.0,I like these.  They are nice and seem well made.
4.0,Its a really nice costume although I should have ordered it in tall it fit really nicely. The only problem I had was after I wore it for the first time I had an allergic reaction. Nothing to serious it might be fine after its washed.
4.0,"Wasn't quite sure what to expect because I had never used support socks before, but now that I have tried them I will say there is a learning curve to putting them on. They are very tight but then again that is what they are suppose to be in order to provide the necessary support. They are comfortable and able to be worn for extended periods of time right from the beginning."
4.0,"Used this for a Halloween party.  Considering the complaints I other reviewers had about the heat of the mask, I opted to use makeup instead.  However, the mask is very well made and would have been very useful if I didn't have the time for the makeup.  The costume ended up being a pretty big hit, winning me the costume contest almost unanimously.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at how NOT wrinkled everything was.  The pieces unpackaged nicely and required no extra effort to get presentable.<br /><br />My only real complaint was that the jacket was too small and the front ended above my waistline (6'0&#34;&#34;, 34&#34; waistline).  Also, the white shirt included with the costume is actually just a white bib.  Hesitant to risk letting my skin peak through, I opted for a white T-shirt instead and it worked out just fine considering how busy the rest of the costume is."
4.0,These are the cutest pajamas ever. The material is soft and a little stretchy. I would order a size larger if you like a little looser fit. I am ordering another pair in a larger size
4.0,"Nice durable band. The picture shows a free rubber piece to go over the watch piece, this I did not receive. Other then that great watch band."
4.0,For the price these are surprisingly substantial (not too heavy) and hang well. So far they have not &#34;turned&#34; any off color.
4.0,absolutely love them. except the back one broke after about 1- 1 1/2 months and the white broke after ab 4 months. all bracelets like this are fragile:/
4.0,"I ordered a small and a medium. I am 5’4” 118lbs and I typically wear a size 0 / small, but dresses are tough since I measure a 32DDD in chest. The dresses both fit great actually, but both were a little long for my taste, hitting mid knee. What I don’t understand is why the medium was a much nicer quality than the small. Thicker material and made much better overall. I would have kept the small and returned the medium if it were not for this. But there was a HUGE difference in quality between the 2 so I am returning the small and got the medium hemmed up 2 inches."
4.0,"The shoes run small and are tight on the toes,  i am breaking them in with use but I could've done with a half size up"
4.0,"Nice jacket but runs very small ,i got a 2x for my daughter and it fit her just right ,so make sure you buy at least 2 sizes bigger."
4.0,"im disappointed on the shape of the shirt of u look at the pic it seems to angle in on the sides and i no its not pleated in the front but the way the shirt in the pic is hanging looks nice , feminine ,no doesnt hang like that. the only thing i like about the top is the colirs but thier not the colirs ir PATTERN i ordered ill be returning it its not worth the money"
4.0,"Very cute jumper, gets lots of compliments. However, after one wash it shrunk so much it was no longer<br />wearable. The jumper is also not practical if your child is still in diapers (there are no buttons at bottom)."
4.0,Good quality for the price however with the filters it’s pretty hard to breathe.
4.0,Definately cute shirt! Thinner material than what I expected but I still really like it. I am 5'4 125lbs I ordered a small. Fits great! Loose fitting but not too loose. Would definitely recommend especially for the price.
4.0,Super cute swimsuit! Sadly it was a bit big on my bust which was pretty much expected. Everything else fit PERFECT!
4.0,"Love love love this shirt!  Fits fantastic,  would have been a 5 star but I had to move the straps over a little bit. Received tons of compliments"
4.0,5' 4&#34;- 118 lbs. Runs small so order a size up. I always wear a small but medium fits perfect.
4.0,"Cute skirt look with a very flattering fit. Sized as expected. Comfortable and cool with great ease of movement, and I loved the b&w daisy print. I would've preferred a side-seam outer pocket to the pockets on the rather flimsy mesh shorts, which are smallish and on the outer thigh. I would never trust my phone or anything important in one of those pockets. Also, I've had some issues with one of the short legs crawling up my thigh and bunching up for some reason. The mesh material is very light and loose, which makes me suspect I'll need to be careful laundering this garment if I want it to hold up. Overall, I very much like the look and feel, and if it holds up well enough, and I see myself buying more colors."
4.0,"I thought of trying this out mostly because the original silicone band that came with the watch was either too tight or too loose as well as it gave me some skin irritation around the wrist and also left some scarring around my wrist. So far I really like this nylon band. It definitely solves most of the issues that I had with the original band. The only thing I didn't like about this was the tools, otherwise it is a great band."
4.0,"They are so adorably printed, but unfortunately I think my skull is a bit too big because they keep trying to slide up off my head.  I have to end up using like 8 bobby pins just to secure it.  I am willing to do that, I just wish I didn't have to"
4.0,"I was hoping for a more fitted look than I got, but it's still cute. If I order another I will go down a size."
4.0,We made our son wear a “real watch” before getting a knock off fit bit. It helped us teach him the concept of time and telling time and was cool
4.0,"I got the  &#34;Donna&#34; pair, they were darker than expected but still very cute"
4.0,"I like the shirt, but t's too long. I'm 5'10&#34; and it goes past my butt. I was hoping it would hit mid hip, instead of 5 inches lower.<br />Also, i ordered this shirt in three colors and they sent three of the same color necklace. That was disappointing."
4.0,"Our rescue 6-7 month old pup was incredibly quiet and often managed to disappear from beside us. The bells announce her movements in the house and in the yard, so we can intervene before she gets into trouble."
4.0,The fabric is nice and it's a cute dress. It is comfortable on. I did end up returning it because the style was not suited for my body type.
4.0,I really love the look and feel of this one. It has a casual but classy look and looks even better on (per my wife). I did feel that the sleeves were slightly short (about an inch) and the length was also a bit short (1-2 inches) versus others of the same size.<br /><br />I did not have any issues with fading or any fabric coming loose after washing (this is after several washes). I would definitely buy this again if it comes in other colors.
4.0,Great suit however be sure to use sellers size chart rather than Amazon's.
4.0,One came broken but I was able to fix with patience
4.0,Not made for someone with larger cup sizes.
4.0,Cute. I wear a XS-S in regular clothes and I got a large! Make sure you size up. The ink on the letter are a little smudged. At least it’s super soft!
4.0,Slightly sheer in the chest so if ur bust is larger it will sheer out other than that it's a great dress super long def dusts tops of feet. I got a size XL because my boobs r big
4.0,"A little larger than I expected, but will still wear it because it's pretty comfortable otherwise."
4.0,"I know I shouldn't have a very high expectation when getting a pair of boots for this low of a price. I've worn them about 15 times or so and the fabric on the heels are starting to rip off. Very sad because these boots are very cute and a perfect length! They fit is as expected, so I wouldn't recommend ordering a size up or down."
4.0,"The dress is cute. It is lightweight. It has a thin, white material liner on the inside of the dress.<br />I am 5'7&#34; and with 150lbs. I usually wear a size 8 or size 10 in clothing. I ordered a dress size large. The dress is comfortably loose in my caboose and I like the overall roomy fit. This is why I went with the dress size large. I was also afraid the dress might shrink after washing too. The hem hits 2.5-3 inches above my knee cap.<br /><br />Two things I do not like about this dress (and the reasons for the 4-star rating):<br />1. The underarm area is big. The seams stick out on the sides under my arms. This is okay if my arms are down. If I raise my arms, however, one will see the material sticking outward. I don't know if the size medium would fit better in this area or if the material will shrink.<br /><br />2. The ruffles do lay upwards at all times. It tickles my neck. It is kind of annoying. The ruffled collar cannot be turned downward."
4.0,a little long but it fits really good. I bought small and i am 4”11” long.
4.0,Only giving four stars because the backpack opening is smaller than I was hoping for. But it holds a lot nonetheless.
4.0,"I am 5'2 and 118 pounds. The jacket fit fine. Pants were a bit too long, but it's ok.. I love the quality of this .. I have no regrets!<br />Only gave 4 stars because I have to i'll have to pay to get them hemmed . but it's alright, I've ordered another already"
4.0,Great vest for the money
4.0,Other than the smallish waist pockets & the asian sizing even smaller than advertised with 1 saze added
4.0,"I ordered this in a large, however, it fits more like a medium.  I would recommend ordering one size up.<br />It is 97% polyester and the exterior is very satiny.  The inside is a little rough though and I did not find it comfortable to wear alone, however, it is very nice to wear with nightgowns and lingerie.  The robe hangs to just above the knee and the sleeves hit right at the elbows.<br />The robe is very well constructed and the coloring is consistent throughout.  The robe only closes with the removable coordinating sash tie, there are no inner ties to help keep it closed.  The polyester material should last for a long time and many washes.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
4.0,I absolutely love the conservative style I feel comfortable and to say the least modest.  The need to cover up is reduced to minimum.
4.0,"Very pretty dress. I'm 5'5"" 130 lbs and ordered a medium. Fits great."
4.0,"Not a bad mask at all, I will recommend it. I only gave 4 stars because the earlobe was falling off, it was just too big and not adjustable. That's something they need to change so it can be adjustable. Alot of ppl loved."
4.0,I love the compliments I get when wearing this dress. It’s simple enough to wear for casual events and also can be dressed up a bit too. Love it
4.0,"Positives:<br />-Extremely cute.<br />-Easy to put on.<br />-Appear to be well built. My daughter was unfortunately unable to wear them.<br />Negatives:<br />- They run small. My daughter wears a toddler 9. These are Toddler 9 and they are in fact too small. Order one size up.<br />Other thoughts:<br />Took a comparison picture next to size 9 sneakers, against a wall for reference."
4.0,"Cute, but the quality isn’t great. If you’re going to order this item, it runs large so go a size down. It’s not a bad item, it just didn’t fit me correctly. There’s nothing essentially wrong with the product, the quality could be better, but it is a cute dress, just not for me."
4.0,They are comfy but make sure you order them 3 sizes larger than normal. They are Asian sized.
4.0,Very cute and slim
4.0,Great product.just a little shorter than I like.
4.0,Nice boots but a little too narrow for my wide feet.
4.0,Decent GMT watch for the money
4.0,These may break easily but so far so good. Have worn a few times and no issues.
4.0,"this bracelet is really gorgeous, it was listed in Men's bracelets, but it's small enough for my wrist. I get tons of compliments every time I wear it. My friends think I spent $75!!! Only negative aspect is the clasp, but it's the only part that feels &#34;cheap&#34;. It was definitely worth<br />the wait to receive it!!!"
4.0,Fit's like a glove!!! Love it
4.0,"I just received this, it seems good quality and light enough to be quick-dry. It fits perfectly (orange print size Large) and looks good, however I do find the top a bit difficult to get on & off."
4.0,Bought these for my GF she loved them but beware that the others are correct they do size small. But I can't say that I minded that
4.0,"The material is more on the cheap side but still is a pretty dress and not too expensive so I can’t complain. Came pretty quickly as well (last minute dress shopping for a wedding lol) Looks like the picture (but comes wrinkly so will definitely need to iron it)!<br /><br />I’m 5’3’’ (ish), around 215 pounds, large chested (38F), and have hips for days lol. Usually am a size 16 but sized up to an 18 to be on the safe side! Fit great around chest! A little loose around under boob area, but can’t complain! Was also long for me (but that’s because I’m short lol)!"
4.0,"While the coat is stylish and very beautifully made, mine came missing with one front button<br />And the coat is a a lot more marroon then it is red like dantes jacket."
4.0,Easy to attach.
4.0,"Great costume piece, great deal."
4.0,"I generally like this band. The leather has softened up nicely after a week of so of daily use. The color is good and hardware seems durable.<br /><br />Negatives? Well, the lugs are a bit finicky to get in and out of the Watch. Unlike Apple's first party bands and a lot of the 3rd party ones I've bought, these tend to get stuck and require more than a little force to attach and remove. Fortunately, I've not noticed any damage to the Watch itself or to the band. So a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />I can recommend this band."
4.0,"I purchased these gloves three months ago in the spring time. I wear them two or three times a week.  I like the fact that they were bright green and without vendor logos. However, the lime green color has faded significantly and the back of the gloves are tattered and frayed."
4.0,"A cute addition to my grand-daughters bracelet...colorful, shiney and a wonderful size...I know she will love the charm,,,as well as the entire bracelet....."
4.0,Great product. Sometimes a little uncomfortable
4.0,"Nothing off the charts here, and nothing to complain about. If you want some saddle soap to clean up your leather (shoes in my case) this one will serve the purpose. I would recommend this product."
4.0,"only slightly smaller than i was expecting, still totally wearable and the material is nicer than i was expecting as well."
4.0,quite semi elegant
4.0,"Really cute, but run small. More for a child under 4."
4.0,"These were super fun! I'd wear them to raves and for goofing off around the house. They came apart a few times, but I was able to put them back together. Then, one fateful day, they came apart and I wasn't able to fix them. They had a long life and I was really active while wearing them, so they're definitely a good buy if you wanna be stylish ;)"
4.0,Ruffles a little squished in transit. Could also use a slightly bigger pin to put on. But it worked and stayed together. The MOB and MOG both loved and appreciated it.
4.0,Read other reviews before purchasing. It’s a bit larger than I would like. I would say size down as it’s pretty baggy. Very comfortable! Would buy again or for a friend
4.0,"I wanted a pair of water shoes that fully covered the foot for my 1 year old to wear during our trip to the beach.  These worked great!  I purchased the 6-12 month size and they fit her perfectly.  The elastic was snug but not too tight and I did not notice sand go into the shoes the entire time we were there.  It was really helpful to have these because I didn't have to worry about the sand being too hot on her feet or re-applying sun screen to her feet.  They did show some signs of wear after the week (some slight thread fraying, mostly), but I only needed them to last a week and she has since outgrown them.  I can't speak to how well they would hold up to a whole summer of use."
4.0,"It's very cute but I thought it was a real coat, it's more of a jacket, not thick imo it's just as thick as a sweatshirt.  We needed a coat for baby during cold winters this is too thin for 30 degree winters but it's cute and shipped from so far, we'll keep it and use on warmer days."
4.0,"Cute and about what you'd expect from a $30 costume! Definitely size up not a lot of stretch in the bodysuit, it ended up not fitting me unfortunately because of boobs and wide shoulders. If you get the right size worth the money!"
4.0,"Super cute and nice light material, but runs large! I got the 4T and 5T to try for my 4.5 year old who is squarely in 5T or girls XS. The 4T was still way too big, it came almost to her knees and had a good 4 or more inches extra in the crotch area. I ordered another size down to a 3T and it fits perfectly, even though she's about 42 inches tall and about 42 lbs. Photo is the 3T."
4.0,I revised my review since I ordered some other cheaper version.  This crystal definitely looks much better than the cheap plastic looking one.
4.0,Using the waist size chart rather than the tag size I got a perfect fit.  I have a 32&#34; waist and these are great fit.  Haven't swam in them yet but they seem to be well made.
4.0,I like it gave it o Granddaughter as it was too small for my wrist.
4.0,Super cute and comfortable. I didn’t wear a bra with mine either
4.0,"The arm-holes are lower than expected for a woman's shirt (e.g., you can see side-bra), but will make a cute work-out top with a sports bra."
4.0,"Fits my Samsung Galaxy gear s2 band, but does slide off frequently while doing laundry or kitchen work. I haven't tried using more than one at once but that might help."
4.0,"Dress is very pretty.  Bright colors. Material is very soft, however, waist is a little tight for the size.  I usually wear a L but order an XL.  I can still wear the dress if I pull waist up a little.  Works fine!"
4.0,Love it although it's a little bit large but that's ok.
4.0,"The is a well constructed wrap.  The seam are strong and I believe it will be durable over time.  My only critique is that it has not stretch or give in the fabric that makes using this for not only ""fashion"" but practically to lay down Black natural hair."
4.0,Llegó en tiempo y la quedo muy bn
4.0,"Super cute bag. Its very large, perfect for traveling. Love the color as well(coffee), looks just like the picture. As I read the reviews for this bag I was torn because some mentioned a fishy smell and some did not. Sure enough, the inside of this bag REEKS. Super disappointed, but I'm sure it will fade out eventually...that really should not be a problem when buying a purse and I can't wrap my head around not why it is."
4.0,"Love the adjustable straps, the style and fit bit it does run a little big in the chest but not bad. It still looks good. The skirt part is a little on the thin side/ see through but can’t tell when on."
4.0,Multi-layers get tangled rather quickly. I still like the necklace
4.0,these pants definitely showed of my curves and i love the design of these jeans. if you like boot cut jeans then these would be perfect for you to purchase.
4.0,"I love this 2 piece set! I read the reviews and got a size up & it fits perfect! The jacket is almost a crop top jacket, showing just a little bit of mid drift. The sleeves are sheer so you have to put it on gently because it's not made of a real thick material. I can't wait to wear this!"
4.0,I like the size of the face of the pin.  It's easy to read.
4.0,If you’re on the bigger side then I’d say you wouldn’t need to up the size of this shirt. Even tho the fit is weird it’s actually really really comfortable and feels good on the skin.
4.0,I have been wearing bandanas under my scrub caps and bouffants and wanted something similar that wasn't a bouffant. The reasons I like this cap: cute designs; comfortable with a sewed in cloth that sits on the forehead (hopefully no breakouts); ties easily; big enough to keep all of my hair in but not too big it gives me cone head. Make sure to handwash and air dry!<br /><br />Haven't found any cons so far.
4.0,"it's kind of strong when it pins up against your ear. If you wear them for too long, it leaves redness"
4.0,"I got mine today and all of them was the same material, they are very soft and feel comfortable. None of them had damage, I would recommend these."
4.0,Comfortable & fit as expected. It lost a star because I feel it could have had a little better support underbust with no discomfort. It was perfect initially but the support didn't hold up to a couple of washes. However it's still good under tees & I will order again in the black.
4.0,"Great for the whole fam!<br />My kids hate wearing the masks at school, these are much better they say! More comfy and still breathable. Plus I think they look better..<br />My 6 year old, 9 year old , 16 year old and my husband all got at least one of these each with this pack and they really like them. One of the stitching came undone already after a few wears but that was my youngest he probably had something to do with it. (Pulling on it a lot maybe)<br />Perfect and great price! Would buy from again!"
4.0,My son bought this for his Girlfriend and she loved it.
4.0,Material is not ripstop like I thought it would be.  Let's see if they hold out.
4.0,Good looking t-shirt. Fit my fiancee well thanks÷
4.0,Lovely dress and good quality. I normally wear size large in dresses however I ordered XL for some strange reason and it fits perfectly....
4.0,I’ve only worn them once. I like them so far. About them to match my necklace I recently received.
4.0,Great shoe. Used it at the river and it kept my sons feet comfortable. Got a lil rash at the heel but to be expected.
4.0,"Really cute and good quality but a little bigger than I wanted for a kids size. It fits adults, more than a 6 year old face."
4.0,"Top fits well, bottom is a little snug but acceptable. I'd buy again in another color."
4.0,"I ordered a medium, it fits perfect which I wanted more of a loose fit. I will keep it and order me another one in a large, very comfortable, soft material looks cute with shorts, capris or leggings."
4.0,Comfortable and attractive; who could ask for more?
4.0,"Beautiful, bright colors however, the torso is a little short.  I am only 5 ft tall but it is still short on me.  Good quality and colors though!"
4.0,"I hate the bad sizing from La Sportiva, sometimes is L sometimes es M sometimes you don’t have any idea!!!"
4.0,Updating my review...first time I ordered I had to send back because it broke right when I got it and it was squished. I ordered again and it looks like they changed the packaging which was good! It wasn't squished or anything it came perfect.
4.0,Nice haven't turned colors and had em for months!! They just never seemed REAL though.<br />But they are cute though and people aren't exaggerating about the post being too thick.  I've worn earrings since a baby.  I'm a hoop addict since middle school and these HURT going into my ears.
4.0,Better than expected....very comfortable
4.0,Dress was even prettier in person
4.0,"So soft, great medium weight. Color as pictured.<br />Sadly, didn’t have correct size so couldn’t get a pic of a good fitting picture."
4.0,I bought these for my husband because they were on sale. I got two pairs for around $5.00. Can't beat that price!!! I am giving them 4 stars because I don't know how they will hold up being so cheap in price. He hasn't worn them yet. The colors and style were very nice. Our school colors are black and yellow so the yellow will be nice during the school year.
4.0,"I gave this as a shower gift, so the older brother didn't feel left out. He loved it."
4.0,"AS a Dane, gave them as gift to my son. Helikes them."
4.0,This is suitable for small to medium sized eye-glass frames.<br />Extra large frames won't fit inside.<br />It's a tight fit. I wish this were longer.
4.0,"Quite heavy, but works for me<br /><br />I bought it the second time in July 2017 :)"
4.0,LOVE THESE!! They look exactly like the picture. The only reason why they weren't 5 stars is because the sides are a little wide. They're definitely unisex... Probably better suited for a males face
4.0,Looks great on my Asus Zenwatch2 watch.
4.0,Great dress very comfortable while being attractive.
4.0,1 size fits all makes for it to run kind if large on me. Usually im a size medium so this is rather large on me. But with a swim suit underneath it works perfect for days by the water
4.0,Kinda tight around the shoulders and sleeves. love the color😊
4.0,I was a little disappointed in the size for my wrist.
4.0,Good product but charms change colors after a few uses.
4.0,"Great price for quality of items. A decent weight of polar style fleece. The beenie fits my fat head good enough to cover my ears. The neck gaiter is super soft and big enough to cover my fat 18+ inch neck. It’s not a wind resistant fleece material though, but it’s still warmer than the blaze orange buff rip off I have been wearing I bought for nearly the same price at academy sports!"
4.0,"The waist is small and the zipper is plastic, it burst at the first wear"
4.0,"Love the dress! I got tons of compliments. But expect to buy boob tape! I sized down since the bodysuit first better. I’m 5”6,140lbs athletic build and I ended up getting a small"
4.0,My boyfriend bought these bracelets for our first valentines day...we are happy!!! Looks nice and they feel good. Btw ... I LOVE YOU HONEY!
4.0,"Dress is very pretty, soft, and slightly stretchy so it would be a good fit if the sizes were more accurate.  Apparently 4 and 6 are considered a size Small and therefore the same size?  I'm short and curvy, but the size 6 I received was about 2 inches too large in the waist.  Shoulders were a tad big, but not terrible.  Length is below the knee, sleeves 3/4.<br /><br />I just would've liked to get the size I ordered.  I think it would've been perfect."
4.0,These are firstly very inexpensive glasses and they feel like it. When you wear them - you cannot tell the quality but holding in hands they do feel cheap. The design is fun with cognac tinted lens and ornate design on the metal frame. My glasses came In brand new with slight tarnishing around the frame - which makes me think that they will not last long. The shape is fairly flattering and I believe it would fit most face shapes. They came in a carrying case to protect glasses when not worn. Overall I think you get what you pay for - this is something great to take on vacation and not worry if they get lost or broken.
4.0,Beautiful color & beautiful overall bootie. Perfect heel. They were just too small.
4.0,"I think they would have been comfy if I had ordered the correct size, but they were small for the size I ordered, so had to return them.:("
4.0,"Handy, dandy little purse organizer. My only complaint is I would like for it to be a little longer. Three pockects instead of two. But it does do what it is supposed to do and that is provide a little more organization for your handbag. Small but usefull."
4.0,Looks cute and not too expensive. I'm satisfied.
4.0,nice quality. lasted a long time before the face peeled off. :(
4.0,"but it works for me, with the pants i'm wearing with it, it works for me."
4.0,was happy with product
4.0,"Was super excited to get this. However, the zipper was broken. It is adorable and is true to size for me. I had to return and I am disappointed. THe dress does need to be washed as it does bleed denim color all over. Very sexy and adorable. Too bad the zipper was broken. :-("
4.0,"Beautiful fabric and color! I just wish the waist band had a tad more stretch to it. I normally wear these types of skirt in a XL but for this brand, the XL was too big and the L was too small."
4.0,"I am 5'3, 32B, 112 lbs and have a shorter torso.  I ordered a small and when I opened the bag (that was labeled small) it was a size 40 which is a medium, according to the mfg. tag.  It was too big, so I sent it back and reordered it.  I opened the bag that was labeled small, again, size 40... If you need a small, you won't get it.  The suit is really cute and well made but I just can't seem to get it in the right size. Gave up and bought a different suit."
4.0,Pretty damn good on the style and fitts well you can purchase your exact size noted these are skinnys.
4.0,Cute! Just like the picture!
4.0,It's really comfortable and delivery is way faster then Amazon shows
4.0,"It's a very nice, well-made item of clothing with surprisingly thick material for the price. However, as mentioned by another reviewer, it is quite snug at the waist.Every other part of it was fine but the waist was just too small...."
4.0,Not as soft as advertised. Great for outside. Easy to clean. Look trendy
4.0,Warm material.
4.0,So far I'm very pleased with the look and durability of these boots. I've only worn them for a week at work but they have protected my feet from below freezing temperatures and manholes with over a foot of water in them.
4.0,like the watch had it since last year still works great only one issue wish the date dial was larger but i over look that i will buy more from this company and actually looking for a new one real soon
4.0,Wallet seems like it's very good quality and durable with the exception of the change pouch which ripped open in less than two weeks
4.0,"Not crazy about the material but it is a nice vibrant pink, fits well, and also looks nice when wearing it."
4.0,Pretty good selection! I like the variety and the price.
4.0,Comforable nice price
4.0,"It's all gorgeous. However, mine's was a little dull in the color, but still beautiful nonetheless."
4.0,"I bought these for the winter as I recently moved from the desert, to the city in California. I was impressed by the quality, they're very warm but after some use they felt kinda thin. Maybe the linen material moved? I don't know; they were bigger than I expected as I am 6'3 and have rather large hands. Which was surprising to me to say the least. But they're good for a fashion statement."
4.0,"A friend of mine bought the exact same wallet from another company and he paid $100! I would recommend buying this wallet and carrying it for 6-8 months. If you love it then perhaps an upgrade makes sense. Then, you could hand this one down to a friend and let them take it out for a spin."
4.0,These have pockets on both sides which I somehow missed! Lol These are great workout leggings and are incredibly comfortable. Also squat proof which is something I always worry about when ordering leggings online. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is they tend to travel around a bit on me but I think I could have sized down. I ordered a medium and I am 5'6 133lb.
4.0,"Very boxy, and hot material."
4.0,"They look nice, feel good on, but are not flashy.  If you like stud earrings, you will like these.  They will go with everything."
4.0,It was supposed to be burgundy not red. Its a dark red . Love it so I am keeping it.
4.0,Cute shirt and comfy but sleeves are too short
4.0,I was really impressed with my new belt after it arrived in the mail. And it wasn't faux leather. it was genuine leather which is a good thing. The color was good too. I am happy with it.
4.0,"The charging cord was a surprise to us too- but it didn't bother my son- you just have to make sure it is on top of the tongue. I do like that the flashing could be turned off. And he liked that he could change it all different colors.<br /><br />Good shoes overall. I docked one star because the velcro wore out really fast- I kept having to glue it back on. It's now so worn out that it doesn't stay fastened, so I guess it's time for us to get him some new shoes. I would have liked them to last a little longer- they aren't too small for him yet and are otherwise still in good condition."
4.0,"All good except mittens, mittens size runs small remaining all good"
4.0,"It is well made, but for me it was a bit too tight on top leaving an indentation ring around my leg.  I was disappointed.  I do not have big legs, but was too small."
4.0,"If you are a size 9 or 9 1/2 in male, this boots will fit you well. I bought this for my son's cosplay costume. It fits perfect with the costume and they are very comfortable for him to wear."
4.0,Love this! Very cute. Just wish it had at least a button or something to keep the ID from falling out.
4.0,Very colorful - Beautiful! Arrived on time great value!
4.0,"My son likes them.  Pricey, but come Christmas time we tend to splurge on these for him."
4.0,"I thought I had already reviewed this product, but I guess not.  OK, first let me start by saying the quality of these glasses is excellent and the communication with the company is fast and very response and helpful.  These were a surprise gift for my husband from the family (myself, kids and grandsons).  He was very touched by it.  Unfortunately, they did  not work for him.  He could only see a slight difference in the brightness of some colors, but it wasn't enough of a change for the price.  Our colorblind grandson also tried them on and did not notice anything either, but that may be because he is 7 years old.  HOWEVER, I did not want to give these glasses a low rating just because they did not work for us. They work for LOTS of other people so give them a try.  With their 60 day money back guarantee if the glasses are still in good condition you cannot go wrong.  My husband has a severe case of color blindness so he only had a small percentage of a chance they would work for him.  That's not a reason for a low rating for the company.  I would recommend anyone wanting to see colors like they should be seen give them a try.  You might be one of the lucky ones.  :-)"
4.0,These gloves are soft and warm. The touch screen part works perfectly. They are a little snug at first but not uncomfortable.
4.0,Cute! My daughter loves this necklace.  The chain would be better if it was a little longer.
4.0,"It’s a super cute swimsuit, but it smells terrible despite multiple washings."
4.0,These are very comfortable and stay in place while working out. They allow breathing while doing cardio without being sucked into your face with inhalation. Not sure how well it blocks out the coronavirus but this is by far the most comfortable mask I have used to workout in.
4.0,Love the look and feel of these.  While shorts fit a bit big I ordered up a size as I have a larger bust.  Top was a bit tight and can see through.
4.0,"Do really like these titanium 6mm hoops, esp the click close for nose piercings. Glad they came in a 2 pk tho, one closes very tightly with no issues but the other one came out of my eyebrow piercing in 2 days time so idk if that one was just a dud. My fault in sizing- my nose is extremely small & for the tight fit I'm looking for I realized after I got this I need a 5mm & really wish this co made one that size in titanium since I can't use stainless. Found ano co that does offer one but I prefer this one for how tightly it closes & stays closed, well at least the one does."
4.0,Material deels like fake plastic.
4.0,"I'd say the shirt is generous; running large to size.  The sleeves went below my elbows!  (I'm having them shortened.)  Next time, I'll order my normal size.  The sizing chart was from Amazon and not  Tri Mountain.  I'd say the Tri-Mountain sizing chart (if there is one) might give a more accurate assessment of the sizing.  Nice weight fabric; well made."
4.0,Most of my reading material is on my iPad.  These clipons are perfect for reading at night.
4.0,This shoe is amazing. I have arthritis in my feet and walking in most shoes is painful but these are amazing. I would say they run just a little big. They will be perfect for around the house but maybe not for a lot of walking because my foot occasionally comes out. I don’t think it’s enough of a difference to size down though. I went ahead and bought another pair that have the full back and I love them
4.0,"Little larger than I would have liked, which makes it slightly cheesy looking."
4.0,I like that it held all of our important paperwork and cards and money. It is a little big but does the job to keep everything together.
4.0,"Definitely small for a 34C but the design is great and although snug, fits comfortably."
4.0,"These are made for kids or smaller, thinner people.  I am male of average height and build (5'10"" tall, 50"" chest, 40"" waist) and 3X fits like a compression shirt.  The poly material seems to be of decent quality and print is colorful and nice.  To be fair the sizing said it runs small and to size up.  Unfortunately, this was the largest size available and the shirt is unwearable due to small proportions."
4.0,"It was a little pricey, but overall I really liked it. It's really cool."
4.0,"I don't know how the manufacturer could package this hat without creating such hard-to-remove creases in its brim. Roll it up perhaps? I dislike the folds, and since it's not supposed to be ironed I'm not sure how to get rid of them. Maybe a fabric steamer would work but I don't have one, and the seller provides no suggestions for how to get rid of the creases. Instead they seem to promote the hat's ability to fold as an advantage -- but to me the folds are undesirable, yet that's what you get with this hat.<br /><br />Fortunately the brim is thick enough to avoid the floppiness of two of my other hats. Those hats drive me nuts when their brims constantly flop down into my eyesight and get in the way of my view when I'm trying to accomplish something. I do not think this hat will do the same thing because its brim is much thicker, so this is a good thing!<br /><br />I get the feeling that this hat will do a tremendous job of preventing the sun from hitting my face, neck, ears, etc. Then maybe I won't have to put sunscreen on all these parts, especially when I'm only going to be out in the sun for a short time.<br /><br />The so-called ""sweat band"" doesn't do much, so if you sweat a lot you may want to wear something beneath this hat to soak it up. I haven't used this hat in really hot weather yet so I don't know how cool it's going to feel. I've never had a hat that ventilates well in the hot sun, and it remains to be seen if this one will be any different.<br /><br />Personally I prefer lighter colored hats because they feel cooler and they reflect the sun you're trying to avoid. This makes me wonder why the manufacturer chose such a dark gray color for this hat? I would most definitely have chosen a lighter color if it were available. So ... if I had wanted a narrower brim and a lighter-colored hat I might have gotten this one instead, in khaki color:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Women-Sun-Protection-Fishing-Outdoor-Activities/dp/B088NNNF52"
4.0,"These are awesome, I am using them to dry my ski boots as I ski multiple consecutive days. I thought the flow through design would be better for circulating and drying the boot than stick types and I was not disappointed. These are light and compact so pack very well for trips. They would work very well in work boots or hunting boots and you can't beat putting your feet into warm, dry boots every morning."
4.0,Got a huge assortment of piercings ! Very happy with my purchase
4.0,"Great tank and very comfy. Tends to runs snug, but does stretch a little."
4.0,Comfortable summer dress. I love the pink
4.0,It's good my friends love it wanted to get it  but the price when up
4.0,"I didn't know the ends were not connects, I should have read everything. However, the pink is a pretty pale and it is super soft while still looking elegant when worn."
4.0,"This wallet is light weight, carries more that enough cards, the money clip is tight so the bills won't fall out. Plus, it's &#34;RFID protected so you feel comfortable that your credit card information is secured."
4.0,These were a gift and I would recommend to friends nice quality and good value
4.0,I love the design but the sizing is not good i ordered for 5 ft 98 lbs and i already gained weight (108.6) and it still so wide wore it for less than an hour good thing i have a change of cloth... got good compliments about the design but they said too big for me...
4.0,"Just a fyi... You need some big thighs for these to fit snug.  I prefer more control, thus boxer briefs, these would be better for real big leg guys. I'm 6 foot 220 and a workout guy. Still too big for me...I like the material, hope this helps"
4.0,"Quality is really good, the movement is seiko nh35a … the lume dial and lume bezel is nearly seiko bright …<br /><br />Finishing overall on metal surfaces are nicely done … sapphire crystal is nice<br /><br />Only con is the strap had tons of frayed stitches and I had to burn off the excess frayed stitching to make it look less horrible<br />Also the bezel has tons of play …<br /><br />Overall very good watch for the money"
4.0,These are nice and soft panties. The ribbing is there but it isn't overbearing in the touch department. These are made of 96% modal and 4% spandex. The spandex gives you just enough stretch. The modal is what makes them so soft. These will have to be machine washed and you can tumble dry on low.
4.0,"Holy super pink batman! This is MUCH more pink in person... Like 1980's fluorescent pink.... Like- I possibly could go running in the middle of the night and everyone would see this bra- pink. This is comfortable and the material is smooth and nice with good elasticity- I was able to get it on without hurting myself. I am a 38D and an XL fit perfectly- enough support, not too much bouncing, no sharp pains in the nipples from something too tight, and my breasts did not ache after my workout.  I wish the cups were sewn in place... they are removable.... that and the sheer pink-ness of this bra is my only gripe. Other than that, functionally it works great."
4.0,Decent shirt and should hold up for awhile. Good for the price I just wish it was a tad longer. The fit is kind of stout.
4.0,"Loved that it came fast but not what I expected. However, with my three sons getting robes and personalized teoel sets;this robe will make one of the boys stand out."
4.0,It's a very sturdy necklace but very pretty
4.0,I'm not a typical body shape and these fit great.  I can do thirty minutes of hard running without the usual readjustment to the waistline.
4.0,I bought this dress to wear to a formal event.  The dress is beautiful but it runs small. I had to return it.  I did order the next size up. If you are going to get this dress you will need to size up.
4.0,"I am 5’7” and 154 lbs. Bra size a 34E.  I have a long torso. The bottoms are not as high-waisted as I would have liked; they cut this mom-of-two belly off right in the middle. The top, however, is golden. I bought a M and although it fits on the smaller side, it sucks me in and holds my girls up high and tight. Little to no side boob, which is a huge plus with this type of top. I’d tried an almost identical top in a different brand and it was awful. But this top holds up in all the right places. The bottom hem wants to roll up at times, but it’s not noticeable. I’ve rocked the top a few times on vacation now (but with different bottoms) and I’ve been really happy with it. All pictures attached to this review show this top, but the bottoms I am wearing were purchased elsewhere."
4.0,"This went very well with the costume.  It was a little loose on my wrist, but looked ok."
4.0,These leggings fit so well! They are perfect gymshark dupes. They aren’t as compressed as gymshark but for the price will take it!
4.0,love my new watch yet if not kept wound up tightly it loses time a bit
4.0,Surprised how much I like it. For an off brand item it seems to be built really well. I’ve only had it for a week so I haven’t worn it skiing yet but I have worn it around in single digit temps and it’s been great. The hood is way oversized but the coat looks great with it off.
4.0,It was a lot bigger than I thought it was...
4.0,"I have a smaller top half and wider hips. 5'8"" 138 lbs. 36/30/40. I ordered the medium. It barely fits my hips. Will need a slick thin material spanx type under dress. I typically wear a 4/6."
4.0,I am pleased with my Mehr key chain. It is easy for me to slip off my car key to carry in my pocket before leaving my purse on my trunk. I also like having the two smaller key rings. That has helped me organize my keys. My only complaint is that the flexible opening mechanism is not as tight as I would like it to be. I always check to be sure it has reclosed.
4.0,It was an absolute pain to get on!! But it fits perfectly and it’s so cute and comfortable! I love it because it’s easy to slip on and off quickly :)
4.0,Good fit and quality.  Image is screen printed and not raised fabric.  But shipping was quick and they are comfy!
4.0,Very cute and my daughter loved it
4.0,"Weird material, definitely more of a polyester mix, not a lot of stretch to the waistband or neck, but I like how it's a lighter material than I'd expected."
4.0,super comfy. i leave a trail of feathers everywhere i go though. i have worn them around the house for a couple days now and the glue holding the feather boa in place has already come undone
4.0,Very nice wings and a cute idea about how they are made.  My kids didn't like them (the 4 year old) and they are too big for the 2 year old but other kids love them so we are going to donate them to my sister's kindergarten class.  They will be much appreciated there.
4.0,"When I receive my watch it didn't hit me on how nice this watch was until I kept gettin comment on how nice my watch is ,made me take a second look on my great purchase now I wear it all the time ."
4.0,"If you like huge and flashy ring, this is the right one. One of my friends commented ... &#34; it's like a chandelier&#34;."
4.0,The designer runs on the small side so always check the actual body measurements and order a size larger then you planned.  I really like this dress.  It's fun and flirty.  It's a great swing-style dress.  For my body type it hides a lot of the &#34;not so perfect&#34; aspects.
4.0,Not as big as it looks. So if you have long hair you want to tie this up with it’s a little difficult.
4.0,Could be a tad smaller and it would be better - our main purpose is nose and mouth coverage. fits 5 year old and so far it stays up but i'm worried about it stretching out - hopefully it shrinks a bit in the dryer.
4.0,Love the color the material is ok. If you are top heavy around the stomach area it is long enough and makes me look slim size up if you want a loser fit like the photo
4.0,Runs small-get it at least 1size bigger
4.0,It's OK to keep sun off from your face when you are going for a very long drive.
4.0,"Built in bra means the pads usually stay put with some support like elastic. Having a hole to get them out before washing or choose to not wear them at all.<br />When I received my top yesterday, I thought I was sent one pad. Which was laying in the bottom of the bag it was packed in. Naturally I'm thinking, ""what the heck am I going to do with one stinking pad?"". Then came the other question. ""Where the heck is the other one"". Well it was inside the shirt under the shelf part which by the way, is not tight at all to be able to hold a pad, let alone a set of girls for even the slightest of support while walking. I'm not sure what the heck to make of this garment atm. But what I do know is. I'm disappointed. I was looking for that style in a summer top with support so a bra isn't always having to be worn in the hot summer days. Well needless to say. I'm back to square one.  I don't want to have to wear a funky strappy bra all the time that can be uncomfortable, to accommodate these cute tops  ."
4.0,The material is super thin
4.0,CUTE!!! If youre buying the btlack and white stripped dress than order your actual size. Do not size up. One star off because I ordered a size larger than I needed and the seller only offered to give me 1/2 back and keep the dress instead of a full refund. but that's okay! I have a family friend who helped me out to take it in a bit. Good length!
4.0,"Gave as gift he liked them enough to go and purchase more, I think he got shorter ones tho"
4.0,"Sturdy and elegant. Purchased as bridesmaids gifts for formal wedding. Be sure to review necklace length before purchasing. They were precisely the length I wanted, but many were confused by the picture."
4.0,Loved the watch but had to return because it didn’t work
4.0,"pretty average, reliable enough to put keys on but not too much weight. it is pretty much everything you’d expect. extremely average."
4.0,"Previous experience had me order 1 size larger than the amazon size guide.  Fit perfectly.  I'm in the Florida Keys for the winter where the sun is much stronger than the center of the US.  After a few hours there is a slight tan beginning to appear.  Slow process compared with back, legs and exposed skin.  Might eventually remove the tan lines but appears to be a slow process which is why I give it 4 stars..  As advertised they are NOT see through wet or dry which is a good thing for people around this retired old geezer.  Would not be a pretty sight.  Washing with normal load, no special handling had no damaging effect."
4.0,I bought this for my grand daughter for health reasons.  The stones are pretty but would pinch the hair on her arm.  I don't know if she's noticed any health benefits while wearing it.
4.0,Scratch easy. I didn't know there was a white outline on the frame. It's good for the amount I paid. I like them.
4.0,LOVe them!!
4.0,Red is pretty but we were missing a few of the backings. It's okay though.
4.0,"I think the bee on the front could have been done with something other than pearls and it would have been cuter. Probably not the deal choice for an everyday purse, but it is cute."
4.0,True to ad
4.0,"Legit. Tool with the band didn't work, dropped $12 to get links removed but it was worth it. Pops saw the band and thought I spent too much on a new watch (again). I love my blaze and this made it perfect for more formal events. I recommend"
4.0,"It’s really pretty, just hurts a little bit if you have it on for longer but it’s gorgeous."
4.0,"This is a flattering dress that can be good for the office with a nice addition of a tailored jacket and proper pumps. My busty loves, this gives moderate coverage of ones ample bosom.  However, if you aren't comfortable with the amount of cleavage (a little peek a boo) it looks just as good pinned properly.  I left off a star because the top (blouse) portion of the dress is of a different fabric. I would have preferred that it was the same as the skirt portion of the dress.  The combination works, it just isn't my preference."
4.0,The dress fits well and I use it for every day dress
4.0,This bathing suit is great. It is true to size and is very flatterable. I seen other negative reviews and was nervous about purchasing this product but I am so glad that I did. This is now my new favorite bathing suit
4.0,"I like the cool cotton material and the decorative bow in the back.  I want customers to know that the hat I got doesn't exactly match the photos here. My hat has a different kind of trim around the hat, it has a full tied bow in the back, it has no jewel-look decoration on the side."
4.0,"Very bright and cute.  It is a little snug, but still works."
4.0,Comfy. Love it!
4.0,Good glasses at a good value. I’ve actually purchased a couple pairs of days. Our use them as back ups from my regular eyeglasses. The only thing I could say that’s negative about them is they are a little bit fragile and the frames tend to bend a little too quickly. But all in all I really like them
4.0,"Fits well , but has a high crown."
4.0,Wish it was a little bit bigger but it is fine :) very pretty!
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3405cb01d61e38dc07459efcbe14b168]] I'm a big fan of silver jewelry, and even better when it's feminine and classy. When I was offered this lovely little bracelet I thought I would check it out.<br /><br />It is a beautiful bracelet. the tiny diamonds on the little heart sparkle nicely and it's such a dainty design. I love the adjustment, and it was easy to adjust by myself. My one personal concern is this: though I have a small wrist at 6.25"" -I had a very hard time getting the bracelet on over my hand (palm being over 3"" across). Over time putting this bracelet on and taking it off will only stress the chain and links more. So unfortunately I will have to find a friend or family member with smaller hands where that won't be a concern. My other concern is with those who truly have a 7.5"" wrist thinking this bracelet will fit, I don't think will- especially without the bracelet being fully extended, which would be a shame because having the little silver ends a bit loose is part of what adds to the charm of the bracelet.<br /><br />As with most nicer jewelry it's not good to wear it in hot showers as it can loosen prongs and/or glue and then stones start to disappear so I'm not comfortable with putting it on and leaving it on myself.<br /><br />That being said this is a lovely little piece and for the right person with a small wrist and a small hand to get it over."
4.0,"Ever since I bought these gloves the temperatures became mild and haven't tried the gloves in cold wintery weather. However, the gloves fit well."
4.0,Great spring dress!
4.0,"go through many of these types of shirts per year, generally just running, biking, etc. My favorites are Nike and Adidas, but they've become quite costly. I thought that I would try one of these as a cheaper alternative, since all I do is ruin them with sweat anyway. So far, so good! The material seems to be on par with the others, and the fit is fine. It seems slightly less ""fitted"" than my Adidas, but doesn't look baggy or goofy. Just looks like a dry-fit tee. The shirt is good enough that I'm going to buy a few more. I'll know more by the end of the summer, but so far, this looks like a fantastic deal"
4.0,"These are passible for day to day use, but I wouldn't wear them to the Ambassador's ball or anything."
4.0,Grandson loved it and it helped him hold the ukulele much better.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:565ae6bc7a8e7ec790f902d1198ab1db]] Nice fit and material
4.0,I love these tanks. But sad to mention my sleeve part had fallen apart. The stitch where you put your arm in has separated. Instead of 3 I’m down to two. Still love em
4.0,I love it because my dog is a chocolate lab and it's super cute.
4.0,"This dress is very pretty. It has a very nice cut that is flattering. I felt like it was thinning. I also liked that the material was so soft. It was stretchy so the size was forgiving as well. It had a belt.<br /><br />The quality was good. It seemed well made.<br /><br />The only reason I took off a star was I felt it was a bit thin. I would have preferred if it was a little bit thicker. It is also a fairly short dress. I am short, and for me it was fine, but do pay attention to length.<br /><br />I felt like it was very versatile. It is nice for a casual day out. Overall, I did like it and would recommend it."
4.0,Cute & comfy. Looks great with my work slacks!
4.0,"These are gorgeous, quality is better than expected. They dont stretch too much at the waist so i have to jiggle my butt into them a little, but I love how they look! Only thing is they are not as long as i would have liked (im 5'7'', for reference), so i only wear them with heels and they look really well!"
4.0,"I ordered a size 2 in pink blush and I want to say the dress itself is very pretty and well made, I was so excited once it arrived but the top half of the dress is huge! If you are not a full C cup or a D dont even try. I'm not sure why their smallest size would have such large and long chest areas but it did not work for me at all and after getting it tailored (floor length and taking in the back straps) it only looked worse. I gave 4 stars cause the company was very nice and worked with me on the return process options but I am bummed that I bought such a cheap dress, spent double the price on the alterations only to have to buy something else now. After alterations and it still not fitting properly it gave me the feeling that the dress was a straples and the lace part was just sewn onto the top to make it a halter causing it to be super long, idk maybe thats why it was $35 only too? I will say for a larger chest this could be a great dress it's very pretty, the back zipper area fit me fine around and did not need any adjustments there, the tailor was trying to take in the top back straps for me in hopes it would help with that extra length from the front but it didnt help me. For reference I'm 5'2 and 110lbs and 32b."
4.0,Best dress. But not for summers
4.0,"Hanging chain strands become tangled and twisted. Suggest care in the handling and storage of this item.  Otherwise, very pretty!"
4.0,My son loves this shirt he says it's super soft. He literally chooses to wear it everytime it is in his drawer.  It didn't shrink in the wash and I've washed it many times. Love colored organics the quality has been great with each buy.
4.0,I use these at work when I work on the computer.
4.0,"Although the slip is a little looser than I expected, it is still very comfortable. It feels as if it isn't there, yet covers what needs to be covered. Since I have gained weight, and my previous slip of this size was &#34;I can't quite breathe&#34; tight, this new undergarment makes a great change. I feel more freedom. I recommend this slip."
4.0,The waist fits perfectly but the thighs fit weird.  I use the waist portion alone and it works great.  The thighs are super uncomfortable and doesn’t fix perfectly in the loops.
4.0,"Love it! I use it every day, Love the color"
4.0,"There are a ton of these.... I meant to get this for my girlfriend for her graduation, but it didn't fit her tassel."
4.0,The fabric is slippery so I wore shorts over. They are super cute!
4.0,All in all it is ok. could be about an eighth of an inch larger. Fits tight.
4.0,Sleeves are a little tight.
4.0,"I bought this outfit for a baby shower, they loved it. But it runs a little big"
4.0,Cleaned my bracelet easily
4.0,The hood is a lot bigger than I like. It lets too much air on the sides.
4.0,I love them.  I think they are super cute!
4.0,"Fit well, but a little heavier knit than I expected. Good compression for work."
4.0,Muy grandes los cogi para el pelo
4.0,Great glasses!! My daughter loved them.  😁
4.0,Awesome little number. Order one size up
4.0,Haven't got to put them on in the lake yet :) but I did review them a few mins in the tub. As soon as I put them on they sucked my eyeballs in lol thy have perfect grips around your eyes that's for sure! I didn't try to long but no water got in. They got nice straps around your face with plenty of adjusting room. Nose plugs included! Seriously can't wait to see in the lake this year! & they are cute pinkish red. One of the rubber pieces was broke on my case but besides that love them.
4.0,"Its light and not to thick, perfect for fall weather.size runs little larger"
4.0,I purchased this for a gift and wished I would've purchased one for myself. Very pretty! My friend loved this necklace!
4.0,Sole is thicker than I expected but that's probably a plus.
4.0,it's heavier than I thought it was!
4.0,"I ordered and quickly received the Fitbit Alta Band, Yearscase Classic Wristband Strap Bracelet with Secure Silicone Fasteners Metal Clasps for Fitbit Alta/Fitbit Alta Band/Fitbit Alta Bands(No Tracker).

4.0,"I was really excited when they arrived especially when I opened the box and the color is even prettier than in the picture, just the right kind of grey. I sprayed them with suede preserving spray and they look great before and after snow.<br />The only thing- they are a little bit difficult to walk in,<br />they are more on the shallow side, so theres no support for the ancle and since the platform and the heel make them very wobbly. You just have to walk carefully, and the other thing- the heel has a plastic ending so it gets slippery when you wear them indoors."
4.0,"The central gem came unglued very quickly, but it was easier enough to fix with a tiny bit of thread and five minutes. A few stitches around the top, bottom, and side loops have kept the cameo well positioned ever since."
4.0,VERY STYLISH AND EYE CATCHING BEAUTY
4.0,"Sticks to your mouth, has no shapeable nose area and gapes open on the sides of your face by the ears."
4.0,I got this for my Mother of Dragons Halloween costume.  It looked great and is fun to wear even not dressed up as her!
4.0,I found the dress fit very well on my girlfriend loved it !!!
4.0,"Soy 34C ordené talla M y me quedó perfecto! las costuras son muy buenas y de excelente material. Me gustó pq es muy cómodo, el sport Bra es doble Forro, la tela interna es transpirable. Lo e usado varias veces para mí rutina de ejercicios y es muy bueno para los ejercicios de alta intensidad."
4.0,Too small. Had to send it back. Wasn’t sure when I ordered it. Nice coat just too small
4.0,Really liked the gray/teal.. It's a heavy enough weight to actually be a light jacket as opposed to just a fashionable piece. My Ship time was insane ( almost 50 days from order). But I have worn pretty much daily for last 30 days ( it really works with everything!). Washes well. Runs Very small (recommend to upsize  2-3 sizes) and shorted them pictured but still long enough.
4.0,I was sad cuz it dident fit but it looks so cute I am so happy it fit my friend at least so I ended up giving it to her just order a size smaller cuz if your a 7 just order a 6 so it can fit but it's cute do recomed
4.0,I got an XL. I’m a size L but I wanted it a little over sized. It’s cute and I’ve gotten compliments on it but just wish it was a little softer. It’s kind of stiff. Not what I was expecting but still cute.
4.0,It fits like a typical unisex shirt. I just have to watch which bra I wear under it or wear an undershirt or else you can see my bra. I love it though.
4.0,"Strap is very cute, easy to change. Leather is a little stiff but I like to use it for special/dressier work out fits. Pretty good for the price!"
4.0,Fitted a little on the small side
4.0,I hoped that it would be a little bit bigger but I'm satisfied with the quality and plan on buying a larger one next time
4.0,"The waist string is very resistant, which is good for waring, but poses a problem when you need to change pants fast."
4.0,"Good overall quality. Soft and comfortable. Fits accordingly. A little thin though, I expected them to be a little warmer."
4.0,Nice fabric. Good padding we and made well.
4.0,"My son loves these boots!  He's a hard one to please, but the fit, bungee straps, and color are his favorites!"
4.0,"This are really adorable earrings. I absolutely love them. They are a really good size, not too big, not too small. I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the earrings is missing a stone."
4.0,"Perfect fit, looked great on my daughter."
4.0,"The wide brim will provide good sun protection when we travel.  It is lightweight and I like the chin strap as the hat that I currently use doesn't have one and I always worry that the wind will take it.  It also fits comfortably and is not too tight like my current hat.  It has an adjustable strap to make it smaller if needed.  There are creases from folding, but I am sure that those can be ironed out."
4.0,LA TALLA VARIA
4.0,Cute bracelet and I'm not Yoakum a bracelet person. This isn't large or bulky so doesn't get in the way of wrist movement. Love the color. Had held up very nicely. Would recommend.
4.0,The earrings are gorgeous!!!  Absolutely love how they look. My first attempt to amwear them I had a hard time getting one to clasp shut and wound up wearing another pair of earrings.  Will give it another try as I loves the look of them!!
4.0,This necklace is elegant and dainty. Well worth the cost. This will be given as a birthday gift.
4.0,"Very nice dainty bracelet, just wish it was as silver as my other jewelry and not so rustic."
4.0,I like them but they have a tendency to fall off and are a bit bulky
4.0,"bought it on a limb even though the image couldn't be enlarged, but it turned out to be a beautiful piece to wear. The diamonds are a little bigger than i would have liked but for the price and quality it is a worthwhile buy. Beautiful when worn!!"
4.0,Nice quality but it runs a bit small
4.0,I bought this alongside an actual silver chain. The metals don't match perfectly but hey it's still pretty neat
4.0,Good quality!  Cut tight thru the waistline (fitted) - ordered a large (usually wear medium) but still hard to zip up due to the cut - will probably just wear it open.
4.0,"Earrings are very pretty and very big, luckily I have a friend who will love them."
4.0,Fits nicely even after washing.
4.0,"Absolutely loved this dress,fit very nicely"
4.0,A gift for a mortician. She seemed o enjoy it and praised the quality.
4.0,"I love this outfit. The quality is nice,  but runs small.  I wear medium, but had to return it for a large, and even the large was a small medium, but I'll manage."
4.0,I live these I got the classic capris to travel in and they are comfortable and easy clean.  The downside is no pockets or belt loops...I found the capris tend to slouch down so a belt would have been handy.  Overall though comfy and easy travel wear.
4.0,"I bought this bodysuit for my halloween costume. It is very cute and very soft. Although, there was no clasps on the crotch, so good luck going pee if you have tights and spanks on. I made the mistake of putting this on over the spanks because if I didn't the spanks would have been showing. So using the bathroom was not possible unless I completely undressed. Also, if you are going to wear this with jeans, they need to be high rise jeans because it sits high on your hips. But it worked for what I needed it for, it's very cute, very soft and a very pretty blue. I am 5'6"" and 125lbs. I ordered a small and it fit perfect."
4.0,A great shirt for a Cubs fan.
4.0,"Since we are all forced to slap masks on our faces when we step outside our door, l thought this shirt with built in mask would be fun.  It would be nice not to have to worry about having a mask with me.<br />  The color is not quite as pictured.  It is more of a coral than a pink, although I still like the color and I didn’t have that shade in my wardrobe.  Just be forewarned that the colo you order may be off from what you ordered.<br />  I find the size (I ordered a small) bigger than l expected.  Is a little loose and not very flattering.  However, I like a snugger fit.<br />  I wore this to run around Christmas shopping.  It was so convenient to have the built in mask.  The mask is as comfortable as a mask can be fit fine over my ears and nose.<br />  Overall, I would recommend this shirt.  It is a good price and the quality is fair."
4.0,"The constellation is not correct but it's a very pretty necklace with a great fit. I wear it very often, even knowing that it is inaccurate."
4.0,"Looks good from a distance.  Up close the seal is blurry and almost illegible, but for the price I'm happy. Some of the others I looked at were clearer, but the seal was not round, but appeared oval like it distorted when they stretched the image. Overall very happy with this tag."
4.0,"I like these gloves. If super cold out, fingers still get cold, but great for doing outdoor workouts"
4.0,Nice pants but run on the small side
4.0,"The material is soft and comfy. The pants are a little long, but I have shorter legs. I purchased for cooler camping nights."
4.0,these are great light weight pjs.  they do shrink a little.
4.0,"Great product however, I'd prefer an automatic open. Otherwise, this sunbrella does the job quite well."
4.0,Bought them big for comfort. Perfect.
4.0,Last night it stopped at 4:30am. I have to wear it the whole day.
4.0,Great item just ran too small I couldn't even wear it. The size is men's large but seems more like small being I am a woman and felt like it was going to rip so I didn't attempt to wear it.
4.0,"Beautiful corset. Comfortable and sexy. You have to be careful with the feathers, though, but worth the money."
4.0,"Very cute, quality piece of jewelry. I get compliments on it all the time. No complaints :)"
4.0,Short and shrank a little when cleaned.
4.0,Good quality and fits appropriately. The ribbon for the sleeves is WAY too short. So prepare to buy ribbon if you want it to fit like pictured.
4.0,"I liked this dress because of the tiered design. I think it is more ""forgiving"" in the midsection area, so I don't feel as self-conscious about myself as I usually do. The flutter sleeve is also a nice feminine touch."
4.0,"Can't see phone screen with while looking right at it with shades on, but good glasses overall."
4.0,They were sure cute for your face and fit well.  They just took longer than I exspected to get them.
4.0,"This is very comfortable and the fabric is so soft.  I love it, however, the one received is navy with white designs and not the blue as pictured."
4.0,"These shorts are such a cute print! (I got the floral print.) They are pretty cute on but the fabric does pooch out a bit right under the drawstring and in the front in general, which isn't super flattering on a tiny bit of mommy belly, but you can kind of pull the fabric in different ways on the drawstring to help. The main body of the shorts are pretty baggy, while the elastic is fitted to my waist. The fabric is a slicklish material, soft, but not linen or cottony which I kind of felt they looked like in the photos. All in all, I like them pretty well."
4.0,"5'2"" 119 lbs. Purchased size small good fit ."
4.0,"These leggings fit a little snug, but I still like them. I would get the next size up."
4.0,"An A-lIne dress looks good on just about every shape.  This one is no different.  The fabric is decent quality and forgiving.  The color of the trim is red (bright) on smaller sizes of the dress.  We exchanged dress for a larger sized dress and the trim color is definitely more wine or burgundy color-- which is fine for us.  Be careful if you are planning for only the brighter red color because the dress you receive may not have it.  Definitely size up one to two sizes; this definitely runs small, but nice dress for the price.  Nice vintage look."
4.0,Very good quality but runs big for women when I say big I mean BIG but the quality will make have it sewn to fit.
4.0,Warm but too constricting.
4.0,"I bought this to take on an upcoming Walt Disney World trip. It is not the best quality necklace, but it is very nice. It is perfect for my six year old daughter. The chain could be nicer. Other than that I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,Really cuts down on glare and makes everything appear crisp
4.0,"Fit great, I do have bigger thighs so the spandex rolls up occasionally but I would say true to size and very comfortable"
4.0,These shorts are much better than some that I have tried.  They are not nearly as binding to the point you can't move in them and they don't roll up - two features I love.  They are very comfortable and can be worn all day without discomfort.  Would definitely buy them again and in other colors.
4.0,So I love these pants and they were a better option than the $70 molecule ones I’ve had my eye on.  Only thing I don’t like is the crotch is cut like mans jeans so it’s really low.  You could pull them up really high but then the top of the pants are under my rib cage and honestly it kinda makes you look like you have a fupa I did keep them though as they are okay for the money.  Wish it was easier to contact the seller though since they stated they could tailor them to you.
4.0,"Wanted the hippo key chain they sent totally different one. So I sent back. The ad was misleading, however, the quality of product is excellent. Plus the customer service of returning item was great."
4.0,Dainty but a good statement piece.
4.0,"Order at least one size up, it runs small. Cute dress, don't put it in the dryer or it will shrink a full size down."
4.0,I love it. I don't know if it looks good on me. I wear it as a house dress. It feels nice. It is a cotton spandex blend. It feels light. I bought one and have worn it for a while now. I am about to buy another one. I just need to pick a color.
4.0,"Fits really nicely, and goes with everything! The material is a little thinner than I thought it would be, but it’s still perfect for cool nights out."
4.0,"Wish the tie was longer, like the color, for the price it is a great value"
4.0,Cute satchel
4.0,"Great pants (fit, quality, material)...however they were CREAM colored and not WHITE as expected (as seen in the photo), and the backside seams are somewhat unflattering."
4.0,"Saw great reviews and decided to try these leggings. Based on reviews, I ordered a M (size, 5'9, 150) and they fit well. If anything I'd consider sizing up for comfort with the high waist. I ordered the heathered charcoal color, and it was shinier and rougher feeling than I expected- hard to tell whether or not it was see-through due to the shine. Unfortunately, between the fabric feel and shine they weren't for me! Will return for something softer and my normal matte black."
4.0,"I've purchased a ton of these types socks, but never use them because they bunch up at the toes or fall off the heel. These socks actually work for my foot (i'm an 8.5). The socks don't go as far up on the top of the foot as shown in these pictures, but still stay in place within the shoe."
4.0,It was cute but pretty thin. I liked it and it worked out for my Christmas outfit. I probably could’ve sized up to have a more comfortable fit though.
4.0,"These are wonderful, they helped my legs not hurt while on the airplane and didn't overheat my legs or feet. If you wear them in hot weather then it course your feet might get sweaty, which happened to me but only after a few hours of having to wear them outside the airport because I didn't have a chance to take them off.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change is that they have that pattern on them and the seams press in lines on my legs so when going from wearing these for hours and then taking them off to wear shorts and sandals I'm left with indentations of long weird lines in my legs and feet. It looks ugly and they slightly hurt from being pressed in so long. It does bother a bit when you have them on too but not enough to make me feel the need to remove the socks. This is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars, however they do work really well to help reduce swelling and pain. Just be aware of that in case you're planning on wearing a party dress or something right after that you will have lines in your legs for a bit after taking these off."
4.0,"After getting and wearing this hat for a few days, I don't think I can ever go back to wearing a regular beanie. It's fairly comfortable, love the color, and the Bluetooth works fantastically. Incredibly easy to pair with my phone and computer. Doesn't skip or drop connection. I only have a few small issues with it.<br /><br />1. The housing for the Bluetooth which the controls is a bit bulky and I can definitely feel it on my ear after a while. I also creates a noticeable bump on the hat.<br />2. The beanie is pretty small. Maybe I'm used to wearing &#34;slouchy&#34; style beanies but my head isn't that big and I still constantly have to pull the speakers back down over my ears.<br />3. I have to charge my hat.<br /><br /> Over all a great intro into the world of BT beanies."
4.0,Nice soft sweater. I ordered one or two sizes up and it fits well.
4.0,"Great, cute gift"
4.0,My sin likes them. They are very lite but seem durable.
4.0,"This is really cute, material is thick, and it's comfortable. I'm  5'6"", 123lbs, 34-26-36 and I got a small."
4.0,These are adorable and came early.
4.0,"Love it,  was a gift for my grandson, love the price"
4.0,Good quality and size and it is beautiful but very see through in the back.
4.0,I like the material I think I need one X not 2X and also I need the Maroon color. I'm returning it and get another one. (In maroon color and size 1x)
4.0,Really digging my new ring.  It's perfect for that rock look without being too clunky.  I even play guitar while wearing it.
4.0,Came way before estimated delivery date which was awesome. The top fit great but the bottoms still seemed like a small which was odd. Not sure if it's because I have thicker thighs but it hugs a little to tight on the bikini line and the hip line. I'm 5'2 124lbs and I ordered a large.
4.0,Very nice.  Christmas gift for my grand daughter.  She is going to love them.
4.0,"Fit's to my size perfectly. Although they were shorter than what I would've liked. I purchased a size 34 waist, they must be about a 32 length"
4.0,I think the clips with the colored stones are richer looking than the silver ones without
4.0,This beanie is very cute but it's definitely not what I expected. I ordered the maroon shade but in my opinion it has a lot more pinky undertones than expected. Also I'm the picture I thought it was going to be slouchy but that's not the case at all. It beanie and it's still warm just not what I was hoping for.
4.0,Wish there were sizes as they are a bit big for a woman's hand so a lil hard to work the way they are supposed to.
4.0,Granddaughter was pleased. Size was exactly as ordered.
4.0,"This was a very cute dress. Perfect for summer and then early fall with a little jacket.  Unfortunately, it ran too small for me, so I requested a larger size. Amazon sent me the same size again.  Now I have to return the second dress too. Giving up on my dress...:("
4.0,"My child loves wearing this thing, in the pool, bath tub or just watching tv.  The tail is awesome. However, the crown was broken when i recieved it. I almost would have rather not had the crown. She wouldn't have missed it but of course she was disappointed when it came broken. I didn't reach out to the seller bc it was so cheap i didn't even want that.  But the tail is A+!"
4.0,"Love the style. I have a stash of nicer buttons, so I swapped out the plastic ones that came on the sweater. I wear this with a tunic underneath. Love it!"
4.0,"Had to return. Wish I were taller, life would be easier"
4.0,Cute and nice soft material but size 18-24m is much too big on my 2 year old. Especially the pants. I will reorder in a smaller size
4.0,"I like it. The trim is not a lite pink ,more of red trim and it is a small purse repeat it is a small purse"
4.0,"This bra offers great support, I am a 34D and I use it mostly for running. It is not super stretchy around the band and therefore it was a bit tight on me. I would order it again and go up a size or two in the band."
4.0,They get runs really easy but are very cute. Not for people who are rough on their clothing.
4.0,"This set was as cute as expected, however, I got the 12-18month, it fits way too big for my daughter, she is short but chubby, with tiny feet, the shoes are approx. size four. I have to return only because she won't fit it in a month. Positive, the package arrived way before schedule, in about a week time. Also came with an extra how, SUPER CUTE and matches way better then the crown, which is more of a purple color, but still cute, on a cute headband, and it is just a clip, so easy to replace. I would buy from this seller again, now that I know to order small. And I should have read the measurements!"
4.0,"The material is soft. I bought this shirt for myself (female) so I could match my brothers (bought 2 of the blue color block). The fit was good for myself, but the xl and XXL for my brothers had a smaller fit.<br />The red collar bled into the off white shirt, in cold water, which was disappointing. Watch the care if you're going to buy. Blue version held up well in the wash."
4.0,"So far I’ve only tried the earring in the picture, but it’s great for my daith piercing. It is a little big, but it’s not uncomfortable to sleep with it in. Plus it’s beautiful. Took a bit of finagling to get it clicked shut, but it didn’t take much longer than a couple of minutes. So far so good."
4.0,For the money it was a cute gift for my grandson to give to his friend
4.0,"I'm 5ft tall, 130 lbs and the dress fit great! It fits like a short dress and is cute/sexy. The only thing is the collar was a little odd, it was loose rather than tight like in the picture. I ended up cutting the little section of the collar off and making it a full V neck dress. It would have gotten 5 stars if the collar were better"
4.0,This is hilarious
4.0,Runs a little smaller than i thought however i liked it.  No front pocket
4.0,Its adorable and my daughter loves it but the top is a bit hard to get on and off. Just a little smaller than expexted
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f19d0b5c9e1566d9a109274bc7409174]] I was super excited when I saw that the pants had two deep front pockets. The pants sizing was correct as well as the undershirt, but the jacket was super tight and I had to keep pulling the back down. The Star belt was super cool, but when I unraveled it, one of the stars on the tip was broken and I don’t think I can glue it back on. All in all totally worth the money if you size up! Not the original purpose of the video, but I think it shows a pretty good angle of all of the sides. (Photo and video is without filters to show accurate coloring)"
4.0,"smaller than i hoped, but otherwise perfect"
4.0,The bag is functional and I higher quality than I could get locally. I am satisfied that it will do just what inneed it to do.
4.0,Super cute and great material
4.0,I really love the dress but the elastic waist is a little to snug. I wish they sent instructions on how to create all the different types of styles
4.0,wife like them
4.0,"I’m 5’6, 136# and I got a medium. I’m a 40 year old mom of 3 and I didn’t feel like I was trying to hard in this jumper! Big plus. I paired with some open toe shoes and I’ll wear on our cruise."
4.0,"comfortable,  washed cold, dry flat, no dryer and didn't shrink yay👏"
4.0,"This is a Simple and Clean Design, Comfortable, and the velcro works very well. I will be getting colors for sure"
4.0,Value for money and it is affordable and my kid wears for her ballet and they are great even for rough use
4.0,Huge mask! Very bright and cute. Difficult to see the “sun”. Looks more like just a Smiley Face.
4.0,"I'm 6 Ft, 214 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal and the 2x fits great. Just oversized enough to accept a fleece or sweat shirt if needed and not so big as to feel big over a polo."
4.0,"Put small ""stuff"" in one of these (ball markers or green repairs), not in my pockets."
4.0,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️'s, if only I had known to order up a size!  It is a feat of unbelievable effort to get these on, usually too tired to pursue a rigorous run or brisk walk!  But, they are absolutely amazing support!!!!"
4.0,These was for my grand daughter
4.0,"This F91W-1 is pretty awesome for the price , I like it so much that I bought a second for my son. The watch works just fine every now and then you might accidently press the military time button on the right lower side of the watch, but no big deal press it again and it goes back to the 12hr mode.Really Cool Watch if you ask me."
4.0,Very nice bag...i would buy it again
4.0,Very cute and flattering....the material could be a little nicer but still a great dress
4.0,"I ordered a medium and it was really small I usually wear a size 6. I ordered a large and it was really big so I ordered another  medium that one fit, it was a little snug but better then loose and falling off in the water. It's 100% adorable though.  I love it"
4.0,not sure I like this fit.  Looks like an old lady
4.0,This is a lovely dress...but I would order up 2 sizes.
4.0,Great piece of jewelry. Nice cuts of silver and turquoise
4.0,"Soft fabric, looks fairly durable. Flattering fit, though it’s a bit long. I tied a knot at the bottom of the front panel and I’m pretty sure the back panel drags on the ground a bit. I’m relatively tall (5’7”) so the length surprised me. Great summer dress."
4.0,"I bought the light khaki and it looks exactly like the picture in the ad.  The jacket fits perfectly on me.  I am 5'11"" and weigh 165 lbs with a 32"" waist.  I bought the Medium and it is just right.  The lining material is nice but this is a thin jacket and not meant for very cold weather.<br /><br />I knocked off one star because when it arrived it was missing one of the 3 buttons that close the front of the jacket.  I took the one off the back and put it on the front and since I had to put one on I decided to move the other 2 buttons 1/2"" over to make the jacket fit a little slimmer.  Worked like a charm and I love this jacket.<br /><br />This jacket looks good with casual as well as more dressy outfits but probably not formal."
4.0,"I saw these all over Europe, or like styles, have several different ones, always get positive feedback"
4.0,"I like this wallet. It's a great size for my purse. Not too big or too small with plenty of slots for debit and/or debit cards plus side inserts for a drivers license or photo I.D. I like how there are 2 compartments. The other side of the wallet you can put coins, cash, business cards, etc. it's a multi-purpose wallet. The quality is good and I would recommend."
4.0,The comfort and fit met my expectations.  I have diabetes so I needed specific support for circulation purposes and feet protection.
4.0,It’s perfect. Except a little bit too long. Very comfortable. I purchased 3 for work.
4.0,Running shorts are extremely expensive. I believe these are competitively price and feel great. I have yet to have these bunch up while running.
4.0,"I love the mask, but I'm disappointed that the photos don't show how the lights are actually ran on the outside of the mask (on the face). The different lighting options are awesome (solid, flashing etc). The battery pack buzzes, but it's so quiet that it's not that big of a deal."
4.0,"Nice material and overall look, but it’s a bit too cropped for me"
4.0,"At first glance,  I noticed the size of the socks exceeded expectations, although i do believe its fair with the size chart. I like ankle sock  because you get the look and feel as if you aren't wearing socks without sacrificing  comfort. I gave 4 stars for two reasons. I like the look and feel. I would like a thicker material and im not sure why but they seemed overly packaged with all individual pairs packaged separately within the package."
4.0,"comfy, a bit warm though"
4.0,"Great look and feel.  But I'm tall.  Fits well, but I wish they were just a little longer."
4.0,Bigger than I like but keeping item
4.0,A little big but it works and it's super cute
4.0,Just a little big on the ribcage area. But super cute.
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty and delicate looking. I have received complements every time I wear them.  However, the picture is somewhat misleading.  The earrings and the stones are much smaller than pictured. That said, I really like the produce, and the packaging is very attractive and suitable for gifting"
4.0,It works well and I like it. I think I would like it just a little more if it was a little wider. But overall it's great.
4.0,"Cute, simple necklace I can wear with anything!"
4.0,"Very cute, very soft, it's a very little smaller than I expected, when I bought a different set from the same company it was a little larger.  But it's still super cute and very comfy!  The print is adorbs."
4.0,"Beautiful just what I was expected,very happy with it"
4.0,True to size but a little Too expensive
4.0,The skirt is beautiful but runs small. I am a size 12 and ordered a large but was unable to fit it. I gave the skirt to someone who is not as curvy and is 10... it fit her perfectly. I would suggest those with more curves to buy a size up.
4.0,Cute boots for the price!
4.0,"They are cute, there’s a variety, Im not having an allergic reaction, my only complaint is that the clickers are hard to click into the correct position once in your nose, they often slide to the side/past the clicker spot, and that it’s hard to unscrew the pointed one"
4.0,"Nice swimsuit for the price but runs very, very small! Had to return it."
4.0,After back surgery I wasn’t able to been over. I could put these on.
4.0,Nice coat but it does not fit correctly
4.0,"Really cute!! XL was just a bit tight under the arms, probably because I need more room in the bust."
4.0,Mother-in-law liked them.
4.0,"It's true that it's not much of a sturdy product but the high rating consideres the price which I thought was mora than fair.<br />Already used it in a few travels and it does what it's supposed to - separate two fine shirts with ties from the rest of you baggage.<br /><br />It's true that you can fit 4 ties (two in each compartment), but it gets too squeezed if you do.<br />There should be a separate little compartment for collar stays and cufflinks."
4.0,These are really nice silks and were mailed very quickly. I wold have given five stars yet based on the image I thought I was getting more of a light rose color and what I got was more of a bright fuchsia color.
4.0,"It fit as expected . Looks good at a great price . The material is slightly thinner than  compression shirts from other companies through Amazon , but still a satisfied customer . Also , only 3 days delivery with standard free shipping ."
4.0,"Way better than I expected it to be.<br />Pretty accurate to the picture provided.<br />I only wanted this shirt for a costume, but it seems like I could save it for a normal use,<br />I got the biggest size since I was really unsure about the sizing (you never know when ordering online!), but for an XL it seemed kind of small for that size (I usually wear a M)..it probably fit like a loose M or a moderate L.<br />It had this chemical smell to it, but it faded away after a wash."
4.0,This is a gift 🎁 for my son for Christmas they are better then expected
4.0,Fits my charms perfectly and haven't had any reaction but just be aware that this is a lobster claw clasp and not a pandora style one. Otherwise a fine charm bracelet.
4.0,golden anniversary perfect gift to myself  for a valentine 50th anniversary
4.0,"I think at 26.99 this was a fair price, not the best deal but not bad either. The pattern is really cute and the dress is super versatile. I styled it under a sweater one day, over a turtle neck also, and it will work with all of my blazers and tops for fall. Overall very cute. It's comfortable too because the fabric is thin. Not very long though. If I want it at an appropriate length for professional wear I need to loosen the straps and pull it under my breasts and wear a sweater overtop. I have this problem with all miniskirts and most dresses, though...I got a big booty."
4.0,Good for the price. Look great
4.0,"I bought the white and very see through, almost translucent. I'm sure that the black and other colors may not be as see through. but very comfortable dress and 100% cotton."
4.0,"Not really meant for a long torso, but the adjustable ties help. Rouching on the sides is flattering.  Constructed like a connected 2-piece."
4.0,This is much larger then I expected but not bad
4.0,"Very cute and warm but way too big for our 6mo old. It could fold all the way down to her waist. Also there's a bit of a chemical smell. It's so cute though, we will save it for when she's older."
4.0,Me gusta el material Lo compré size L y me quedo grande d arriba y el pantalón ancho d abdomen...pero como me gusta coser lo adapte a mi y ahora me queda perfecto...peso 165 y mido 5'6..
4.0,"The shoes are very nice looking (my soccer playing kids even said, ""those are lit dad!"". A bit tighter than I expected size wise on the width, length was fine (I have a narrow foot, so not usual that I find a shoe tight)"
4.0,"Its fine, but the smell it's terrible!"
4.0,Please with the quality and appearance of the scarf for the price.
4.0,"They fit fine, look good and seem constructed to last awhile. Great price at under 10 bucks."
4.0,Columbia brand seems superior quality
4.0,The birthstones arent as prominent as the pictures and the chain isn't all that impressive
4.0,"Very cute, looks exactly as pictured. Sturdy piece, its kind of bulky if you have slender fingers but still adorable for dog lovers."
4.0,These are larger than I expected.  I will order small next time.
4.0,"These are super cute and good quality for the price. However these are a good in or more too big. I ordered the size my child wears in other shoes, but these run pretty big. I'll keep them though. They'll fit eventually!"
4.0,I like the sweater and the color at offers however I felt that the material was a little bit on the thin side. It is nice but Not for a windy day in the fall time.
4.0,"The glasses are great. They are a much lighter pink than the photo, but still pretty."
4.0,"These pants have a soft, silky feel and are somewhat &#34;shiny.&#34; I think they're true to size and love to be able to choose the inseam length. Im 5'9&#34; and ordered both a 32&#34; and 34&#34;....I'll have to return the 34s, they're way too long and with this material would be impossibe to roll up. But I'll definitely order another pair in the 32 length. I live in Wisconsin and will wear these year round, not too thin not too thick. Overall, great work pants for the office!!"
4.0,They’re bigger than I thought they’d be but other than that I really like them
4.0,"I probably should have gotten a size smaller.. Great, light weight! Perfect for Las Vegas wingers"
4.0,"Larger then what I expected, but it is a gift for my niece at college. The quality is great, and the picture accurately shows what the product looks like."
4.0,I like them...
4.0,Thin material but looks great with a camisole underneath.
4.0,It was very soft material and didn’t wrinkle.  For me it was a little too high wasted.
4.0,Nice glases
4.0,"Wish it was on chain instead on string, other than thay, amazing!"
4.0,"I hate my arms, and I hate clothes that accentuate my awful arms by stretching an elastic band across my bicep. I put this away for a while as I thought I'd never wear it. After snipping the elastic in the arms, I like it a lot and have worn (and washed) it five or six times with no issue."
4.0,Not bad for the price.  A bit smaller than I had hoped.
4.0,"This dress is really well made and looks beautiful on. I wore it for a night out with my husband and got lots of compliments. I am 5'9&#34; and normally a size 6. I bought this in small and it fits well but is VERY short, so I wore it as a long shirt with skinny jeans. Still very cute!"
4.0,"The size chart says a 42"" chest is a Medium size.  A 42"" would be my perfect size if it remains a 42"" size after being washed.  The 42"" size was too tight for me straight out of the packaging without ever being washed & I could not get my hands out of the buttoned sleeves.  Returning it for an XL.  Other than size claims being wrong, it's a nice shirt.  I like being able to zip it; but, the zipper handle is on my body's left left side which is typical for a woman's shirt, not a man's shirt."
4.0,"I liked this well made bag, but the opening is not as big as I need. I have lots of stuff! So the bag itself is big enough, but not the opening, which cuts out some space. Color was as pictured, very glossy, pretty bag and far as I can tell, made well."
4.0,A little bigger then expected
4.0,"It's a little less slouchy than the photograph depicts, but that may be due to my extremely thick hair. Overall, it's great quality and really warm! I'll be wearing this hat a lot this winter!"
4.0,"Good and sturdy material, not quite big enough to be a laptop bag. All in all though this was a great buy."
4.0,"I love these boots, so comfy"
4.0,"Surprised that it's long enough. Im 5'10, 195lb and its dragging on me. In one of the pictures I have on 3 inch heels and it's still touching the floor. I normally wear a large but got an xl. Nice fit.  Not too tight or too loose."
4.0,"Very pretty bracelet... Nice quality,  Bought for my daughter and she really likes it.. Came quickly"
4.0,My fiance love this ring. We wanted something stylish but durable that can handle the kind of work he does. This met both of those requirements. It looks better in person!!
4.0,Simple yet sharp looking cuff links. Was pleasantly surprised at the packaging that they arrived in - a small box with a wipe for keeping them clean!
4.0,"Gave 4 stars because the run smaller than they should and didnt return because my granddaughter was so excited that she used them anyway. They are very cute,cozy and very comfortable so even they are a little bit small she loves them. Go up a size or two because they do run much smaller."
4.0,Cut and glued theses to the bottoms of old rubber duck shoes.  Worked very well.
4.0,If you have a fat face or fat head then these are for you. My head is big and these sunglasses are almost too large for me. They fit great and work great.
4.0,"5'7"" about 150 lbs. Purchased a large. Fit just right. Fabric does not stretch at all. I returned it because you can't wear a normal bra with it without it showing in the back. The back is completely open down to about waist line. Also, the dress buttons down the front for decoration only. It did not come up in the front when I tied the belt around it. This dress does not wrap at all. It was very bland looking."
4.0,Too exact
4.0,"I needed a tank top to wear under a sheer shirt and this fit the bill nicely. A size medium, it fits with stretch on my 36- bust. It stays firmly in place. It's a solid color, not too sheer. It's just long enough. There is no adjustable straps and no shelf or cup support. However, I wasn't expecting that. It's just a basic black tank top. I recommend it for sleeping, working out, or for underneath something sheer."
4.0,Super comfy PJs!!! Only negative is the collar gets deformed after washing it several times. I hang dried too to try to preserve the shape. I would buy again though. Very soft!!!
4.0,"GOOD FIT, PRICE RATHER HIGH."
4.0,just a tad small for my liking
4.0,"These have been great with one glaring exception. While sledding, snowball fighting, and general snow fun, the nose peice fell out. I didn't notice it until the end of the day. I like the different lenses and all but they are sort of pointless if you have to glue the nose peice in-order to not lose the thing. The company was great and sent a replacement pair."
4.0,"Pretty necklace, it was a little longer than expected but looks great!"
4.0,"I really liked these.  I bought them for a costume and was surprised at their quality and softness.  My only complaint is that they miiiiight actually be real fur, not fake fur as it states in the product description.  I don't have a problem with real fur but others might."
4.0,nice classy watch
4.0,The quality was there
4.0,"This is cute and useful.  Looks nice on my dresser and is very stable.  It's a little smaller than I had anticipated but the measurements were on the site so shame on me for not reading carefully, however, I do like it."
4.0,They work well.  My glasses frequently slide off my nose.  The strap keeps them on my face.
4.0,"Cute! I'm 140 and 5'2...34D- a little tight in the bust area, but works"
4.0,"These are super cute and tiny although I was hoping the stud would be a little shinier but so far, its day 1 and I really like them"
4.0,Arrived in a timely manner and was nicely packed.  Easy set up and was able to use right away.
4.0,"I purchased this dress for a costume (Blossum from Power puff girls), but it had to go back because it was too large.  I will likely order it in a different color for the future as it was a really nice dress.  Order 1-2 sizes down as the dress is a little stretchy and should be form fitting.  I would have made this work but it wasn't just baggy in the waist, it was loose as heck in my bust area as well.  I followed the size chart exactly, and it was about 2 inches too big everywhere.  I measured myself right after trying the dress on and compared it to the size chart and I was spot on in what I ordered, it was just way off.  I have a 35 in waist, and the chart says I should get an XXL, but that is completely wrong.  I was able to pull the waist about 5-6 inches away from my skin.  I think the XL might fit ok, but I think I'll try the Large next time due to the stretch, I think the XL would be loose in some areas and this dress should show off my curves due to the way it's cut and the stretch of the fabric."
4.0,face is smaller than expected but price is great
4.0,These are made for very wide feet. Hard to keep them on.
4.0,"My son loves it. Very shear, breathable"
4.0,La correa es muy tiesa y no da buena horma en el brazo
4.0,What does fit have to do with it?
4.0,Loved this oversized shirt....dresses up any pant/jeans
4.0,This is quite comfortable and I love it. I am giving it four stars because it is quite large around my neck and it takes effort to get it tight
4.0,It was what I expected for the price I payed.  Great for cosplay.
4.0,So cute and fits well doesnt lose any color
4.0,Like the look alittle narrow and very thin sole.
4.0,"I am 5'3&#34; 138lbs, curvy hips and larger bust. I ordered a small and love it. The pockets hit at just the right spot. Fabric is wonderfully comfortable. I will be ordering it in another color."
4.0,Super flashy/blingy and perfect for an upcoming fitness competition. Not super light but not extremely heavy either. Will be wearing for a short time anyway. Wish the backing was a bit more substantial but I have others from other earrings I plan on using. These are very pretty earrings sure to get you noticed. Not for everyday wear of course ;)
4.0,"I love this bag's design, but it's not a heavy duty one. Definitely not top quality look with two types of material... top section is more canvas looking with just a touch of sheen. Bottom section and strap covers resemble store bag material since this section is not as tightly woven and has less sheen than the flower section. Nice EMBROIDERED LOOK, but not really embroidered.  It is PERFECT for LIGHT USE as an extra bag for work. NOT for HEAVY-DUTY. I would not rely on it for heavy items like books. I really like it though since it serves what I need and is not expensive"
4.0,Beautiful and comfy but tan much smaller in the chest
4.0,Love the fit and the look!!!
4.0,"These are ok. They come unceremoniously packaged, literally in a cheap plastic sleeve thrown into an amazon envelope. They’re ok in terms of quality. I wish they came with some kind of sharpening tool or cleaning pic. Because I use them on other areas besides eyebrows (ears, hairline, face), I will definitely need a new set soon. Probably will switch back to disposable ones for cost and effectiveness."
4.0,They are soft and comfortable but tend to ride up my legs.
4.0,I agree with the other review.<br />2 pair are a little smaller even though they<br />are marked medium
4.0,"Beautiful but didn't realize the only way to hold the blouse on is the ties at the top.  Material is a bit thick to tie properly, but still looks nice."
4.0,"I bought these for the Dude Perfect show. X-small for my almost 4year old. His shirt fits my 9 year old. The medium shirt fits my 12 year old. No matter though, they wore them anyway and the colors are great. The material is silky like a jersey."
4.0,Just did not like the way it looked on me. It was pretty.
4.0,It fit somewhat small in the bust area but otherwise it's a super cute dress can't wait to wear it again.
4.0,It's a very nice necklace but it would be better if it was a little longer.
4.0,Very pretty... given as a gift and the receiver loved them
4.0,"Fits well, beautiful color, not crazy about the material..."
4.0,I really wanted a blue sapphire starfish ring & this one is the perfect shape & size! It's pretty and fun. My only complaint is the color is lighter and more sparkly than pictured. It looks like CZs.
4.0,Pretty and affordable. Good enough for every day wear. Looks as though it will last quite a few wearing.
4.0,Ordered these for my son. The pattern is really cute. They fit him really well. He doesn't like them though. THey have a filter pocket and are easy on the ears. Wish my son liked them more.
4.0,"I am not really sure about the arch support as a four year old cannot really tell you that his arch feels supported well or not, but otherwise he loved them and loved having his own bowling shoes. We had him wear 2 pair of socks first because of the extra width, but he didn't like that and was fine wearing just one pair and having them a little loose."
4.0,"I'm loving these sandals! Goes well with so many things too. They are very comfortable and highly adjustable. The traction is very, very good too ... maybe a bit too good when I'm driving a car. That's the only negative thing I can think of to say about them. The soles tend to stick to the car mat and move it around, which isn't the safest feeling when driving. I haven't gone hiking in these, and probably won't because I'm in rattlesnake country, but if the car mat is any indication, they should do a great job of finding traction wherever you go. They didn't give me any blisters either."
4.0,"I needed a dress to play Hero in a period adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing. A very feminine and classy character. Being a plus-sized actress, I was determined to find one I felt good being on display in. This one shipped so fast (tried dress Lily first - won't make that mistake again). Not an absolutely perfect fit, roomy in the shoulders and the waist wasn't quite what I'd wanted. But still. Such an easy, comfortable, yet sturdy feel. Just enough stretch. I still needed a good shapewear top to avoid back fat, but around the front and waist it was nicely fitted and flattering. *Our costumers added the little band of fabric to the bottom hem and some shoulder pads, but no other alterations were made*.<br /><br />As somebody who hasn't always felt beautiful, especially in the theater world, I was SO grateful for this little number."
4.0,"It says 3X but it for my 11 yr old and it fits him just a little on the big side , it's like a 3X in a kids size if there was such thing."
4.0,"nothing nicer for comfort than a trapeze lounger!  this is a nice one for the money esp.  love the colors!!  Big on top for me, but I got me a needle and thread and pleated the front on the top!<br />Whallah, perfect! washes well, hang to dry. just rinse out in sink is enough."
4.0,"Very pretty. I love the clasp extenders, and the bracelet is the perfect size for me without the extensions. Has not tarnished. Only complaint I have is that it causes my wrist to itch  if worn for extended period of time. I have not yet figured out what I am having a reaction to. If you have sensitive skin like I do, be mindful."
4.0,Great hat even greater color
4.0,"Super cute romper! However, it was way too loose for me in the front. Might work better for others. Wish this worked for me! I am 5'0 and 118lbs for reference."
4.0,I bought these to match my reading glasses frames and I loved it!
4.0,I have the feeling this is made as a men's sweatshirt because it's big and the sleeves a extra long.  But I like it.  At least it's not skimpy and small
4.0,A little smaller than I thought but love the phone pocket and long strap
4.0,"I really like the hat.  I have an average to small head and it fits nicely, with adjustable Velcro tabs at the back.  Very cute and the fabric and flowers are nice quality.  My only problem is the intentional distressed look - which I don’t mind to a degree, but the tears on the visor are distracting."
4.0,Felt light and secure.<br />Insert increase protection.<br />Use all the time.<br />Thanks for a great product.
4.0,It would be better as a magnet.  I gave it as a gift.
4.0,This doesn't stay charged long
4.0,Great fun product as well as very usable
4.0,Price is a little high for one pair of socks
4.0,It's cute and what I wanted. Only wish it was a flowy at the bottom like the picture portayed it to be. The price was high for a t-shirt in my opinion.
4.0,The dress is beautiful and well made. It's just a little too tight and not the greatest style for me. I carry weight in my stomach and usually wear an XL on top. Sometimes a 1X. The size XXL just didn't work for me. I WISH. Beautiful.
4.0,Only tried it on so far.  It fits comfortably can't wait to wear it.
4.0,"On the cheap side, but great fir my RBG costume."
4.0,This beach cover up is attractive with a rich jewel tone color and soft fabric. It doesn’t wash and dry as well as I hoped.
4.0,"Very soft and lightweight. Weird fit makes the fabric come towards you when you breathe in, but isn't uncomfortable or stifling."
4.0,This is kind of uncomfortable and the Velcro makes it loud.
4.0,Pros first one that came in perfect<br /><br />Cons 2nd one warped and cracked
4.0,Love it better as a dress! Lol
4.0,"Quality is great! Love the dress! Be cautious when ordering size, I read reviews and ordered a size too big. I think it is safe to say it is true to size and that you should order in your actual size."
4.0,"Bought this band as a replacement for a Citizen Eco-Drive. Slightly longer than the original. But otherwise exactly the same.<br /><br />One note, the spring bars that come with this strap are slightly shorter than the originals. One side did not fit as well as the other. I would recommend holding on to the original spring bars."
4.0,Cute but a little too clingy for my liking
4.0,I love this shirt! But! As soon as I tried it on the button at the neck flung right off..for the price I don't mind buying another though. I also wish it came in way more colors than the 3 shown I'd buy them all.
4.0,I love the shoe - but it is snug compared to my other Easy Spirit shoes.
4.0,"Firstly I want to say its a pretty detailed and well made pendant. The size is pretty good, it's too large to be a ring but not so big that it's clunky. The pendant itself is pretty light. One of the things I don't like is the chain doesn't match the pendant (The chain is a much lighter white silver typical of jewelry while the gate itself is a dark silver). Another is some of the edges are still left from clearly being made in a mold. its not apparent but they could be sharp/scratchy."
4.0,I Love The Design Of The Overalls But I Wish That The Material Were Thick Jean Like Other Then Being Paper Thin. I Ordered A Size Bigger And It Fits Perfect Around My Hips But A Bit Too Baggy. For Any Tips I Would Recommend Wearing A Thick Shirt Under These Or A Jacket If Chilly Out. But Its Perfect For Warm Weather. 80/100
4.0,Nice material. Has great static cling... And is very fluid .  ..flowy...nice...
4.0,"Nice look, but runs small."
4.0,No complaints very fashionable. I got a lot of compliments
4.0,"Very hard to get on my daughters feet, but they are extremely light weight and seem to be comfortable for her"
4.0,It's much bigger than I expected and the color and quality is great! I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.
4.0,"I got a lot of compliments on this mask. It is very well made with metal as the butterfly, which made it a little heavy but a beautiful mask.i would recommend."
4.0,"Received item today, fabric has a good amount of stretch. I'm a size 12-14 and 5 '1' the XL fit me well with some stretch still available. I could lose 2 inches from the hem or it'd b fine with high heels... I'd get in another color if available."
4.0,I love this wallet. Just the right size for me and my important things. It did have a bit of a chemical smell (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) when I received it but 2 days and its gone. I'm trusting the company that the RFID really works as I do not have a way to test it.
4.0,"I do like it but I wish it wasn't almost 40 dollars.  Its very light, it works, it just feels like it could be 10 dollars less.  Or 5?"
4.0,"My wife liked the gown very much and I liked the value.  (She usually buys more expensive nightgowns.)  She did say it was of nice quality but it shrunk somewhat, which is not uncommon for flannel.  However, it took longer to arrive than both Amazon and the supplier said it would.  They sent it by USPS which had no problem getting it to Seattle but it sat for several days 15 miles away in the mail distribution center.  I wish the supplier would use Fedex ground instead."
4.0,"We bought this to look like old-fashioned sleepwear for my 12 year old to wear in a play. It worked great for the role, but she also likes wearing it to bed because it is soft and comfortable. It's not ""cool"", but it's pretty and nice quality."
4.0,Not soft.  Loved the colors!
4.0,They are perfect for gym
4.0,I really love this dress. It fit true to the size chart. My only complaint is that the v-neck sort of flops open if you lean over so I had to put a couple stitches in it. Other than that it was exactly what I was looking for and would definitely buy again.
4.0,"Ordered these shoes because I love the brand and have owned several other styles.<br />The price was pretty reasonable even though they charged a delivery fee.  When I received the shoes I was pretty happy. They looked great.  I am a size 9 with open toe shoes and an 8.5 with closed.  I ordered the 9.<br />So, I will tell you they were more of an 8. If you are a size 9 and like to have some room near the heel, these will not work.  If you like your feet right at the end you should be good to go.<br />I requested a return and the seller approved but be advised you will have to pay for the return shipping."
4.0,It is slightly smaller than the one I bought at the concert. But I do love this tanktop so I'm happy I found it!
4.0,These are very lose fitting.
4.0,"Very nice bracelet, I hope Grandma likes it!!"
4.0,"Easily the most comfortable swimming shorts I've worn and the liner is perfectly designed for maintaining the goods.  The color fades quickly on the stripes, but they still look good."
4.0,"I purchased it as a gift, she was very pleased!"
4.0,"I wanted a written contract with this,  sent with the gift , I have to now get a paper copy and sent it to the person I bought it for . Not happy!"
4.0,"Loved them, a little bigger than I thought, but gave them to my mom for Mother's day"
4.0,"I was very happy to see these offered.  I've had an extra pair of Bolle Vigilante sitting around with just one nose pad.  The pads were re-glued once before.  However, the left one fell off, and I lost it.<br />When the new set came I noticed that they were slightly smaller than the originals.  Since I didn't have a lot of choice, I pulled off the remaining pad, and saved it in the package that the new pads were sent in.  Then came the decision on what kind of glue to use.  After a lot of looking around I settled for Loctite ""Vinyl, Fabric, & Plastic - Flexible Adhesive"". It's transparent.  I let the glue dry overnight before trying the sunglasses on.<br />Surprisingly, the slightly smaller pads worked just as well as the originals.  I though that, being smaller, they would put the sunglasses closer to my face.  The reason I'm mentioning this is because the Bolle Vigilante sunglasses fit very close to the eyes, anyway.  It can be irritating if one's eyelashes are constantly making contact with the lenses.  I don't know if anybody else has ever had that problem with close fitting sunglasses.  I have.  So, I thought I'd bring it up just in case there was any concern about these slightly smaller pads.<br />All in all, I'm totally pleased that Amazon is presenting these for Rally Tennis. The only reason I don't give the product five stars is because there is no glue, or even gluing information, enclosed with the product."
4.0,Great for price...super comfy....too bif though.. ordered a small ended up selling them to a friend who is medium and they fit her perfect!!
4.0,"It's a little larger than I expected, not as delicate looking in person. But it is very pretty still, and the chain is pretty."
4.0,Runs a half size big.
4.0,Glasses are ok. Didn’t really fit my nose and was fogging up during my ride.
4.0,I've lost several earings due to the mask requirement. I've had these earing for a few months and wear them daily. I have not lost one earing :)
4.0,"I’m 5’8” 130 lbs. I normally wear a size small. This shirt is great quality material, but it just fits me a little weird. I normally like a longer than average shirt because I have a long torso. But this is a bit too long. And it has these kinda slits in the sides that go pretty high. I love the color. I’d say it’s a bit brighter than pictured, and I love it."
4.0,Pretty motif and very inexpensive.
4.0,"I like the look, build quality, foldability, and most of all that it's washable. I was looking for a hat to wear hiking that I wouldn't have to worry about getting dirty/sweaty and this fits the bill. The problem I have with it is finding the right size has been frustrating. The medium was way too small, the large still too small, and the extra large too big (though I kept it because it's still wearable and a good hat otherwise). Do yourself a favor and get the extra large unless you are seriously tiny."
4.0,Larger than expected so needed to add more gifts!  Shape is a bit clunky but the lights look good.
4.0,Pretty and nice colors. Very large and heavy.
4.0,"It looks a bit bigger than expected, but it is very pretty and confortable"
4.0,bought for daughters room she likes it. and the package it came in smelled wonderful
4.0,"LOVE THE DRESS, WILL HAVE TO WEAR LEGGINGS OR CAPRIS...KINDA SHORT"
4.0,Love it very well made
4.0,Wash up well
4.0,They were a hit with my grandson. Material is a bit light weight but fit nicely.
4.0,Beautiful too size runs small
4.0,It's not bad. You get exactly what the description says. The band is a little small.
4.0,"Literally my only complaint is that it is extremely long. I’m 4’10” so I’m used to things being long but it’s so long that I will definitely need to get it gemmed, heals won’t help unfortunately. Thankfully as a breastfeeding momma I can nurse in it no problem. If it wasn’t so long I would give it 5 stars"
4.0,"A fairly good fit with the xxl for me.  The material is a bit thin, so I wouldn't wear this without an undershirt.  But a completely functional button-up shirt."
4.0,the ring is beautiful but I had to return it because I can't wear plated jewelry
4.0,Excellent fast and secure
4.0,this tie bar that i bought as a present for my husband is very nice it makes his shirts look so neat it has a classic look to it the service and delivery from this company was excellent thanks amazon.
4.0,"Flattering fit, runs small."
4.0,An inexpensive way to enjoy dressing up for a special party.
4.0,"nice, as expected would recommend."
4.0,This one is better than the last one I bought.
4.0,Comfortable! Soft!
4.0,My goddaughter loved it. Was perfect for what she was looking for.
4.0,They are unexpectedly too big.
4.0,"Cute! Ears easy to attatch, nose too, but had to find own way to attatch tail."
4.0,This shirt is good quality and cut nicely.  A little long but great for every day with jeans or leggings.  The color was a little off from the picture.  I expected it to be more of a mauve color and it was almost coral (more pink that purple).
4.0,"Great sun hat! Folds down flat easily for travel. I have the tan with floral accents, which are just the right amount to give a little personality to the hat."
4.0,"Very nice wallet that seems well made; soft textured leather on the outside and inside of flaps is either leather or synthetic (not sure which) and fabric within the zippered area.  There's plenty of card slots within the double snap flap and the zippered pocket contains a zipper coin slot.  Especially like that the strap attaches to a small grommet hole separate from any zipper.  I like everything about this wallet except the size - it's just a bit to long, wide and thick for what I was wanting.  If it wasn't for the size, it would be a 5 star rating, but instead I will be returning it and continuing to search for something just a bit smaller."
4.0,Took a little bit longer to receive than normal but the bracelet is cute and decent quality
4.0,Cute shirt. Good fit. Comfortable.
4.0,Pretty decent dress but fits pretty loose. Im 5'3 112lbs and got the small.
4.0,"I'm giving this 4 stars just because I have not yet worn/washed this, so can't speak to how it will hold up.<br /><br />I just received my mustard-color cardigan, and I am so pleased with it!  The color is great, sort of a matte gold (in case you wondered where on the &#34;mustard&#34; spectrum it falls.  Not French's Yellow Mustard.).<br /><br />I am 5' 9&#34;, 160 pounds, usually wear a 10 or 12.  I'm not small-breasted.  I ordered the Large, and was worried it might be too small, but it fits perfectly.  Falls right to my hips, not tight around, including across the bustline, and the sleeves are the right length.  The button detail on the sleeves is nice, and so unexpected at this price.  It is thin, which is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />I will definitely order more of these when I need cardigans, especially in hard to find colors!"
4.0,"Cute thin sweater, but they do run a little larger and stretch easy. I’d go a size smaller if I knew. I purchased a small, but wished I had purchased and XS"
4.0,"This is a really cute necklace. It looks almost exactly like the TARDIS from Doctor Who.<br /><br />While I'm not downrating for the green gem on top of the light (especially since it's my favorite color) or the fact that there's no visible &#34;door&#34; or door sign since it's just a regular police box and not specifically THE TARDIS, I did have to downvote for the fact that the bottom of the necklace is not seated properly so it doesn't really have a square bottom. One side of the bottom piece sticks out in one corner. So it ends up looking like this \ \ instead of this |  | but a little less pronounced.<br /><br />However, I really do like the necklace as a whole and it came with a good quality, long chain. I painted mine TARDIS blue. :)"
4.0,These belts are definitely cute and make a statement!
4.0,Dress is cute and fits as expected.  I'm 5'1'' and 125 lbs.
4.0,Really like this product. I wanted a front pocket wallet and this fits the bill. Wish it could handle a little more cash on the money clip.
4.0,"the only reason why I didn't give this 5 starts is because after about 5 months of owning this, one of the diamonds fell out and the golds starting to look old and cheap, I'm sure there's methods to fixing that though.. Other then that I've only worn it about 6 times and every time I do I get compliments left and right, my girlfriends are always making me take it off so they can try it on.. It's definitely unique and that's why I love it"
4.0,"The cover-up itself was beautiful material, and looked great. Issue was it didn't fit me at all - the medium completely swallowed me and I'm not sure the problem would have been solved by ordering a small or xsmall. I think this isn't really meant for someone that is petite - but not sure because I didn't try the smaller sizes. I'm 5'3&#34;, 148 lbs, 36DD for a reference point. But all in all, if I was tall like the model in the picture, I would have reordered the small or extra small and spent the money on this because it's gorgeous."
4.0,Great dress but husband did not like chocolate color.
4.0,It is what it is. Made from fairly heavy duty cloth and feels authentic. Will easily roll up or fold to fit in your pocket. I like it cause it is bigger and easier to spot if you're looking for your keys.
4.0,It looks like an adorable outfit. Product came promptly. Everything looks great and ready for gift giving. Will know in one month if it is a quality product!
4.0,"I live in a colder climate region during the winter months and need products that can keep my son's feet warm (even though they are marked as a 'girls' product, you wouldn't know once they are on his feet). These Uggs provide the perfect amount of warmth for my his feet while we are out and about. The only issue I have, and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is they tend to fall off easily. Other than that, would definitely purchase these again - if I needed too! The durability and lasting quality is top notch."
4.0,lucen  muy  bien
4.0,"Excellent watch for the price, truly classic looking.  However the watch band was not what I though it would be (in looks) so I did replace it with a black silicon band and it looks very good.  All in all a very good buy!"
4.0,I'd give them a higher rating but the sizing runs a bit small. Wicks away moisture.
4.0,It fit great and I got an xL because I have 36D breast so I think if your a bit bigger in that around get larger
4.0,Got this for my mother. She seemed to love it. Size and item was as expected.
4.0,Perfect fit and lightweight. No pockets is only downside.
4.0,"I bought this as a birthday present for one of my Granddaughters, her favorite color is Purple and second favorite is Pink, this was a perfect present for her!  Now she is warm and cozy and pretty in Pink and Purple!!  Very well made coat and she will get a lot of use here in Maine this winter."
4.0,"I really really wanted a fabric band.  I work with horses, and I sweat a lot.  The band is good quality and hasn't gotten dinged up yet (I've had it about a month).  I wear it all the time, except at night.  The band does sometimes get a funky odor, and my skin doesn't always dry out, so I try to leave it off while driving or sitting for long periods.  This seems to help.  I haven't taken the band off my fitbit since I got it, so I can't speak to how well it goes on and off."
4.0,Love it.. fits very well
4.0,These were bought for an all white party.  They were comfortable and fit well.  They seemed well made as well.
4.0,This product is beautiful but it runs a little small I love the corset but order a size bigger than you think you need it does unlace to a just more :) I recommend this product it is stunning
4.0,But not so good on wrist
4.0,"if your looking for a nice cross-body purse this could work for you.  I like it the only problem I have with it is the center pocket, I can't put anything in it."
4.0,Haven't worn yet but they are really cute and fit well
4.0,"I like the shoes, I normally wear a size 10 but in these I could have worn a 9.5. I am going to keep the size 10 because they are comfortable."
4.0,nice and stretchy very cute goes really nice with straight tube skirt.
4.0,removed the combs. they did not sit/fit well on my 3 year olds hair
4.0,"I love it, it's the right size for me but at times I have problems with the zipper."
4.0,"I had thought this was going to be a sweat shirt, but it is not of the material expecting."
4.0,Nice hat. Bought a Large for my 22⅞ in.  head and the fit is spot on. Can't wait to break it in on some summer hikes soon.
4.0,"This is very cute--for an outdoor party, summer dinner, date night or girls night out.  I loved the photo but questioned whether it might look a bit cheesy because of the unique deign or poor quality construction.  Neither is true.  From young to old, tuck in blouse or topped with a sweater, this is AWESOME.  The only downside is the ""one ixd"" only option.  It stretches a lot, but at a size 14 it was 2 inches too small in the waist.  So up to a 10-12 go for it.  [ockets, nice fabric, well made, and super fun."
4.0,"Purchased as a gift for my daughter. Haven't given it to her yet, but purple is her favorite color so I'm sure she will love this item. Seems fairly hardy, great price. Would recommend."
4.0,High quality. Just as pictured. Please read sizing.  Bought an XL for my daughter who usually wears adult L. Entirely too small. I'd really guess the XL is more like an adult size 6-8.
4.0,I love the fit & feel so I bought 3.<br />It is nice & soft & light material will b great for spring & summer weddings or other special occasions.
4.0,These glasses are definitely good for the price.  The plastic seems durable and the lenses have a nice gloss.  I got the yellow/green glasses and the color of the actual glasses is a bit darker.  The glow in the dark is cool but it is not a very strong glow.  Nevertheless these glasses are great for the small price.
4.0,"This item looks great on however, it is very thin. I thought it would be thicker since the hooded area looked heavy. Other than that, the shirt gave what was supposed to be given."
4.0,arrived quickly and as advertised.  The necklace is really long!
4.0,"Very stylish, especially at this price!"
4.0,Very nice and received in a timely manner
4.0,For the low price it's beautiful and light. Great conversation starter to witness the Blessed Sacrament. I wear it on my blazer or dress shirt.
4.0,My daughter is on the smaller side and it fits her perfect . I would say petite fit
4.0,Not the best looking glasses but they work. They do reduce the glare off water surface giving ability to see down below.
4.0,Seria que el producto no fuera muy ancho
4.0,"Love them! Very nice, but run a bit small."
4.0,I really like this bag. It has an adjustable strap and is comfortable to wear. The brown color is great and the fabric seems durable. One downside for me is the closure. The Velcro is positioned incorrectly so it doesn’t stay closed as well as I would like. I think over time this misalignment will cause fraying of the fabric from the rubbing of the Velcro in it. Otherwise it’s a great value for the price.
4.0,"Not as indestructible as it describes. My 9month old, 46lb, lab mix puppy chewed the rim off in a day of giving it to her. Smells terrible right out of the bag. Smells goes away after a few washings. I was hoping she wouldn’t be able to destroy this one but it looks like she will. I have tried multiple indestructible toys for her but so far nothing has lasted long. If you have an average chewer it should last you a while but thinking aggressive chewers not so much."
4.0,"After suffering through several winters performing work outdoors making do with whatever clothing I had in my closet, I decided this year I was going to be warm! I was initially looking for a nice pair of insulated coveralls when I came across these. I'm glad I chose these over coveralls because if I get too hot I can always shed my jacket as needed. The material is durable and they are very comfortable to wear all day. There is a small rip in the crotch now after a couple months of use but if they last through the end of winter I'll be happy. The snap closures are not integrated very well and three of them have come off completely. Not a huge deal since there are decent quality zippers."
4.0,Thin good for driving
4.0,"Inside seam can be annoying to adjust, but over all really comfortable"
4.0,Love these.  Wish they made more varieties of them.  My only downside is that I lost two of them within a few hours.  You will need to either glue them in (I really don't want to put glue on my magic band) or find a way to make sure they stay.  I would only buy them again if and when I find a good way to keep them intact.
4.0,The hat came as advertised but was a bit too small for my husbands head.
4.0,It was nice except the little dots will block your teeth in photos.  So wear above the mouth area.
4.0,This little magnet makes my life so much easier. I am complemented on it all the time. The magnet is very strong and it helps keep my glasses out of harms way.
4.0,"Perfect boots for my son, fit well and looks nice on Sundays for church this winter season"
4.0,"A bit short, but I knew that from reading other reviews. Pairs great with tights and boots for the winter, or with strappy sandals for the summer. Will be buying this in every color!!"
4.0,"I like these tie bars. They are not very tight or hold 100% well, but they get the job done. Look pretty good and colors are not bad."
4.0,"Great quality, love them to drive my motorcycle at night, perfect fit, thank you."
4.0,"Super soft & comfy, but fine than expected."
4.0,"Good pair of sunglasses, a little large for my face but my husband was way excited...we are going to leave them in the car for a backup pair (nice to have).  Nice case to keep them in so less likely to get scratches."
4.0,"A good product for someone who wars socks all the time.  Just enough non skid surface, material is soft, washable."
4.0,I loved the hat. Only think I would change is making the googles removable.
4.0,Cute but runs 2 sizes too big
4.0,"Love this product, except for the fact that the buckle/lock lands in the middle of the body of the suitcase. With the beating that bags take from baggage handlers I think this is a poor place for for the buckle and lock. I think all the manufacturer has to do is make the buckle strap adjustable so that one can place it at the top of the bag near the handle, or even at the bottom of the suitcase if one so wishes. I had to return mine for this reason, since I do not think the buckle is sturdy enough to take all the forces it would be subject to in that position. The strap itself seems very sturdy."
4.0,The zipper is a little difficult without help. Overall this jumpsuit is comfortable and looks great.
4.0,Nice and good looking
4.0,"Color wasn't as brilliant as the picture, but still a pretty bracelet for pre-teen girl."
4.0,"Very nice, but smaller than I expected."
4.0,I give this to my sister in law as gift
4.0,My only complaint is it could use a few more alarms on it for potty training or some kind of reminders.
4.0,"I don't normally buy clothing items online, but considering I was going to Mexico in the beginning of February, there aren't a lot of options in stores at that time. I read the reviews carefully and decided to get the Small (0-2). I am 120 pounds, 5' 6"". B cup size. The top fit great. It had good coverage, and the padding inside gave a very nice silhouette and even a slight lift I think. It feels very secure on. Since I was going to Mexico for my husband's work conference, I wanted to make sure I had something more conservative and this was perfect.<br /><br />The bottoms - were too small. I don't have much of a butt and yet these were still pushing the cheeks out. I figured this when I bought it due to the other reviews. It was inexpensive enough and I liked the top so much that I just went out and bought some plain black bottoms that fit. I'll find a tinier friend to give the bottoms too and they can go get a cheap solid top."
4.0,Necklace is very thin. But i still love it. It was purchased as a temporary chain for a charm but i like it enough to keep wearing it after i get my other one.
4.0,"i bought this for my mom for her birthday and they aren’t the softest material ever but they are super cute on her and they fit just right. they’re not too baggy or too tight and the color is like the picture. i’m very picky about clothing and so is my mom so if your considering buying it, go for it. it’s a good price for the quality too"
4.0,Bought this to use on a Pandora bracelet. The fit was perfect.
4.0,Always good lenses. A little pricey but I can recommend it.
4.0,Light weight!  Excellent space.
4.0,"I wear a 9 and have a somewhat wide foot, but I can usually wear a 9 with no problems. These boots are a little bit tight on my foot and on my calf. I'm hoping they'll be comfortable after they're broken in, but it'll be annoying while they're new.<br /><br />They seem pretty durable. They don't look expensive, but they also don't look like they were bought at the dollar store. The soles are very thick, with big ridges. I think they'll work out alright, once I've broken them in."
4.0,"I'm getting married next month.  This is my second wedding; my parents paid for the first wedding (to an abusive jerk whom I later divorced) and this time around I didn't want to ask them to contribute to our costs for obvious reasons. Still, I wanted to get 'parents gifts' for my parents and I chose this for my dad.<br /><br />It is cute, but it certainly doesn't look like I broke the bank on it. I do like that each piece came wrapped in plastic film to avoid chipping/scratching from the other pieces. I like that it came with an adorable little gift box."
4.0,Only drawback is it's a little hard to hook but love the fit and support
4.0,"Size is as advertised, quality is great too!"
4.0,This is cover wells & is nice in the summer when offices have a/c blasting. The only thing that would make it better if the sleeves were 3/4 length. I thought a thin long sleeve cardigin would be fine but at times the love sleeves get too warm
4.0,Love this necklace! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the clasp on the chain broke and I couldn't find the pendant! But this was after about 8 months of being constantly worn so I will definitely get myself another!
4.0,"My friend bought a pack of these at a store one day for like $5. So to find 10 packs for about the same price is a great deal. I gave these out to the kids in my family for Christmas and they loved them. Of course, I kept a pair for myself!"
4.0,"It’s really nice looking and compact but I was hoping it would fit the standard pill bottles you get from the pharmacy. Sadly it doesn’t.  You must use the little bottles it came with. They are small clear bottles which can be refilled. I will use it but I feel much better having the pharmacy pill bottle on me to prove I have a legal prescription.  The box itself appears to be genuine Coach, it came with the usual inserts.  I just wish it was a bit bigger to fit the pharmacy bottles."
4.0,I like the hat. Only wish is was less floppy
4.0,Fits great and cute design. Did not realize the mid-section is white and the bottom section with stripes is off-white.
4.0,Runs large. (On me)should have ordered a size down.  But nice dress very glory and roomy
4.0,Very nice belt .. added an elegant touch .. received compliments for it
4.0,"Great looking tie and it is long enough with out shortening the blade too much.  There is a lot of give to the material so making a nice knot is no issue.  The material does have a few thread pulls in the back and at the bottom.  For the price, this is a good tie and I plan to buy another color or two, though the longevity of it is slightly questionable.  It does have a great style."
4.0,"They are very elegant, but the gold color is not as vibrant as the image shows."
4.0,Absolutely adorable! It holds pretty much everything and I am so glad that this was my first purse ever! The material is pretty sturdy and the space is rather spacious. It has a pocket on the inside and a zipper pocket as well. It opens up nicely. I love the design of the rabbit. So sassy!
4.0,"Very good items, different colors than advertised."
4.0,Strong and durable. Easy to identify anywhere. No issues in the 3 years I have used it.<br />Love it.
4.0,My bby looks great in it
4.0,The dress fits great aside from the straps. They are long and flimsy and not adjustable. I had to tie the straps together to keep my breasts from falling out of the dress the entire night.
4.0,I thought the material would be more like a denim but it’s a nice blue fabric.
4.0,I am 5'7 and its too long to wear flats but the quality is nice.
4.0,Gave it 4 stars b/c it came apart but I was able to put it back together.
4.0,Saddle is really wide. Flare is decent not too big not too small. They are true to size. They fit great and are comfortable. I like them both reverse and mother of pearl side out. The mother of pearl carvings look great almost identical to the pictures. I would recommend these. There were a few little things like glue showing and a small chip in flare but nothing big. As far as I can tell they are genuine too.
4.0,2X fit my husband perfectly.  It's nice and light.
4.0,"Keychain is very nice quality. Backside also features the character from the cover art, although he is a bit off center and his head looks a little weird. But I bought it for the title on the front, and that looks great. Recommended to all Bloodborne fans."
4.0,Looooooooooved It
4.0,"This was cute for my daughter to wear for the Superbowl. I liked the quality of the sweatshirt more than the pants, but overall was great and inexpensive for a 1 day event."
4.0,Its as in the picture only its too big for my face &#60;rolling my eyes&#62; it looks nice though. I wish it came in a box i have to be more careful of the scratches/damage :(
4.0,"The fit a tag more snug, but otherwise seem cute and comfortable. If you are wavering on sizes, go up one. I’d order more."
4.0,Poor quality. A loose sock means low compression. But the penguins are happy so I rate it highly
4.0,"Didn't hit me in the right spot for the bust or the hips, but for someone shorter it would be a cute dress. I'm 5'10&#34; and bought a Large."
4.0,Has little saying on it.. that made no sense!!
4.0,"The print is slightly off center. Other than that, it is a big mask and seeing as how I have a large beard it actually fits my face! Oh and also The filter pocket is kind of oddly shaped and you have to be conscious of where the filter is because it doesn’t really hold in any particular place, if that makes sense? But all in all super cool mask and comfortable, would I have preferred to be 100% cotton but definitely works as a great outer mask!"
4.0,"The shoe was great, the bow fell off in the first week but everything else was great"
4.0,This boot is pretty and well made for the price.  My only issue is that I have thick ankles and when I walk the boot digs into my ankles.  I wish I would have worn them around the house when they first arrived because now it's too late to return them.
4.0,"I love this skirt but it is shorter and less flowy than I expected. I am only 5’2 so when something is short on me, you know it’s short!"
4.0,"There are days the weathermen predict rain & it doesn’t always happen and other times no one predicted it and suddenly I get drenched.  Umbrellas are hard for me to handle with anything else, so this is easy to pack, weighs less than a good umbrella, and it works as long as I have the time /opportunity to get it on.  I do wish there was a button or tie or something to connect it inside to make it secure & not likely to move around.  The tie for the hood is great, needs something for under your clothes.  But bottom line it does the trick, glad I bought it."
4.0,"I bought these because I read they were recommended for people with hammertoes and I am hoping this is true. I was surprised how comfortable the toe posts are and that I didn't have any trouble becoming accustomed to them.  I wear a 7.5 in most street shoes (8.5 in running shoes) and the 8 just fit me.  I am only giving them 4 stars as they are a bit expensive for what they are and they are rather narrow.  My feet just fit in them and I would be happier with them if they were a touch wider, so if you have wide feet my guess is that these will not suit you."
4.0,"Everything is great with the belt, except I overlooked the fact the the belt was elastic. I missed that when I ordered it. Otherwise, it's good."
4.0,I like them only need smaller size 2.
4.0,"For the price, this is a steal! I love 5 out of the 6 pairs . . . I’d love all 6 but they accidentally sent me a size down in the white pair. Go figure the pair I was the most excited for lol."
4.0,"Cute shirt, just runs small"
4.0,"I was hoping to use these bells on my setter for upland hunting, but they are more of the Christmas holiday variety. They don't seem like they would fair very well on a dog's collar ambling through the brush. One never knows though."
4.0,"Nice dress, cute fabric. Love the pockets!"
4.0,This watch band is cute but I didn’t like the transparent look as much as I thought. It’s really good quality though and the print is very cute so it’ll just be something I get used to.
4.0,"I wish I hadn't followed the reviews on this item. This dress is super comfortable, well made, and would have been perfect, but I went up a size. This dress has a lot of stretch to the top as well! Will be returning this item for the small, I am 5' 105lbs."
4.0,"I liked the pattern of this dress. Really love the pockets. Bought a large because i always fluctuate between a 12 and 14. Would have given 5 stars if it fit correctly and wasnt past my toes.  I can recommend this for anyone over 5'7"". I'm  5-5"""
4.0,It’s not the same color as te picture but I like it.<br />I was wondering the same color:(<br />Anyways the product it’s nice
4.0,"I love the look of this dress and it is so comfortable too! It is a little on the thin side, in the skirt portion, but nothing a light slip can't handle."
4.0,It's pricey for what it is but it's pretty. I got it for my niece who';s obsessed with The Little Mermaid.
4.0,I love this bracelet. It is just my style.
4.0,Great cap/hat for everyday use.  Fits just like I wanted it to.
4.0,Great Halloween decoration. We've had it for 3 years and still use it. It's up on the wall as I type this. It's pretty big and realistic enough for a Halloween decoration.
4.0,"Had to do some adjusting with the sewing machine, but overall great. Wonderful for around the house wear-keeps the girls from getting chafed!!"
4.0,This is really a big wallet. It can handle any size of glasses. You can use it as a small purse also
4.0,"Cute little tennis shoes! I ordered a 13, which is my daughters normal shoe size. As soon as they arrived, they looked big to me, and sure enough - they do fit as though they run a size large. Just a notation to consider when ordering."
4.0,"Great packaging, easy to open and was nicely put together to keep the purse safe while shipping. No frays or bad kinks. Only thing I was surprised with was the texture of the purse was more loose than photos. All in all will look at Hynes Victory for future product purchases."
4.0,"I like the design and the color. I ordered a 36 waist which normally fits me a little loose. These shorts are little tight, but wearable."
4.0,"These are very thick and warm. Good compression, not easy to put on."
4.0,The leggings were soft and material was not as thick as my others. I loved the price. The regular were not plus and tends to run small
4.0,"Bottoms were a little tight, so I wear the top with shorts/skirts. Many compliments. I ordered a small. I am 5' 9&#34; 130lbs. No complaints other than the top blowing upwards, periodically."
4.0,Zip a bit stiff
4.0,"My shoe size is a 7.5 US Women's and these socks fit nicely. I'm sure they can fit feet that are smaller or larger without causing discomfort. The patters are very cute and the socks are soft and comfortable to wear. I'm usually picky about socks because I often find the toe seams uncomfortable. However, the seam runs across the top of the toes and doesn't bother me. The only minor complaint I have is that they could be a little thicker, but theybare great quality for their price!"
4.0,It’s a good belt but it does slip it’s hold sometimes if you’re being very active.
4.0,"Cute tank that’s so simple yet flattering. I’m usually a size M in tanks, sized up to L for a relaxed fit & so I can tie the front. Soft & comfortable. Interested in getting more colors."
4.0,"Good size with many pockets for storage. I wish it was a little wider & a little shorter, so that it could stand upright without falling over."
4.0,These are not the thickest sweatbands but work great for me under a hard hat to keep the sweat out of my eyes.  The thick sweat bands will hold more sweat but for me don't work very good under the hard hat.
4.0,The code is actually beautiful.<br />Ordered a large for extra movement in the coat.<br /><br />It had to jade for non-Americans it’s so stigmata and small and a 2XL was sold out
4.0,"it is a nice, but it was too small for my daughter and 2 months later i had to replace"
4.0,Fits more like a medium size.  I wear men's size 10 and the slipper is too snug.
4.0,"kind of longer than I expected and a little more snug than I would like, but overall it's good."
4.0,"The fabric is nice, a little warm in Texas heat, but very nice"
4.0,"Super cute rings, really thin which is what I wanted. The only reason I put 4 stars is because I had a shipping issue with amazon. But good quality rings they look just like the photo."
4.0,"Very nice handbag, however it a bit too heavy for everyday use."
4.0,Me gustaron porque son cómodas para usar
4.0,"I'm 6'2 295 - 54 Jacket and 38 waits, I usually get a XXL in everything this runs big<br />I returned for an XL which is perfect fit<br />Like it would have given 5 stars but fit is to big If your 295 with a big belly get the XXL...."
4.0,Perfect size purse for all my stuff. Not too bulky. Like the interior. The strap slides off my shoulder and is a little too stiff.
4.0,"Looks a little nicer in the photo, still beautiful. The tree is very slightly off center. It came accompanied with a necklace cord. Overall I am happy."
4.0,"I got it a a gift, it fitted just right for a 12 year old boy."
4.0,"The advantage is that it does not get dirty easily with waterproof and oilproof.<br />The disadvantage is that the apron is made of a slightly stiff material, and the h-line strap is also wide and stiff.<br /><br />The pocket in the middle of the apron is a furry material, and you have to wipe the water off hands on the pocket. Due to the material, it is a little thick and hot, but it is good to be resistant to water or oil."
4.0,"This worked great for standing outside on a rainy, windy day watching a golf tournament. I like the shade of pink. This is more suitable for someone taller than me (5’4”) because the sleeves were very long but I rolled them up and the mid-calf length of the coat helped keep the rain out. Very lightweight but kept me dry."
4.0,"This would not be the first pair of von zipper sunnies I have owned. That being said, the frame on these were a little wider than usual. I am afraid I won’t be able run with these on or they would fall off my face when I am sweating. Other than that they are fantastic sunglasses. The polarized lenses are amazing."
4.0,Very cool look; fits perfectly.
4.0,"I get complimented on these sunglasses all the time. I've bought a few pairs f these (I've lost/broken/scratched pairs). Only reason it doesn't et 5 stars is because the little screw on the side tends to fall out over time. But for $10 it's expected. I lose too many sunglasses to pay a lot for them, so these were perfect."
4.0,"Great fit.  Beautiful hat.  Disappointed that the band came off easily, but it can easily be tacked back into place."
4.0,These earrings look really nice and are lightweight. My complaint is that the posts are a little thick and give trouble going into my piercings. With a bit of work can force them but that makes them a little too much work if you are short on time.<br />Once in they fit fine and don't pull down one's ears if worn all day.<br />I was provided with this product via Amazon's Vine Program with no expectations but that I provide my honest opinion all thoughts expressed are my own.
4.0,"Not very warm, but still cool."
4.0,Very nice for the price. Easy to read time and date.
4.0,Good material.<br />Bad made no zippers.
4.0,"Fit well, comfortable, only the red was a little redder than it looks in the picture which isn’t really a bad thing. The print is also a little bit reflective with light which is why I rated it 4 Stars. Looks great with my purple doc martens!"
4.0,"We purchased these thinking they would be like the socks you get when you’re in the hospital. However these ran a little larger, and a little thinner so my mom didn’t like them. They also only have traction on one side which we didn’t realize until they arrived."
4.0,"look nice but very small ,  nice - overpriced by 50%"
4.0,"I have bought 6 pairs...if there were more colors , I'd buy 6 more."
4.0,Nice material. Perfect for casual walk or outing. The bottom design looks attractive but its loose and not like whats shown in the picture
4.0,I will always be a return customer with the WOOSEA brand clothing. Garments are made of quality material and I receive items quickly
4.0,Looks good on but I notice the stitching under arm is loose.  I will probably need to have a tailor restitch those
4.0,I purchased the jolie red in a small. It fit as it fit on the model (I'm 5'7&#34; and 130 lbs) so it was slightly loose. The material on this was thicker than I was expecting and it wasn't really ivory but more of like an ivory Heather background with taupe. Still like the shirt but I am giving it your stars because the material is a little itchy. A lot of these tops cost about 30-35 at boutiques and I'm happy I found a seller that actually sells similar stuff for a lot less! Will definitely purchase from them again!
4.0,Fun Halloween costume... great for cold weather otherwise it’s pretty hot... overall a cute costume
4.0,"I'll get to the but in a bit.<br /><br />First off, this watch is huge. 30 mm is a little over an inch. It also sits tall on your wrist. About a quarter inch or so. Can't measure it right now for you but that is part of the but I will get to later.<br /><br />Second off, the watch is beautiful. Not a huge chocolate fan, but it looks like you are wearing a milk chocolate Ghiradelli square on your wrist. And the contrasting shiny/dull band is most excellent. Not a fan of gold, so it's a nice way to give contrast<br /><br />Third off, setting the chronograph was a bit confusing for me as the directions were a bit muddled. I can't remember exactly how to set it. I would play with it to remind myself so I could tell you right now, but I can't, again part of the aforementioned but. I believe the date setting is altered in the second crown position and is rotated counter clockwise to adjust.<br /><br />Okay, now for the big but you have been so anxiously awaiting. I'm the type that always has my watch on. Showering, dishwashing, swimming, cycling, water balloon fights, you name it. This is why I made sure my watch could handle water. The watch is listed as ""water resistant 10atm"" which means ""A watch certified for 10 ATM (bar) can be used for snorkling and diving."" text grabbed from fancy watch site. This is where my watch lost points. I could take a shower with it on, it'd be fine; ride in humid weather, fog. Go swimming, fine; splashed on a water ride, fog. Even a water balloon fight made it fog. So, off to the Fossil store I went. Turns out, there was no rubber o-ring on the back of the case. They were good about getting it sent off for the o-ring and cleaning of the inside of the crystal. Yay, go Fossil. Bad news, I was told it could 3-5 weeks to get it back. Worse news, that 3-5 weeks starts AFTER the third party repair co. receives the watch. It took a week to get there. So i am looking at being without my brand new watch for up to a month and a half. Luckily, my Mum has a Timex that she never wears that she has given to me to use in the meanwhile.<br /><br />I gave a four star rating, but it's looks are really saving it here. If there repair company was part of Fossil, I'd be giving a 2 or 3 just for the wait time for repair."
4.0,The shoes are great. They have a fairly long battery life as well. The only thing was the remote did not work.
4.0,Fabric is slightly thinner than expected. Still looks very nice.
4.0,Adorable and do prevent slipping on hard wood floors..
4.0,"I guess I assumed the stones would be larger, given the price. But still a pretty necklace."
4.0,Good product small band
4.0,Kind of a weird material but still a pretty dress. The buttons make it so it's a little more risque than I would typically buy but for the price I guess you can't complain.
4.0,I have two...love them
4.0,"This was the second one that I ended up ordering...The first one was WAY to large...AND I'm short, so I ordered a smaller size...This one fit PERFECTLY....although I WILL be taking the padding out of the chest area...(I don't need it)....It's a BIT heavy material for a swimsuit, but everyone compliments me on how it fits, and flatters my figure.  I like how it hangs on my body.  I'm in my 60's now, and it seems to fit suit me quite well...I also LOVE the cute little bag it came in!  GREAT idea!  I wish I could have gotten another color, but black was all I could get in my size.  It is made quite well, and certainly will be a good suit for years to come!"
4.0,Cute tankini at a great price. The shelf bra fits kinda loosely but not bad.
4.0,Very nice but must wash first or it will shed.
4.0,They are just what I needed.  It saved me hundreds of dollars by not having to buy prescription sunglasses.
4.0,Really cute and fit as expected. The holes are a little bigger then I was expecting but that isn’t a big deal to me at all.
4.0,These are GREAT little skirts. The fabric is that smooth scuba-type material. I am a 28 waist 38 hips and the medium fit but not super tight. I probably could have gotten away with a tight small.
4.0,"Fit nicely. The only thing I don't like is the extra wire under the arms. Don't know why they're there, A little uncomfortable if worn too long."
4.0,"Bought this on a discount day and overall I'm happy with it. Some things to note is that it came dirty with a stain on one breast. Additionally, there is good padding on the top to cover nipples and keep shape, but the bottom half was lacking the right amount of padding to cover camel toe. I decided to keep this and wear with swim shorts to just wear as a top."
4.0,"Love the pants as they fit perfectly. However, they are a bit long and very shiny."
4.0,"Seem goes down the middle making you look like a conehead. Speakers shud be on the Ends of the main seam, not on the sides because of this."
4.0,ordered a large because of the reviews and was glad i did it fit like a small love the style and fabric color
4.0,Comfortable. I would have liked them to be thicker.
4.0,This dress is so cute and fits pretty well. I ordered a size up as most of the reviews clam it runs small I found that I would have been better off getting my true size. It will work it is just a little lose.
4.0,Great be product! Elementary kids loved it! Wish the blowers were more productive! Do not buy cheap batteries for this!
4.0,"They didn't really make it longer than three days on a rough-bottom pool, but they are a lot more comfortable to wear than bulky water shoes. the low price made it less painful when we had to throw them away."
4.0,Very nice simple and elegant formal. Looks like the photo. My only complaint is that it runs on the smaller side. Hopefully I can lose those few pounds before my special occasion or I may have to wear Spanx. Lol. Otherwise I love that the dress has a built in bra! Genius solution to difficult necklines. The color is a beautiful vibrant royal blue. The ruching is very flattering and the jewel accent on the keyhole neckline is very pretty. I will only need to wear earrings with this dress. It's also a very packable dress that won't take up room in any luggage.
4.0,"Nice item, same  as described.Thank you"
4.0,The black strap was too long. I didnt like how it hung on joggers so I cut it off. The joggers are very nice and comfortable
4.0,Very cute and easy beach cover-up!
4.0,They actually fit as described.......
4.0,"These hats are nicely designed and the material is of a nice quality.  There is a ""sweatband"" for your forehead and adequate length ties in the back.  The only negative about these hats are the size, they do run a bit large."
4.0,"We bought this for our son for Christmas. He loves it, but seeing as he's fairly tall (6""4""), this sweatshirt was slightly short in length and arm length. He still loves it however, for the colors and fact that it represents his fraternity."
4.0,Great bag! Overall I like the bag because it has plenty of pockets for stuff. The straps are a little stiff and uncomfortable however so I lowered one star.
4.0,Beautiful as pictured.  A little too small.
4.0,"I've purchased two 3-item sets for my three grandchildren (two girls 7 and 10 and a boy age 5). Out of the first set of 3 pair of goggles, the fastener on one pair broke after two swims in our pool (which includes lots of ""cannonball"" jumps by all three grandkids from the cantilevered pool deck). The fastener is plastic (not silicone like the goggles, nose piece, and straps), with an inset circle male end that ""snaps"" into the female receiver. The circle snapped off, making it impossible to secure the goggles. Had to trash that pair. On the second set of 3 pair of goggles, none so far have broken. On the bright side, the kids really like the goggles; they are quite comfortable once adjusted properly. They do occasionally leak a bit, allowing water into the lens compartment. But the grandkids like them better than any goggles they've had so far."
4.0,"It's a cute bracelet and very well made.. why I took a star off. The letter ""S"" doesn't look like an ""S"" at first I thought they sent me the wrong one, which wouldn't have been an issue I would have just returned it. Looked back on here and it was an ""S"". I didn't notice it under my daughter and husband brought it up. So, now I know. It's the letter."
4.0,Pretty dress and fit is perfect. However I ordered white and it is not white. This dress is definitely ivory not pure white.
4.0,These shoes were just so cute! A little tight but with the stockings they were a perfect fit. Matched perfectly with her dress. I have 4 stars Bc they were a little tight
4.0,Love the blouse.  It was a little snug around the chest...had to return.  I would go up a size if you are larger on top.
4.0,My ten year old likes them
4.0,"Be warned-these are Asian sizes, and way off for American body types. I sent first pair back because just looking at them I knew I'd never get them on. I generally wear an American medium or large. I reordered an XXL and they're a bit snug, but they look great. It is a Speedo-type swimsuit after all."
4.0,"What I like most about this shirt is how easy it is to care for. It doesn't wrinkle easily, even after sitting in my desk chair all day. It looks dressy enough to wear with nice slacks for a dressier look in an office, or with a pair of jeans for a night out. The wrist area does not adjust, and was a bit big for me, but overall a great dressy shirt that I will keep for special occasions."
4.0,Very beautiful. just a little heavy and not so easy to hold. All these ring thing is more like decorates. otherwise it's great. I like it a lot.
4.0,"These were received a day earlier than expected.  They are pretty dark, and that's what I was looking for.  The fit is perfect for me.  I do appreciate the follow up from SunGlassUp.  If I find myself in need of more sunglasses I will be reordering.  I will also be spreading the word.<br />Thanks,<br />Carl"
4.0,We have struggled with the number of devices and cords we take on trips. The grid-it is a perfect solution to our packing needs. we also use it at home to keep cords and charges together.
4.0,Fit great and as expected. Material is thick. CN be worn out or around the house. Casual.
4.0,"Because it has only one piece in the rear it had a tendency to fly off over my head. I was unhappy with this and put it aside for a while.<br />I decided to try again with a different pair of pants and, this time, it held nicely. So I have revised my opinion from two to four stars."
4.0,Perfect for the 4th of July parade dress up!
4.0,"The Eurotard knee pads not only have a great name, they're also very functional for the price. I bought them for a dance class, and I've recommended them to some of the other girls."
4.0,I really like these house shoes. They're styrofoam on the bottom so they're definitely for in the house. My only complaint is that the band is a little big so I have to wear socks with them. They do their job though.
4.0,It’s very flattering but somewhat see through.
4.0,"these are a very inexpensive alternative to swim shoes.  I bought these for use on vacation, nothing heavy duty but my original intention was to toss them when we were done with them on that trip... actually brought them home and used them again a few times and they seem to be holding up pretty well, which is surprising for the price!  used for walking on the beach and pool area - and for running in the wet grass under the sprinkler.<br /><br />not much &#34;give&#34; in the opening to squeeze these on - but I guess that's good so they wont fall off..."
4.0,wood bi more times
4.0,I bought these socks to wear to work (I wear scrubs and sneakers everyday).They are very comfortable but they were just slightly larger than I expected.
4.0,My daughter loves it and she says it is very warm against the winter winds.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"I love the length and the material of this, but the padding it comes with doesn’t do much. It is see thru but I made it work by switching out the padding with black padding I had and that made it not see thru! Other then that I love it"
4.0,they are really pretty but they don't adjust easily and they are tight on my chubby toes
4.0,Quality and material nice & stretchy. However Dizon runs a tad big and very long pants. Made for 5'8&#34; person.
4.0,"I wanted a bag insert for my LV Saleya MM and bought this in medium size (since the previous reviewers recommended sizing down). It fits great; however, I turn the organizer inside out to better fit the structure of my bag."
4.0,"Comfy but as soon as i washed it once, the creases in the neck are coming undone and its a bit cheap"
4.0,"Great value; reasonably good craftmanship, fabulous color combination fir versatility. Will buy in another color"
4.0,These ear muffs were fine for the price.  They kept my ears warm and fit my husband just fine.  They folded up as stated and were compact enough to put in a coat pocket.
4.0,Runs small order 1 size up.
4.0,"It looked small for the size I ordered but it stretches nicely, the upper part it’s not the most flattering piece of clothing if you have a belly. But the fabrics feels nice and soft (like satin)."
4.0,"I love the shirt, the matierial, the picture, but for a large it's very small.  I should have gotten a larger size!"
4.0,These fit as expected with the exception of the toe spot. Just barely fit around the toe but looks like with wear they will losen just enough to make it comfortable. I'm a size 7 and bought the size 7. They do have some cushion and mild arch support but some simple thin insole does the trick to make them even more comfortable
4.0,Its good in quality
4.0,This is a gift so I hope the person loves it.
4.0,"My girlfriend loved the idea of the sunglasses strap but the second time she wore it one of the links came apart and she had to fix it. Looks good, quality could be a little better for the price."
4.0,"love the shirt! the lace is not sewed on at the edges which caught me off guard at first, but it fit perfectly and was really cute"
4.0,"This necklace is great. I bought it because I often wake up with headaches in the morning and read that it worked for others. I thought I'd give it a try and it does seem to work. Be patient though, it might not work overnight. The headaches are gone but I still have neck and shoulder pain. I haven't been using it very long so I will update if things improve even more over time."
4.0,"This feels a little cheap to the touch, but does the job for dance class."
4.0,Beautiful dress looks exactly as pictured! Fit great in all the right places and love that it comes below my knees.
4.0,"it feels nice and cozy to wear them when i clean my driveway after a snow storm.  i will recommended them , good price , good seller and deliver..."
4.0,Wasn’t as heavy as I anticipated very thin.  But I like.
4.0,"It's very cute, but short. Which wasn't an issue for me. You cannot wear a bra with it as the backs cut out. I ordered a Medium. I'm 5'7 and 145 lbs."
4.0,"The color was more of a Forrest green, where as the photo indicates a teal color!"
4.0,"When I first opened the package I thought there was no way I'm getting in these. They slid right on but are a bit snug. They do have a lot of stretch in them but I would have gone up a size if I knew they ran small. Ordered my normal size which is a medium. They're cute though and very soft.<br /><br />Reference 5'7 154lbs 30""waist 37"" hips"
4.0,this band is good
4.0,looked good but the clasp was faulty on it w<br />fell off my husbands wrist and he did not notice. He lost it very sad about it.
4.0,"It’s a cute dress, doesn’t fit as well as the pics, but I like it."
4.0,could be unisex
4.0,I did not like that the color looks different.I was buying it more for the color than anything else.The wool quality is not bad.
4.0,"Have received many compliments with this on by belt.  I always say, &#34;well, it should be neat considering what it cost.....&#34;.  It holds the Galaxy S3 with a rubberized case on it just fine.  The metal belt clip is sturdy, and it rotates.  Good product, but just wish it was less expensive.  I think I could have gone to a custom leather works shop and had it made cheaper than what I paid for it on this site."
4.0,"Fits well, I like the material"
4.0,"First of all, this ring is not a wedding band. It is a cocktail ring. I bought it to use as a festive, holiday ring and it suits my purposes. It's a cute design and it grows on me the more I wear it. Before purchasing, you should know that this ring is somewhat chunky. May not suit folks with short fingers. I disagree with the other reviews that say the stones are smaller than pictured. Yes, they are small, but you can see that in the picture on the model's hand. And, of course, the other pics are very zoomed in. Is it real gold plated? Hard to tell, but I haven't had any allergic reactions or marking on my finger, and I've been wearing it constantly for the past few days. If you are looking for something classy and super-high quality, this 15 dollar ring is not for you. But if you need something cute, cheap, and fun, then it works well. I gave the ring four stars because it's a good ring, but it doesn't ""wow"" you the way a five star product should. Just good, not great."
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend. It is really adorable in person and comes in a cute box. Took around 2 weeks to get here. Seems very well made.
4.0,This was a pretty good shirt. Great color and print and cute with jeans. Def would buy again. Only reason I put four starts was the neck would move a bit low but nothing I can’t fix.
4.0,Fabric a little thin but these appear cute and comfy
4.0,"The watch face is not as sparkly as the photo suggests, but it looks fine. No way on earth I could ever read the date, but can’t on most watches."
4.0,It's a nice piece.
4.0,This shirt is really cool! I can't wait to wear it. I normally wear a medium to large and I bought an XL in this shirt and it is pretty fitted but I like it.
4.0,"Much heavier than I anticipated (so not really a summer dress), and I need a modesty panel for it or my bra shows, but very cute and comfortable, if not about 2&#34; too long for me (I'm 5'3&#34;). I'll see about getting it hemmed. Very flattering otherwise."
4.0,I really liked it. its beautiful!
4.0,This dress fits great! It is ideal for professional or a night out. I purchased 2 more!
4.0,El único inconveniente ha sido la correa (belt) del brazalete. Es de mala calidad. Creo que pudieran mejorar esa parte.
4.0,"Fits real great, soft and stretchy, but not baggy. Makes me feel and look flattering."
4.0,"Probably could give this shoe a 5 star because it may have been my size option rather than the shoe, but it was too loose, I prefer a snug fit, but the shoe itself overall is nice and comfy material. it matches my jammies wonderfully. I originally had a expensive pair of Acorn slippers, but the logo in the heel of the slipper was annoying, i could feel it, and it was not pleasant. They should find a better place to brand our shoes."
4.0,"Just a little short for me, as I have long legs...but nice anyway! Good fit where it counts, if you know what I mean! They stay up!"
4.0,"The color is wonderful. It is very pretty, lightweight and perfect putting a cami under. It looks great on the model, not on me! I am very disappointed. It fits well but the draping in front does not sit properly. It looks bizarre and not like the picture. I wonder if it not sitting properly over my breasts. The model in the photo is a little flatter and the sweater lays nicely on her. I don't know, but it is not for me."
4.0,Adorable and comfortable!!
4.0,"Cute band looks just like the picture. Holding up really, been wearing it everyday. I have the 40mm SE apple watch."
4.0,Love it! Fits great. So comfortable
4.0,My one issue is the flimsy dispenser box. Somewhat resolved with packing tape so the box doesn’t fall apart.
4.0,I had problem with a gap around the arms
4.0,"These boxer briefs are very comfortable. The waistband is non-restrictive and the cotton is very soft. The legs don't ride up or chafe. If you require support from this type of underwear, it may be lacking. I didn't find these underwear to be as supportive as other brands. Other than that, I found the fit to be true to size.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"Love it but too small orderd a L returning for an XL I'm 5'6 177 size 10, 38D"
4.0,"Love this belt, quality is good, very cheap...love ittttttttttt"
4.0,"Love this sweater, lightweight and comfortable. Only 4 starts because it is a bit shorter than expected and i ordered a size larger then i normally wear."
4.0,"Material is very thin, but also fits nice.<br />Runs small so order 1-2sizes up as it does not stretch."
4.0,"Great boots, they fit in the calf which is a big deal for me at 18&#34; round... but a lot of room in the foot and ankle. All in all would buy again, cant find boot this wide in the calf without giving a little somewhere."
4.0,"Delivery was very fast.  The ring was too big (My fault when first ordered), but a very quick re-order and no hassle return fixed the issue fast."
4.0,Beautiful but little small for what I expected
4.0,"Lots of room in this backpack with several pockets.  Only issue I have is when you tighten or loosen the strings, it will get twisted and it's annoying."
4.0,Size up! I’m usually a Medium. I’m 5’4 and 170lbs. After reading reviews I ordered an xl and it fits perfectly. These tanks are super cute and soft. Just make sure to size up!
4.0,These are really great because they're not bulky and offer ankle support. They also have more of a tennis shoe type grip which is nice. My only complaint is that on the inside under the tongue the faux fur isn't smooth and they bother my daughter. We ordered two different sizes and they were both like this. It makes it feel bumpy/uneven. She has sensory issues so it's unfortunately really hard to get her to wear them now. I think if your kid isn't picky about the way shoes feel then these are great shoes and comfortable aside from that. They keep her feet dry and are very maneuverable. Great for wearing to school in places that actually have winter.
4.0,"I wanted the rose color as this is good contrast and easy on my eyes.  Ok for cloudy, but I was wanting a darker tint.<br />Product seems sturdy and will wear well."
4.0,"Ordered this to give me another option for carrying my wallet. It seems decently constructed with smooth, soft material so I feel it will be fairly comfortable wear next to my skin. Pockets are good for carrying a wallet, cash passport or other such flat items. My only complaint, the plastic buckle used on the adjustable shoulder strap is kind of bulky & when adjusted for my comfort, it sits on top of my shoulder. This makes it uncomfortable if I were to put a backpack or other shoulder strap on that shoulder."
4.0,"I bought 3 pair, for Christmas.  the quality seems to be great & they may run a bit larger but that's what feet Jamie's are for!"
4.0,"These bands were very thin in material than I expected, however, they seem to do the job just fine. Although, after more than an hour and a half of wearing, I do feel a little pressure around my head. I have a 7-3/8&#34; hat size. Over time, the bands may stretch out a bit. I've already washed my band once, and after a washer/dryer session, the band still seem as good as the first day. Time will tell how they last, but for this price, it won't break the bank to replace a couple times a year (depending on usage)."
4.0,"Good for the sauna! not heavy, very light"
4.0,"Cool pair and cool soft pouch, but like any aviators ive had they scratch and smear easily, i feel like im constantly wiping them down.  But great price for a decent pair of sun glasses"
4.0,"They are nice and thick, but the waist was smaller than I expected given everything else fits fine. It is really high waisted and sufficiently long for my long legs."
4.0,Great dress by itself or paired with a denim jacket. Runs small so I suggest sizing up.
4.0,"The quality of this dress is great. Very comfy and flowy. I'm am 5'5"" with 36D cup size, 130 pounds. I ordered a small, it fit okay through the bust. It wasn't too tight. It was a tad short for my taste. I would prefer longer, so a medium would have been better for me, but this had nothing to do with quality of the dress."
4.0,"I have a large head, 7 5/7 to 7 3/4.  This hat fits me well.  It is nice to find a hat that fits that isn't really expensive."
4.0,"The dress fits nicely, I like the pocket size and the fabric feels lovely."
4.0,Brought for my granddaughter because she looses her nose rings so much but she changes it every week.
4.0,Perfect for spring/summer dress. Everyone at my office gave me complements.
4.0,Wish they came in petite but otherwise they fit was accurate per size chart.
4.0,"I'm too cheap to go all out for some Blue/Gold Ray-Ban's, and these are worth the money. A bit big on my face, but I have the head of a child and should have read more about the men's frame. I love them, they are comfortable and trendy. Aviators are my favorite, and these colors are spot on for a great Ray-Ban look-alike. Very pleased, and the shipping was super fast."
4.0,This is the second one I purchased. First one lasted me about a year. I would recommend
4.0,Nice little present for my grand daughter. And she loved it.
4.0,"Get eye protection designed especially for avid swimmers! The flexible frame seals tight and leak proof.  Keeps water out of sensitive eyes and are so comfortable that kids and adults will keep them on for all their pool fun all day. It's great for swimming on or just below the water surface, and for any water activities where UV and vision protection are important. Designed to fit all face sizes for adults but with the flexible frame, will fit children between ages 4 - 12, Friendly adjustment buckles allow even small children to easily adjust the strap by themselves; and the straps stay adjusted for a comfortable fit Unique wrap-around shape provides a 180-degree field of vision - far more than the 70-degree vision available with traditional goggles. The mirrored finish provides 100% protection from UVA and UVB rays, and cuts the glare that comes off the water for out door use.<br />Kid-friendly buckle system<br />180 degree field of vision<br />Virtually leak-proof<br />Designed for the avid swimmer, used by all.<br />Comes with a caring case, ear plugs, nose clip and glass cleaner cloth. How can you go wrong! Affordable enough to pick one up for each member of the family."
4.0,"I am kind of petite and I was afraid that this skirt would be too big since it's a one size only, but It actually fit great. I am 5'2 and the length is just perfect for me. I wouldn't recommend it for a tall girl. The quality was great for the price, I like it."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:70eb25193f6b5e36fd39ec0c78ffca45]] If you're a D.va fan and want a new mask, or just want a new mask this is awesome. I know gaiters have a bad rap, but the design of this means you fold it over TWICE, so it then passes the 'candle test.' I get some weird/angry looks from people who are far away who think I'm not wearing a mask, lol. Can feel hot if wearing for a while."
4.0,Great but not as fluffy as expected or as they appear!
4.0,As in love as I am with this robe I'm also very dismayed. It sheds a lot. I have seen more balls of this robe on my clothing.Then I have only worn it a few times and the satin lining is already unraveling on one side so far. If your a seamstress sew the satin lining before wearing it may help
4.0,[[VIDEOID:4dd2141685d451ba3f2a9ccefaa5f6dc]] Very fun mask! I enjoyed playing with it and had a lot of stare riding my bike at night on the pier. The sound activation works perfectly and you can adjust the sensitivity with the knob from minimum to max. The fabric is soft and thick so probably will get hot wearing it during the summer time. Best probably more for winter or cooler weathers.<br />Only downside I experience everytime i wore it it keeps sliding down from the back. Either it needs holes to wrap your ear thru it or need few strip of those silicon gel on the inner fabric to have a better grip on the back and side hair. So if you plan to wear and not do too much jumping around or moving around it might work but I could not bop my head while wearing this because it's just too fun.<br />Also maybe a longer Velcro strip so more size head can fit. My boy couldn't wear it because Velcro wasn't long enough to wrap around his head securely.<br />Overall it's very fun and works great.
4.0,"Bought this for my husband and he loves it!  Only downfall is he says the handle rattles in the car, and since he is sound sensitive, he now keeps it in the trunk."
4.0,"This is a truly beautiful dress. There is no need to pay for expensive dresses. The dresses from this company are just as beautiful as high end brands. They are made of great quality. They do run small, but high end brands do some of the times also. I bought this dress for my daughter. She fell in love with it! I will definitely buy from this company again. the picture doesn't show the beauty and sparkle of the dress. The silver sequins shimmer in the light. If you have daughters going to pageants,proms, military balls or formal events this is a beautiful dress."
4.0,"Mainly purchased for the pants. They’re super soft and stretchy. Absolutely adorable. The top is cute, too. Material is not GREAT, but good for the price! Super cute on my little girl."
4.0,Easy to wash.  Only problem is they keep shedding the little black beads!  But I have reordered them at least twice.
4.0,"This Fashion Sunglasses look great!<br />They fit nicely a bit large for my face but they look GREAT i like them, plastic construction makes it prone to braking so take care of them!<br />They provide a nice case for them use it!!"
4.0,The earrings are nice. The hoops however fall out very easily. They would only be good for a calm outing only. They are not a everyday wear or work wear quality. The studs are perfect
4.0,I love this 😷 mask! It's beautiful and comfortable not to mention that it's depicts my favorite DC character and the person everyone says I am!
4.0,very good compression
4.0,"They are really cute,and comfortable, however they fit a little wide. The strap on upper part is loose. Usually a 5 1/2 fits but a 5 would have been better"
4.0,I wanted this top to fit so bad because I purchased the XL bottoms and they fit great.  I ordered the top in a size using the size chart that was recommended.  I wear a 38D in a bra so I ordered accordingly but this top was WAY too small all around.  I would say it was more of a 34-36Ccup.  I was happy I was able to return it but there were no more to reorder.
4.0,Cute. A little short though.
4.0,Very roomy!!!
4.0,"First experience with this brand, shirt fit as expected.  Fabric seems ok.  Will try other of this Brand"
4.0,Quite short<br />Thin material but not see through<br />No tag so you can’t tell if you’re wearing it backwards or not<br />Other than that it is extremely cute
4.0,"These are very nice earrings , however they are way smaller than the pictures showing them.  I wear longer earrings and thought from picture they were at least 2"" but more like 3/4 "".  I didn't understand the write up and just went by photos.  I wish measurements would be given on all from the wire hook hanging down.  Thank You."
4.0,Fits very comfortable. Very soft material. Like it. Recommend it
4.0,"I like these! Great combination of cotton softness and stretchy performance.<br /><br />Glad I gave these a try.<br /><br />I ordered M because I was going through a fat phase. They work, but I'd probably get S next time. (I'm 5'9&#34;, currently 146 lbs.)"
4.0,This seems well made and durable. I plan on using it during camping trips. I have tried it out @ home a few times and it seems to work well. I wish all the pockets were mesh or transparent tho.
4.0,I gave it to my husband for Valentine’s Day and he loves it
4.0,Fits great as the recommended sizes. Material is great. The color is darker than I thought I was ordering.
4.0,"My bad, had I looked at ALL images I'd have found size chart and ordered much smaller than my actual shoe size.. but I didn't. Sadly my foot swims in these, the bottom of slipper is stamped ""M 265mm"" which is 10.43 inches and that is much larger than womens size 6.5 - 7.5  :( I gave it 4 stars because they're SO cute and I love a reeeally wide toe box. I'm pretty certain I'll try again, their smallest size, fingers crossed."
4.0,Very nice for the price.  Clasp us especially nice.  Pearls somewhat flatter in shape than I would have liked.
4.0,I like these. These are not a statement piece but are true to photos and can be worn at any mid arm height since completely self adjustable. Other then them looking so new and freshly made for my costume purposes they are exacatly what was expected.
4.0,Love the style. The pearl is a bit larger than I expected.
4.0,I love the look and comfort but it’s doesn’t hold its size and stretches out and can feel too big.
4.0,i got a medium i am 5’8” and 135 pounds i got a medium because i have a long torso. the boob part does not fit my b cups. i don’t think the small would have fit my torso however. i had to return it. sad but good quality super cute
4.0,Bottoms too small.
4.0,Fast delivery. Son loves it.
4.0,Too long. I just had to get it shortened.
4.0,"It's cute and lightweight and thin. So thin you can see through light colors. I bought the ivory and most any color tank top I wear under it doesn't look right from the back since you can see everything. Also the arm holes are slightly too small imo. I like the clingy, but another 1&#34; in the arm holes would have been ideal. I also don't care for how high it sits on your neck. It's not a normal neckline; it's drapes around your neck like a towel and that extra 1&#34; or so of material could have been better used for the armholes. In fact that seems to be why the arms are tight. They didn't add fabric for the neck cut, so it is being pulled from the back of the neck which makes across the shoulders tight due to lack of an 1&#34; or so of material- that then pulls on the arm holes. It's not terrible, it's just not right for me. (A bigger person -it's probably fine on 1x down or someone without broad shoulders)"
4.0,"Very nice. I have several shirts in this material. 4 or 5 different makers. Some from Wal-Mart, Amazon. I like them. Comfortable, easy to take care of."
4.0,not very well sewn
4.0,"Too small for me, but nice."
4.0,I like it but I think I expected to be more rose-gold like the watch it was designed for but it's noticeably much pinker than the watch.
4.0,"I love these!!! I get so many compliments on them. They do not hurt my feet. The only down aside is that the straps on the right shoe are not as loose so it takes a little struggle to get on. Overall, I’m happy with this purchase."
4.0,"It’s fit as I expected on my son. It’s a tad thin, but he loves Pj Masks so he’s a fan!"
4.0,"The color of the dress does not look like the photo at all. In the photo it looks almost like a beige but in person it is actually a very yellow peachy color that almost looks like a nude style dress color. The actual fit though of the dress is really nice. The fabric has a little stretch to it and is nice and lightweight, comes to a nice length."
4.0,Matched picture.  Perfect
4.0,"Just I was expecting. Good for the summer, little bit short but it's ok. I wish I looked like the girl in the picture so it looked on me perfect :)"
4.0,Love the feel and look!!
4.0,"I got these in about a month after I ordered them. When I received it, it was in a package inside 2 mini plastic bags surrounded with bubble wrap. I'm in love with these rings! Its so many varieties. I had a couple of repeats but overall there were so many great colors to choose from. I love wearing different ones like every month so this was perfect for me !"
4.0,"Nice looking and excellent for my bifocal lenses, but for me it was tricky to get them snug enough without hurting my head. I got a glasses straps, but the straps fit so snuggly that it was hard to get them off, and I ended up braking the frame. I got the same frame, and it has held up very well for over a year now. MyEyeDoctor was charging about 3 times the amazon price for these frames. Of course they are less likely than I am to break the frames when putting in the lenses."
4.0,"Great suit for the money, very flattering"
4.0,"Nice bag, quality for the price."
4.0,* windows would have been just right.
4.0,For some reason it was big on me. I will order large instead its a pretty dress i would buy all colors. I'm 45 in hips and 38d in chest xlarge was large on me.
4.0,"Cute outfit, it's true to size."
4.0,"Great value for a good quality rose gold, adjustable bracelet. The straps are adjustable which means my 4 year old can wear it too (which she loves, ""I look like mommy"" she says) and the design is cute. For the price, the quality offered is superior. It doesn't seem to cause any irritation on my skin or my little one's skin.  I highly recommend it."
4.0,I love the product but it kinda took a bit long than I thought it would to get there. The clasp is strong.
4.0,Love the color!!! The earrings are small. More suited for a child then adult.
4.0,"Very sweet key chain, would have been nicer if it were engraved."
4.0,Very nice but does not have the black background as shown in the listing photo pic. Its all silver
4.0,"Nice jacket ,they just run really small so order accordingly. Other then that I love it."
4.0,I use as an undershirt
4.0,"This dress was kind of a gamble bc there weren't many reviews. I bought a size small (my usual size) but I should have bought a medium instead. It's a little shorter than I'd like it to be and the arms are a little bit tight. It feels pretty cheaply made, and it looks pretty ridiculous without the belt. Once you add the belt it looks super cute and flattering! I'm excited to wear it and hopefully it doesn't fall apart after only a few uses."
4.0,This is a well made and beautiful hat. The item was as described and shipping was very quick. I plan on ordering the black one. The reason for my giving it 4 stars is because I've worn the hat for only a week and one of the buttons on the back of the hat has already popped off.
4.0,"Based on some of the reviews I thought that the product will fit small, so I ordered a Medium instead of Small. But better too big than too small.  But it’s cute and comfortable and love the material. The shipping didn’t take that long either, only a few weeks."
4.0,"My husband ordered this vest because he wanted something that would cover more than just his waist. It fit perfectly to his t-shirt size which was a medium. For sweating it did help him sweat but not as much as other waist bands he has used. However, he wanted something more than just his waist which was why he looked for this vest. After about two weeks he did start to get a small reaction between his shoulder blades. Nothing big but you can see slight redness and small tiny bumps. I always say never to take much into consideration on reviews where people say “DO NOT USE!” BECAUSE everyone’s skin is different. Not everyone will get that reaction. I would say YES this is a good purchase for an all over vest!"
4.0,"Cute tulle skirt with about 6 layers of material. Love the satin-like waistband and under slip (no itching!!)! Fits me great...Nice item to dress up or down, depending on the top and accessories. Great quality and the stitching is nice as well.<br />I ordered this skirt in a champagne color - and it is beautiful!<br />I do wish there were pockets, though - maybe on a new skirt.<br /><br />Overall: I love this skirt! I'd recommend it to anyone looking to add a little spunk to their closet.<br /><br />Please note:  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion and review. All thoughts and statements listed are my own. The offering of this product at said discounted rate had no bearing on the review listed.<br />This review will be edited to include pictures"
4.0,Currently wearing them - comfortable.
4.0,I received alot of compliment on this skirt but tje zipper was cheap..
4.0,"Definitely should have read reviews about this running large before ordering. Aside from that, I love this shirt! The material is so soft, I think I will just use it as a wear around the house comfy shirt rather than exchanging for a size down. I got the blue, and it is such a vibrant blue that I love! The loose fit is growing on me, and maybe after washing and drying it will be the perfect fit. I love the cut outs on the arms, the placement and size is much better than some cutouts on other shirts I have bought! I am happy with the purchase, and would recommend to others with the warning that it does run a full size bigger than you typically wear. Will post photos of how it fits AFTER washing and drying!"
4.0,Runs small. Recommend getting a size bigger
4.0,Very nice product. Soft and easy to wear
4.0,The dress neck was very high so I wore the back jn the front and took off the tag and it worked out perefctly! I got so many compliments on this dress. It was well made and the price was great. Looked like  $200 dress!
4.0,"The pros of these boots are:<br />1. Price<br />2. Seem well made. I will come back in 6 months to confirm if they hold up.<br />3. Comfortable, except for the fact that they are a tad too high. Half an inch lower would be perfect. The good thing is that the material is soft, so it will not chaff against the shins.<br /><br />There is only one ""cons"", and it's the fact that they do not have a zipper. This, added to the fact that they are a bit tall, makes them difficult to put on. But once on, they are extremely comfortable.<br /><br />The pair I received has gold (not silver, as pictured) metal studs. Overall, satisfied with my purchase. Also, I do not believe the sole is ""wood"" as stated on the description, it is most probably all rubber. They definitively are not for ""formal"" wear; I plan to use them for horseback riding."
4.0,"Ohvera’s One Shoulder Party Prom Gown Maxi Long Dress is a gorgeous, elegant, and sexy shoulder dress.<br /><br />The dress is made mostly from polyester, but the texture is rather silky but thick. The dress looks gorgeous and the bright red color vividly shines under amber lights. This dress is perfect for special occasions such as a prom or even for weddings! You should hang it on a hanger to prevent wrinkles and wear a strapless bra under the dress.<br /><br />The medium size fits me the top part, but unfortunately, it was too long (about exceed 10 inches) to my 5.3 ft height even when I put on high heel shoes. There is a zipper on the side of this dress so you can wear this dress on/off easily by yourself. The accessory ribbon makes your waist look slimmer and gives a good accent, but there are no belt loops. The slit is more close to the center than the description picture is shown."
4.0,This product is ver pretty but is really small for a bank. The good thing about it is that there is a snap to remove the money when ever you want. It is more like a change purse size.
4.0,"Incredible durability!  This hat went on my trip to Bermuda.  I felt a bit odd because it is an Aussie &#34;cowboy&#34; hat, not a beachy hat.  I also feel like one of those people who doesn't look good in hats.<br /><br />This hat protected my head from back-flinging branches and foliage in Thomas Moore's Jungle and the pouring rain.  It was such a stereotypical &#34;tropical rainforest&#34; day of hiking.  A tropical storm was passing away from Bermuda on the very day we hiked under the very thick foliage.  (Figured that if we couldn't enjoy the beach, we might as well enjoy the jungle as it was meant to be enjoyed:  with drenching rain showering bugs and thistles off of us.)  The hat showed not a scratch from the leaves, branches, etc. wacking into my hat as I pushed forward.<br /><br />The next day the Bermuda sun was back and blistering.  So, I went off to Horseshoe Bay to dip myself and even dipped this hat into the ocean!  Yep.  Not even when wet did this hat show discoloration, salt accumulation from the ocean dips, or any other signs of wear and tear.  It kept its shape throughout!!<br /><br />Whether I look good in hats or not, I had a new appreciation for me in this hat!  It's amazing.  I think I would have preferred a larger circumference brim and a round gambler shape.  I also would have liked a chin strap to hold it on my back, like a pair of glasses you remove from your face and dangle before you.  I saw other people with those crushable canvas hats with mesh tops and draw cords to hold it on their heads.  I liked that when they entered a store they could throw their hats back, but I had to carry mine.<br /><br />By the way, the elastic in this hat is also amazing.  Without incurring hat head or squeezing me uncomfortably, it somehow suction cups this hat to your head.  The hat rides quite high off your ears, so it is truly a bio-mechanical feat of engineering that I recommend to Amazing Feats of Science on cable.  It resisted every strong gust of win and crashing ocean waves.  :)"
4.0,"It is a lovely dress and fits well but be very prepared for how long it is,  am 5'7"" and I put on three inch heels and it was STILL to long. I am now try to figure out how and where to hem it."
4.0,Loved the shirt design.  Seller very good.  The shirt ran on the small side.
4.0,"I don't know what bracelet the guy (or hairy baby?) in the picture is wearing but I wish this bracelet wrapped around my wrist 5 times. It does wrap around 3 times perfectly though. It's pure leather and looks pretty durable, even where it fastens. US buyers beware, this item does come shipped from the UK so it will take 2 or more weeks to arrive."
4.0,"Thought it was a beautiful dress.5'6""  XXL,Little snug in the chest for DD's. After a good ironing and 10lbs it will fit perfect."
4.0,is super high quality and wonderful but if you are a big strong guy tryin 2 show off your mucles order it 1 size larger than normal i got amedium thats nice but i should hav got a large
4.0,I really like these underwear so far. I wash them in cold water and just let them hang dry. They are comfortable and fit well. I use them for my sports coach job and I haven't noticed a smell. I hope they last!
4.0,Cheaper material than what looks like in the picture. But still pretty cool. Glad I got it in black I figured that would camouflage the cheap material best I think I was right. Still great though !
4.0,Super cute and i love the fact you can squeeze to adjust fit but the letter “i” doesn’t look as pictured
4.0,Fit was as expected and material actually has quite a bit of give/stretch to it. I probably could have gotten a medium.  A petticoat would definitely be needed though if more fullness wanted in skirt to achieve true 50s look.
4.0,This dress was made very well for the price. It was very generously sized. I sent this dress back because it looked a little to mature for me. But I would recommend if this is the style you are looking for.
4.0,"I want to say that this jumpsuit is fire and well made, however, order 1 size (maybe 2) up.<br />I am a true medium in almost all clothes. I don’t like things to be skin tight on me so medium is usually a well fitting, comfortable size for me but not in this case.<br />I am 5’8”, 140 pounds, 34 c-d and I have a big bubble butt. Usually I have issues with jumpsuits not being long enough in the torso but this one was fine but I almost passed out getting this on.<br />It’s so so snug. It still “fits” but I can only imagine how much trouble it’ll be trying to take it off to use the restroom.<br />Also know that if you have long arms like me the sleeves will not go all the way down to your wrists but that’s kind of the standard with most long sleeve things.<br />I am going to try and exchange this for a Large but I may have to bear it and hope it’s okay for the event in attending."
4.0,So cute.  My daughter wore these with a football onesie to make her look more like a football.  Nice and thick.  The ruffle and the bottom was a little wonky but still cute.  Got for a 4 month old and fit great.
4.0,Very lightweight material not see through.
4.0,they run a little big
4.0,It's pretty and all but it doesn't go around my neck all the way I had to ad an extention
4.0,i like them but they don't fit my glasses as well as I hoped but can still wear them. I love that they come with a case and cleaning cloth.
4.0,"Very tight, as designed. Shows some side boob for sure. Looking for a sexy dress for adult only settings. Love the open low back. Comes right to the top of the butt. 5'2&#34; 34B, all ass. Fits as shown by the model... tight."
4.0,the middle panel is not very stretchy- was a surprise- but I am long-waisted and it was OK.  Flattering for a bulky middle LOL
4.0,Cute dress but it shrinks once you wash it.
4.0,"Pendant came with stick fragments and extra epoxy all over the surface of it. But I put in some elbow grease and got it all scraped off and polished up.<br />I’m happy this necklace came on a nice chain and in a very nice gift box, perfect for wrapping and gifting right away! The dandelion seed wishie is within the pendant as pictured, and the WISH charm is easy to read!<br />Thank you"
4.0,"Nice sweater. Nothing special, but a good basic black sweater."
4.0,"These earrings are cute!<br />They are large and lightweight.<br />My only issue with these earrings is that the earring back slides fairly easily and the posts would be better off with different earring backs that help the earring not fall off of my ear.<br />If you don’t play with your earrings then you would probably be fine with the provided earring backs.<br /><br />** Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review.<br />I hope the information that I've provided helps to make your decision a little easier.<br />If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below."
4.0,These are beautiful earrings but my hair gets stuck in them a lot so can't wear them for long periods of time or sleep with them.
4.0,"The giant cheap cringe tag is the downside, screaming something like genuine cashmere feel, that reminds me of the old 1980s tv commercials touting ""genuine imitation leather"". Scarf is soft, stylish, functional at a great price. There are a ton of merchants selling this exact same product, clearly all made in the same factory, with the same tag, so just find the cheapest one and order it."
4.0,"The quality is good and it's quite warm. The lining is thick and soft. Only issue is that it runs very small - I ordered a size larger so it would fit over clothes and it's obviously much smaller than the standard for that size. That means it won't fit my child for very long. Had I known, I would have bought two sizes up."
4.0,Very nice. Fast shipping
4.0,For the money like.
4.0,My son says that it is a good value for the money he spent.  He used his birthday money for this purchase.
4.0,I really like this shirt. I also have it in Green as well. The colors are really vibrant.
4.0,I like the gowns they were too small for a 1 1/2 month old ...they don't stretch enough..but I think it would have been good more for a new born baby...
4.0,Band is actually titanium based on weight displacement/ density but the clasp hinge is stainless and clearly stamped so.  It is light weight despite this and have kept it even though other bands are made of entirely titanium.
4.0,"Very high quality and a great fit for me most mask are a little small, wire in the nose bridge ensure a great fit. Better in slightly cool weather. I use it daily"
4.0,"Meh... It didn't have the same 'umph' as it did in the pic.. kinda a plain Jane shift.. I dk.. it's weird.. it looks JUST like the shirt in the pic but eeeghhhh again just doesn't have the same ""punch"" to it . I dk.. maybe it's me.. had a long rough day.. maybe when I get dressed up with it and out some extras on it I'll like it more.. I'll update y'all.. I want to wear it to church to knock some blocks off some folks head just dk if this shirt is gonna do it lol.<br />I also think that it fits PERFECT.. I guess I wanted it too look a bit More... frumpy.. lol."
4.0,"The tank tops are great, light and bright. They only get four stars because one of my colors was repeated. I kinda wanted a purple in my mix but oh well..."
4.0,"too short in the small in front honestly, v cute but could be better"
4.0,I am using it for my long skirt as a top. The black and white combo with patterned white stones was so adorable. Love it.
4.0,It is a little stiff. Middle pocket is really small.
4.0,After reading reviews I decided to go with a S/M despite wearing a size 12 in women's pants. This was definitely the right decision. It's loose without swallowing me whole. My only concern is that it's pretty thin and I think I'll have to wear a nude or white bodysuit underneath. It seems a little see through.
4.0,"a bit wide for a child with a small nose, but great over the glasses that block sun glare and light over the top of glasses."
4.0,"I bought the 5x black Checkered patter and the Blue vertical lined pattern. They both fit nicely if you are tall. I am about a size 32 and there was more than enough room for me in these, they are nice and breathable.<br /><br />The Blue had a fleece inside and a kind of corduroy outside. They are great if you want to wear leggings even as the weather begins to cool here in Texas. The tinniest of holes was on the cheeks, knocking a star on for that. It would have been nice if they had drawstrings. or belt loops, I know most leggings don't but the material is pretty prone to slipping and sliding like no-ones business."
4.0,Not high quality material but not terrible. I like it. I got an extra large and it's a little big but I ordered like that on purpose
4.0,My teen son loves these and can wear in school all day. They are good for me for short term. After awhile it gets hot and hard to breathe for me. I like the nose clip in them.
4.0,Very nice watch for a very reasonable price. Would recommend. Makes also for a nice gift.
4.0,Arrived on schedule nice and lit of stuff you can put on..<br />Satisfied customer here..
4.0,Lounge pants
4.0,Sound quality is clear and loud. Not bulky at all and Beanienis quality material. Only bad part was the velcro attached to the back of the speaker came off so it kept floating inside the beanie. But was an easy fix
4.0,"Very pretty.  I look for some length, color & possible weight.  I don't like too heavy necklaces.  This is good.  It would cost a lot more at large dept. stores. I tried it on but haven't worn yet.  Good purchase."
4.0,Great product just smaller than expected!
4.0,A little larger than expected and shirt is a little thin but its super cute and can still be worn in warm weather. And not only am I ok with it but my grandson loves it. Hes 2. And Im not a bot or some other bs reviewer so u can trust me. Lol
4.0,"Not bad! Fit is cute, but the buttons are inconsistent, causing gaps."
4.0,"Very well made, cute, comfortable, they run very large. I returned my sz M for a sz Small. I have not wore a sz small in a long time.I'm approx. 5'4, approx. 150 lbs"
4.0,"Overall, I love this dress. Cons- it does not breathe at ALL. Looks like a summer dress but fabrication does not breath. I've been wearing it w tights and boots and a denim jacket, perfect for the cold San Francisco summer. As other reviewers mention, it runs on the small side. I am an 8-10 and got an XL. I carry a lot of weight in my mid section and normally don't try shift dresses, but I'm glad I did with this one. It is still very flattering.<br />I plan to wear it a lot into the fall. If the fabrication was a more natural/breathable blend I would buy multiple patterns.<br />Shipping was fast and seemless. Overall I'm quite happy."
4.0,This times is just as expected. The color are vibrant and the band is super comfy. The only issue I had is the band was too big and there isn’t any kind of adjustable strap. I ended up taking around the threading on one end and just hand sewing it to fit. Fits like a glove now.
4.0,Very pretty. Looks exactly like the picture.
4.0,"Well built, bright color and sturdy frame. Came well packaged and with a carrying case draw string velvet pouch. I love them easy to see through comfortable fit. Would recommend to others"
4.0,"This anklet was nice;however, it could have had a little more weight to the chain.  The other issue that I had was the clasp. It was too small, it took at least seven minutes to connect the clasp.  I have arthritis in my fingers and hands.  I did like the adjustability of the anklet's additional chain.  I haven't taken it off since I received it and I've showered with on and it hasn't tarnished."
4.0,Great glasses just don't drop them in the ocean you'll never find them.
4.0,It will hold alot
4.0,Smaller than anticipated but the free gifts and etc are nice.
4.0,Beautiful dress and fit perfectly....way to long though.  Had to return it.
4.0,The actual bag color is more red than what you see in the pictures.
4.0,As advertised but they are a bit tight on my 18 month old's head.
4.0,Super cute tiny as heck I had to pay to install it
4.0,"Exactly as described, size up"
4.0,"Considering this is one size fits all, I found the elastic waistband to be a bit snug. The rest was fine. The material is quite nice and soft."
4.0,"These are good quality and look cute, but they are tight on me. I'm 5'2, 130 lbs and they are almost too tight."
4.0,My daughter loved hers.....
4.0,"I bought this to help slim down my tummy but the waist is loose, Its pretty.. I'll keep it but if you are looking for a slimming bathing suit this is not it."
4.0,This complimented my dress very well. Sadly the attachment to the pendant became undone whilst I was doing a presentation. Would I buy again? Yes. You get what you pay for. Delivery was very timely.
4.0,"Its not an original Moto 360 band as I thought, but it fits. I could've purchased the same band from any local watch repair store."
4.0,Very pretty but the color is a deep saturated gold. I returned it only Barca it did not work with my pastel peach gown.
4.0,"I ordered a large because I normally wore a 8-10, this dress was so tight I couldn’t get it to zip up, the material has no flexibility, but the dress is pretty...I returned it."
4.0,"Beautiful color, soft"
4.0,Not for extreme cold
4.0,"I like the look of this one. To me it's elegant and a little dainty. fits wells, seems durable. I did cut about an inch off the one side. I have a small wrist and didn't want the excess. The thread on the loops that keep the excess closer to the watch caused me problems, but I just turned them out. Other than that a great buy. I will most likely get another color."
4.0,I really like the look of this top. It fits well. It washed up well too. I hand dried it as I didn’t want it to shrink.
4.0,"I ordered these with hopes of wearing them to yoga. The shirts are not fitted at the bottom and are a little short, so they come up in poses. They're comfy, just not what I expected."
4.0,They are very pretty but such a unique color that my wife has had a hard time matching them with outfits. They are almost too unique.
4.0,These shoes are absolutely gorgeous! Thanks to the other feedback I knew to buy 8.5 instead of 8 because I prefer more toe room and prefer to wear with socks. They are much more comfy than they look although wearing them for 3 hours did start to hurt my feet. My only problem is that one shoe came with some scuff marks and residue on it even though it was well packaged. Must have happened at the factory.
4.0,"Excellent quality tank. Great stretch and softness. However, it runs very small. I ordered a 3XL and it fit like an XL....disappointing."
4.0,A bit narrow at the end of it. Love the colour though.
4.0,"This a re super cute but, they will change colors within days. So make sure you cover them with clear nail polish"
4.0,"Ordered a medium, usually a small and it fit well. It was ok but nothing too great. The tie makes it look awkward. Will be returning."
4.0,I really wasn't sure about this shirt but to my surprise it was very cute and fit was perfect!
4.0,"good material.. good stitching.. looks excellent for day to day usage.. looks strong enough to carry tablets.. big wallets, etc.."
4.0,The collar is kind of weird but other than that the shirt is cute and fits well.  I always wear medium tops and bought this in medium and it fits true to size.
4.0,Cute shirt runs on the bigger side but always hard to tell when ordering online.
4.0,"Su diseño y color la hace bonita, pero si vamos con el tema de protección solo cumple con la función de tapa boca pero es una tela delgada que no te protegerá de estornudos, no tiene para adaptar el filtro pero podrías hacerlo por tu cuenta reforzando una capa extra para introducir uno."
4.0,Super cute dress.  A tad tight in my chest (36ddd) but other than that exactly what I was expecting.
4.0,"I get compliments on this dress every time I wear it.  Very nice for summer wear to work or casual events. I'm 5'2"" and its knee length in me. Thick enough that you don't need to wear a slip.  Fits a little weird in bust/shoulders, but apparently no one notices but me."
4.0,"Only complaint is how yellow the necklace is. I love the look, it doesn’t fade (yet). Very lovely for the price."
4.0,"Love it! I was really hoping for something that my iPhone 6plus would fit into, but this isn't it. I think I was using the screen measurements, not the phones, when I ordered. Regardless, its a great wristlet/wallet. It has room for tons of cards, money, a phone (not a 6+), etc. Theres also a zipper change purse inside, and a clear pocket for ID on one side. Love Scout products, and this one didn't disappoint!"
4.0,Granddaughter loves the kitties
4.0,Love this dress.. Got a lot of compliments
4.0,I've had these pants for about 2 months. Almost all of the thread at the waistline is coming out. I'm not sure the the quality equals the price of these
4.0,I wore this outfit for first Sunday at church
4.0,"Delivered on time, very light weight, comfortable"
4.0,"The buckle is much easier to use than the old style military brass buckle with the sliding roller. This configuration snaps closed with teeth that bite into the fabric and hold it in place. The old style buckle depended on a wedge effect where the roller was pulled into closer proximity to the material to lock (wedge) it into a fixed position. Getting the old style loose again required breaking the wedged tension of the roller and was a pain!. This new configuration just pops open and releases the belt. Bada boom - bada bing! The fabric of the belt itself gets three stars, the buckle earned top rating so overall 4 stars. I am well pleased with this purchase and would readily recommend it to anyone interested in a robust item of clothing that will take hard wear and (apparently) last a long time."
4.0,"Yup, old lady glasses but they are pretty :) I love the little touches of bling on the sides. They fit over bigger frames, too. I don't wear the little glasses but prefer the more moderate size square-ish frames and these fit over them no problem. They don't hurt my ears or add weight to the nose or ears. Really like these."
4.0,"This is a really cute little set for any little ones that love to cook! My son is on the younger side of the recommended age so it is a little big, but more room to grow into it which is good! Seems like good quality, I expect it to last through some wear and tear!"
4.0,I love these. But the first pair I ordered broke the first day. But the second pair has lasted a bit
4.0,"nice sunglasses, at a very competitive price."
4.0,"I have had this since Xmas and wear it daily. It hasn't turned. Even tho i have exposed it a few times to water and soap. Fits perfect. I have a semi large wrist, and I don't need the extender. It is dainty. So  if you're looking for something thick, this is not it."
4.0,"I'm 5'1&quot;, 115 lbs, and 32DD. I ordered a size small and found that it fit (top and bottom). The bottom fit well, not too tight but not too loose. It is a cute, yet modest bikini. I ended up returning it because there is more blue than I expected and the colors are a lot cooler than what is shown in the picture. I thought the hues would be warmer. But it's great if you're someone who prefers white gold to yellow gold."
4.0,"loved the material, loved the fit, but I returned it because it was a little too risky for my event"
4.0,What I liked the most about this costume was the mask; it looks real and is a pretty good quality item.  Another nice feature is that you can adjust the glove to your size.
4.0,This is a very good wrist watch.<br />Looks higher than is of a price
4.0,"cute, but a little loose (and I don't have a small head at all)."
4.0,Neat design
4.0,I normally order a small but i read reviews and got 1 size up.  It fits great!.
4.0,The pants are flattering. They are however thin so you could see a little cellulite which I didn't like. They are very stretchy and comfortable. I ordered dark gray size large.
4.0,These fit a little snugger than I like and I think it is because the material is stiff.  Length is good as it fits down into my shirt.  Wouldn't buy again.
4.0,Ok shorts. Fit is a little big for me and they are a little wider than I expected. I wish I would have bought the size down. The material is nice and they are comfortable.
4.0,Soft material. Great feel. Always wrinkled.
4.0,I liked the style shape and design. I wish the ear straps would have been sewn on instead of glued.
4.0,Very comfortable and flattering. My only criticism is that the seams inside the collar aren't finished. Other than that a great buy
4.0,Very beautiful. I didn't like the suit being a one piece because it pulled the top down too far. I personally had to make adjustments. I cut out the bottom of mine and used a black pair of boy shorts bottoms from a different suit with it. I also had to take a ribbon and tie the shoulder pieces together behind my neck to keep the girls from coming out. Its a beautiful suit. I ordered a size larger which might be why I had to tie up the shoulder pieces but I don't understand why it was so short in the torso. Everyone is shaped differently.
4.0,These are great for little girls age10and up.
4.0,Leather is very nice.  I like the holster and the way my firearm fits but it's hard to get the firearm out quickly.
4.0,Looks good and quality is there...pretty comfy too...only downfall is that these are HEAVY so they do flop alot.
4.0,Eat me
4.0,The picture didn’t do it justice. It’s a very soft leather & very classy.
4.0,"I'm not knowledgeable enough to know in any detail how historically accurate this cap is, but according to my limited research it seems like a good-quality repro.  Not a perfect copy, but a good one at a good price."
4.0,Christmas presents for my grandsons 👍
4.0,"Just as cute in person as on line. The shoes fit in length, however, were too wide in the heel. Installed heel pads and that fixed the problem."
4.0,"I am 5’4 and 130ish pounds. 34B, 27” waist, 41” Hip. 4 in jeans. Wear a size small in just about everything. I ordered the small for the top and bottom. They both fit great, as I expected. The top is soft and stretchy; the bottom feels like a cotton pair of bottoms, they are thin and maybe the slightest bit see-through. Not noticeable until you stare at them way to long. ALSO. WASH the set before wearing as my bottoms came with a slight orange color stain. Doesn’t bother me as it came out on the first wash. I love the blue colors in this set. It’s super cute! Worth it and buy it!"
4.0,"Cute, decent length, a little stiff and tight around the waist"
4.0,Even though it says large is made for small frame women
4.0,I bought these for my kids to wear at the beach. I hope they work
4.0,"The chokers were very nice. However, the ribbon one is hard to manage and a little complicated to figure out. The others look beautiful, especially since they are so cheap. The choker feels pretty comfortable, and is a great addition to any outfit."
4.0,"Muy bonita, corre pequeña soy m y Cómpre una L para que me quede... L y tengo 130 libras"
4.0,Not fancy but greater a everyday watch!
4.0,Comfy dress - exactly what I needed for this in-between normal clothes & maternity clothes. The pockets are fun & the slits on the side add a little something extra. A great summer dress.
4.0,"Been using this watch for about 2 weeks now.  It is cheap and beautiful but a bit big for my wrist.  I do notice in low light if I look at the watch at an angle, the number in the background is hard to see due to the design of the glass.  No complain though."
4.0,My daughter love her gown even though it was way to big for the size
4.0,Smaller than expected but matched color
4.0,"Very nice, colors as pictured."
4.0,"Comfy but run large, and long"
4.0,"I ordered a size up based on the reviews and I'm glad I did. I usually wear a M/L and ordered the XL. Fit was perfect. I gave this 4 stars because the zipper is difficult. I used a few dabs of soap to remedy the problem. Extremely flattering. Doesn't look or feel cheaply made. Took quite a bit of steaming prior to wearing, but overall lovely dress!"
4.0,"i love them , i’d buy another pair . they fit comfortaly"
4.0,Great quality for price. Only down size is the size is on tag on the outside of shirt
4.0,These socks fit well and do not bind the leg. Thin enough for summer and good for winter also.
4.0,Very comfortable bra. I needed a design that provided more back and shoulder support. Due to recent neck injury I found the multiple hooks difficult. Fortunately I’m able to put it on without unhooking.
4.0,"Very nice for the price, wish it was a little bigger though."
4.0,Order a size up for US
4.0,"This mask is great.  It is padded just right to sit comfortably on the face.  There is even enough room to wear glasses underneath.  As I thought, the lack of a vent directly in front of the mouth causes some fogging when you are breathing heavily, nose breathing is perfect.  Even thought the color is black or &#34;Blcak&#34; the metallic finish is bright enough to give your position away at fairly long ranges.  The scarring and artificial wear on the mask makes it intimidating looking up close; not too much to take away from the design."
4.0,"I was looking for an affordable way to protect multiple pairs of reader glasses, so I can keep them in several locations (and don't have to remember to take a pair with me or carry them around). My glasses in the bedroom, bathroom, den, kitchen, and my work bag are covered, and the variety of colors makes them easy to find in each place (unlike my black leather wallet inside my black leather purse).<br />The felt material is dense but light, not too stiff, and a good thickness, providing protection from dust, tumbling up against other things, or being dropped, and the stitching is solid. I've had these for two months now, with no issues.<br />A few moments of rain, or being close enough to the sink to get some spray, surprisingly doesn't seem to affect the felt. I even spilled coffee on one, rinsed it out, let it dry, and it's fine. I was impressed.<br />Perhaps not as sexy, but they do the job as well as expensive leather cases I've had. Definitely recommend."
4.0,"This pajama set is very soft and comfortable.  These will be great to wear this summer when the house is warmer.  The material and sewing is very good and the lace makes this set look extra feminine.  I received an XL size for review and just to help you get a perspective on size I'm 5'9"" tall, 143 pounds.  The XL fit pretty well so if you are a big girl you might should size up though they do have quite a bit of stretch.  I washed them in the regular cycle and they came out of the dryer o.k. except the lace tends to curl up."
4.0,"Silky, fits well, feels nice"
4.0,"These glasses are perfect to add to a costume. They look and feel pretty good for low price fun glasses. I would not recommend buying if you plan on using frequently. These sunglasses are definitely meant as a costume addition, not everyday use. Also, the American flag design impairs your vision slightly. I used them while walking in a crowd at night and in a bar and I was still able to see fine so vision impairment is not extreme."
4.0,Love the strap. I wear it at work and running. It's more comfortable than the original and big and tough enough that it matches the watch. Only complaint is that the little leather retaining loops fall apart after hard use. They should throw in a few 10-cent rubber ones to make this a five-star product.
4.0,"I wanted to love this shirt. It is more of a dusty pink in person, still a pretty color. However, this shirt was not cut well for someone thats busty. I am narrow through the shoulders and a 34dd and it gapped a bit under my arm. I ordered a 6 and I could not even zip it up. I could have gone up a size but decided to just return because I felt like even a bigger size would have still left me with the fit issue through my bust.<br /><br />I also thought it was too short. I am 5'7 and the shirt showed an inch or two of skin in the back where it meets at the zipper above the top of my pants. Going to a professional event and later at the office, I didn't think that would be appropriate. So while I wanted to love it, it didn't quite work for me. If I didn't care about showing skin, or if you aren't as long in the torso as I am, the length wouldn't be a problem. It was really cute, just not on my shape."
4.0,My friend loves the rings however only 6 of 8 fit her but for the price it was still a great buy!
4.0,It carries everything I need and it's durable.  I like the bag.
4.0,"I ordered a size larger than usual.  That being said, it fits fine.  I'm not impressed with the cup inserts that were in it.  I'm a DD and they were small.  I just ended up taking them out and for the price it works.  Not a lot of support in the top though."
4.0,"Make sure to read measurement chart from the seller and not Amazon. I usually wear a medium, sometimes large. I ordered this in XL. I'm 5'3, 145 lbs and 36D. I love how high the waist goes. Almost all the way to the top. I love the fringe and bright color against my dark skin. I feel like this suit is mom appropriate as well as feminine. I feel sexy in this! I'm a little worried how the thin straps will hold up my boobs but we will see."
4.0,"There definitely throw back 80""s there worth the price."
4.0,Se lo regale a mi nieta y le fascino la pijama
4.0,"Good quality, but nearly impossible to get on my legs even at size large. Yes compression socks are supposed to be tight, but my chunky calves are just too much of a job for these wraps. I'm at 215 pounds. 😉"
4.0,"Ring is comfortable and a nice weight, with good quality gold plated setting. The CZ stones are inset in a bit too much and a bit too small, look more like little craters or pock marks than gemstones at most angles."
4.0,"The hats fits well and seems to be on target for sizing. However, the hat is far too expensive. This should have been priced in the $35 to $40 range and not $62 (with shipping charges). That said, the hat should last several seasons, and when assessed from that aspect, though it remains pricey, it is worth having."
4.0,"Great to have a spare since the photos usually ruin the insert before the wallet needs to be replaced. After many photo exchanges, the photos will all be viewed in clarity with the longevity of the wallet.."
4.0,"The playbill for Hamilton had to be replied on. Not an issue. My daughter loved it and the weight of it was much better than I thought it was going to be. Pleasantly surprised. Like I said, the piece was there and had come off during shipping.. dab a glue, good as new!"
4.0,"Love the style only wish they would be longer, they are shorter than the picture"
4.0,"Great dress, super happy that the size I picked actually fit me well. The material is nice and thick, doesn't look cheap either. Overall happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Good, but open pieces tore up my gloves, and I lost a gem."
4.0,The ball cap was exactly what I thought it would be when I ordered it.  The cap was also delivered ahead of the delivery schedule.
4.0,I really like the ring!
4.0,"The band was perfect, but the cups ran smaller than what my bra size is. Buy a cup size up."
4.0,"The wallet is slim for sure and I am amazed that you can insert your cell phone and a checkbook and it still remains slim-looking. The only problem is that I went from a much bigger wallet (depth-wise) to this slim one, so I have all of these extra store/club cards that I have nowhere to put. I guess I really need to eliminate junk from my life. I took away one star because after using all of the credit card slots, it's a little hard to get the cards out because that area of the wallet doesn't give. I still like the wallet though. Came in fancy schmancy packaging that is perfect for a gift."
4.0,Pretty nice shirt. The material is light and easy to wrinkle.  The fit is good.
4.0,"A tad smaller than I'd expected (relative to previous models I'd owned), and not meant for storing multiple lap times, but the chime is quite audible, the display is clear and considering the price, it's a great value. I also expect good reliability/durability based on previous experience with Casio."
4.0,"Basic navy blue, comfy maxi dress. A gift for my sister. She’s going to love it!"
4.0,Love the dress!!! Fits very well! Only thing I didn’t like was that the slip in the front was a little too high. Nothing a safety pin can fix 😊
4.0,I like this necklace a lot! Only thing is that the pendant feels like plastic and is kind of flimsy but all in all I really love this choker and can't wait to wear it :D oh and it came a lot quicker then expected so that is great!
4.0,Would have preferred a black cap and one that doesn't set up so high in the front but this cap is several dollars cheaper than the one I really wanted.
4.0,This shirt has earned me lots of compliments and inquiries about where I bought it. My one caution is that I ordered an XL after reading the comments about how small this runs. I usually wear a small. The XL was gigantic! Thankfully I can sew so I tailored it to fit me.  I’m 5’5” 123 pounds for reference.
4.0,"Great quality outfit and super cute! Material is durable and the colors are true! Very happy! I bought a 9-12 month thinking it would fit (maybe ) I perfect or a lil big, it is kinda small. My 11 month old is on the tiny side so I would need to have actually ordered a 12- 18 month ... she can still wear it just a lil more in the short side on the legs."
4.0,GREST PRICE!! Looks good
4.0,Not as much support in the bust line as was expected. I had to wear a bra underneath. Other than that the suit fit well.
4.0,"So overall this is a nice easy, breezy summer dress. I took a star off because the material isn't the best and you definitely have to size up especially if you are large chested, but it's easy to throw on, looks cute with sandals and a sun hat and is good for travel. It's not an investment piece but good for running errands. I also live in the south where it's super hot so this is a good dress for hitting up the breweries."
4.0,These aren't as opaque as I thought they would be. I ordered them the very second I got a run in my other black tights and they arrived very quickly. I ordered them to a PO box and they arrived a lot faster than a lot of things have.They are a little rougher than my last pair but they work really well last minute.
4.0,"Cheap, cute and comfortable! Worked great for my Princess Daisy cosplay! Even allows me to use my phone with them on!"
4.0,Overall pretty happy with this suit. The material is a little thin but other than that seems pretty good. The fit is what you would expect for the size. It looks just like the photo.
4.0,This is a rare green
4.0,"This jacket is absolutely perfect in style, fit and comfort however...I gave four stars due to the faux pockets. Why would someone purposely buy a jacket with fur and a hood to keep warm only to not have any real pockets to warm your hands?"
4.0,"I ordered this dress with no idea when or where to where it. I figured when the opportunity came, I’d wear it. Well….a few weeks later our family photo shoot was up. I still didn’t have an outfit in mind and or a color theme. When the mister said white, I was hoping the cream/off white color would be ok.<br /><br />The cream color and material looked great in person and the on print. It had a nice hug but not restricting feeling. It looked great with heels and I threw on some slippers for after and it looked just as great too!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!! Now I’m thinking what other color to purchase."
4.0,product filled the need and delivery was good
4.0,Looks good and is as described
4.0,This is a great costume. Fit well. Inflated we’ll. But it came with an ink stain on the white part. I reached out to the seller and they sent me a replacement but unfortunately is also had an ink stain on the white part. We didn’t have time to order a different costume so we went with the one that had the less noticeable markings. The seller credited some of the cost back to us which is why I gave 4 stars.
4.0,"I really love the looks and feel of this band. It dresses my Apple watch up for every day wear. The only thing I don't like is the magnetic closure, it won't stay firm in place, and the watch ends up like a bangle if you move your arm too much. However, the price point was excellent, as is the look so I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"Size was perfect the length was a little long, but this is one of those times you hope to wash and it shrinks a little."
4.0,"Very cute shirt...great with jeans and boots.. size fit well for me, I am 5'3&#34; D ( I love baggie!)  to casual for a nice necklace, but it worked.. long hair works better with this, I have short hair!  I do recommend. It is worth it for sure!!"
4.0,I ordered 3X for big guys even so the shirts are tight around the middle and hang down below my butt as if they were manufactured for a tall man.
4.0,Very Comfortable to wear all day long in an office. Can easily be dressed up and down.
4.0,"Love the dress, fits well and very comfortable. 5'9 tall & 140lbs ordered a small. I bought the red & white stripped dress only because everything in my closet is blue or black so I thought a pop of color would be great.  Wore it to school(HS teacher) and I have been called a candy cane, circus tent, Waldo and Santa's elf...lesson learned don't wear to school, kids are assholes! :) Will be purchasing again different color!"
4.0,got here in good time and wife liked it
4.0,Fits true to size. Fabric is A little thin.
4.0,I found this item searching for Bike shorts.  I was looking for some with padding and found these.  They fit nice and feel nice on.
4.0,It’s cute !
4.0,Bit bigger than I expected but nice pendant.  ;-)
4.0,"I bought this for my husband, and he thinks it fits fine.  It seems a bit large to me, but I haven't washed it yet.  Russell products are always a good value and wear well."
4.0,Cute anchors.
4.0,Got for my cousin who is 13 and about 6ft tall average build and large fit him fine
4.0,"Pros:<br />I received the watch earlier than expected<br />The watch was relatively easy to set up when looking at the instructions.<br />Feels sturdy, face is made out of glass, not plastic and band is made out of metal.<br />Led function is cool and easy to use.<br />Came in a cool pouch made out of premium feeling fabric and another slightly opaque zip lock bag.<br /><br />Cons: Band was too long and the watch didn't include any tools to shorten. I will have to take it to a shop to shorten the band."
4.0,This is a perfect over pant for my grand kids.  It runs a bit large so plan on a belt.
4.0,Amazing product great style and very light but they turn green after a two month period  of use.
4.0,Wanted to use for hood piercing. The balls were a bit too small and gauge could've possibly been a bit bigger. Not sellers fault. Product is accurate. Not sure on quality as I haven't used them.
4.0,The fit is not flattering on
4.0,I'm 5ft and 140 lbs so I got a medium. The top fits great. Since I'm bigger in the butt area my bottoms are kinda small tho.
4.0,This is a cute bathing suit. Looks just as described. Two piece navy blue. I like that it has a strap around the neck for extra support. The fabric is quality and should hold up through washing & swimming. Sized correctly.
4.0,I really like this shirt dress it's sexy I ordered xl I'm 5'5 40dd 35w 45h it reaches at the back of my feet which I prefer fits nicely around my breast area.It rides up a bit in hip area the collar is a bit large for my taste but I'll tack it down..Satisfied I recommend this item.
4.0,This hand blown glass ornament makes a great gift for the rooster lover in your life.  I own one and have bought one for a friend.
4.0,Nice quality hat for what I needed. I needed an extra large hat to install an portable video cam and this worked great.
4.0,This shoe is so cute! The only problem is it’s extremely narrow. My 2 year old is 6inch foot and I had to get him a size 10 and it barley fit. Size up! Other than that it was super cute!
4.0,kinda cheaply made
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and only 110lbs so I was having a really hard time finding scrubs that fit. The pants are a little bit short, but overall very happy with my purchase! Reasonable price too!"
4.0,"It is OS but for me i'm about 5'2 120 lbs it feels a little too big. OH and the side slit, would have been nice if it was sewn close. But, that's easy for me to change. Overall the quality is great can't bit the price. I just needed to tweak it a little."
4.0,Great pair of shorts! High waisted. Not too short. They run a tad bit small.
4.0,"These were a little large and they’re VERY inflexible. I guess it’s good that they probably won’t break, but it was really difficult to bend them to make them smaller"
4.0,Okay length in arms but much shorter in overall length than I expected for a swim coverup. My little one is almost 4 and it just barely covers his bottom. He is currently in size 3 bottoms and size 4 tops.
4.0,For the price it works. Passes these out to family and friends and they have lasted.
4.0,"It is well made and good quality, but a lot smaller than expected."
4.0,"This is a comfortable sweater. Suitable for late summer, early autumn or cool spring weather wear, very light and soft, wear on the body completely free of bondage. According to their usual size choice, is loose feeling, I like it very much. The fabric had a little pilling, so I took one star off."
4.0,"As someone who is more on the tall side, I wish there were a tad longer (and maybe a bit thicker), but beggars can't be choosers I suppose!"
4.0,Came just as shown in the picture and description. It also fit nicely.
4.0,Great look but cheaply made.
4.0,I didn’t expect the texture of the purse to feel so rough but it is the cutest gift for my daughter and includes a adorable puff ball
4.0,"Running shoes typically have a  very, very cheap insole. I remove them (use them in my dress shoes) and replace them with sorbothane (have done this forever).  I fine a pair of these insoles last for two sets of running shoes (900 miles). After that, they can be used in a walking shoe or tossed.  I have found many of my shoes, which I no longer wore, was simply because the insole was worn out. If you don't feel good in a shoe, you don't wear it."
4.0,"I was not exactly what I wanted. After I got it , I had it altered just a bit. The fabric is comfortable and very elegant. This was my birthday dress"
4.0,bought the maroon color bag as gift for a friend in her 40's & she loves it!!!
4.0,Nice belts for the price. They appear to be a good quality and I like that you can cut them to fit if they are too long. I gave four stars because I wish they were a little wider.
4.0,Cute. Looked adorable in my 7month olds pictures
4.0,I really liked this dress.  I usually wear Medium I am 156 and 5ft7.<br />I was going to order additional colors then they raised the price. It was a steal at $13
4.0,I loved the sarape but I thought it was the entire outfit and it wasn’t. other than that love the sarape
4.0,These last long enough to be fun for school age kids.  They can put them on their fingers and dance or play.
4.0,"I bought this for a black less dress, I am a 34dd. I actually bought several different brands, none of which were big enough, but this one did hold up the entire night. Just wish the cup was bigger"
4.0,"One of my favorites. Color was a bit darker than navy, but good fabric. Stretch, trendy, cute. Breast pads move around a bit but not a deal breaker, still love"
4.0,I picked these up right before I ran a Spartan super. I have torn both my calves and can be prone to cramping. After the 9 mile race I had no calf issues. These certainly seemed to help in a big way. I could even store some energy packs in them for later in the race.
4.0,Love the fabric but it was a lil to tight
4.0,Nice summer weight top. Material is thin and flowy
4.0,"Cute casual dress. I'm 5'6&#34;, 145 lbs, 36C and the medium fit perfectly and the dress is not too short the way other reviewers described it. I recommend getting your measurements with measuring tapes and following the size guides any time you order off Amazon. My only complaint about this dress is that it's somewhat see through; however, I like to wear compression shorts or spanks under all of my dress any way and black compression shorts are perfect under this."
4.0,Nice but a bit smaller  than I  thought.
4.0,The print was larger than I expected.So because of that it gave the dress a cheaper look. A the collar is a bit short but I can work with it. Keeping it  But I don't desire another.
4.0,I little larger. I wish that an extender was added to make it a little smaller!!!!
4.0,"Decent gloves. They had a weird smell, though."
4.0,"A little small for my taste, I a tall girl..."
4.0,Very nice ones!
4.0,Very cute but the stretchy material gaps or wrinkles when you sit. In other words every time I get up I need to pull them down on my legs to make them straight. Could have used an extra small because they are so stretchy.
4.0,"I like the Hepburn Vintage Dress, but it was to small."
4.0,"My wife loves them! They fit well, are well made, and warm. Nothing not to like here."
4.0,"The face bracket works. It is a bit smaller than expected, but maybe that’s how it is designed. I think the main thing I didn’t like was the hardness of the item, but it isn’t irritating to use. I would have liked it to be a bit more flexible. It’s a good deal and my glasses don’t fog up when I use it"
4.0,"Though the product page shows this hat on a man's head, it really is best for girls.  My oldest teen looks absolutely adorable in it and she instantly claimed it.  It's a very light-weight, pressed straw hat that almost looks like a prop in that it's not a real cowboy hat but it still is super cute to wear.  The shape is perfect and the coloring is reminiscent of old-style cowboy hats of yore.  Actually, it kind of reminds me of a cowboy hat I had as a kid but this hat is not child-like."
4.0,The fabric was fairly heavy. Good for fall weather. Dress is very comfortable and stylish.
4.0,The white bars on which to write tour information are narrow. It would have been better to include a fine tip permanent marker with the product (ok to charge ore for this) as most people don't own a fine tip permanent marker.
4.0,"Good but they do frazzle faster than other ties. You get what you pay for, they look great, just don't use them a lot. Keep the rotation wide, and stick to a windsor knot and you have a nice tie."
4.0,"I bought this because it came up under a Buff headband search.  This is not a headband, it is a full size buff.  Although I would have preferred the headband, I am able to fold this up enough to make it work."
4.0,love the feel of the material. i use this as a head scarf.
4.0,"Good, but a few things to know. The buckle is a bit hard to get in the holes, they're small and hard to get through and aim for. The quick release pin on one of mine tries to spin around the wrong way making it unusable without some effort, at times, when installing it, but I have no problems removing it. Otherwise looks great and performs as expected."
4.0,"Overall, nice looking bag and great for work. It is a tight fit with a laptop in there, though."
4.0,"Good quality, fits right. The picture on it is a little dark I think"
4.0,Have not used them much for night driving yet.  My test run proved to be successful.
4.0,"I got this for one of my sons who is going through a tough time and has recently lost most of his belongings in a moving incident.  He is a big, tall man, and the size of both chain and cross pendant are a good fit.  I was afraid the chain would be too short, but he likes the length - neither long nor short.  He likes to sometimes wear it under his shirt.<br /><br />The cross has a nice weight to it, makes it feel substantial, and the blue area, while not as bright as shown, is very attractive.  The chain on the picture looks cheap , but it doesn't feel or look that way in person.  The product picture really doesn't do this justice."
4.0,"This 2 tone breathable pashmina shawl is nice and looks elegant. This is really fit to wear during work, and it can be flipped to be black with grey contour or grey with black contour. So it is like having two shawls in one. This shawl is soft and comfortable and practical. The size of this shawl is approximately 76 inches x 27 inches, so it is of a good size. Overall this is a good quality shawl."
4.0,"For the price, it is a good belt.  If I had spent 40 bucks or more...not so much.  I am not sure how well the belt will hold up, but I only where it a few times a month."
4.0,"At the moment everything is fine with the purchase, I can recommend it"
4.0,Like the item but they get dirty easier and show it more than expected.
4.0,"Great color, lasted said three shows before an accident caused a rip in the knee."
4.0,"This wallet is really great, it comes wrapped so impressively it looks great. It can hold all my credit cards, DD cards and insurance. cards without being to bulky. The zipper compartment is great for cash and odd change. Fits well in my purse and in my back pocket. My only complaint is the zipper pull snapped broke off and I need to find something to replace it. A great wallet."
4.0,"Love this! Super casual and cute. Wish the drawstring was adjustable, though."
4.0,Fit although a bit large was comfortable and length was good.  Material is stretchy and good for exercising.
4.0,Decent quality. Fit my head for my mouse costume. I sewed the tail onto my gray leotard. Super cute.
4.0,The material isn't my favorite but overall a good dress
4.0,Clarity but didn’t reduce glare or eliminate haloing.
4.0,its smaller than i thought
4.0,The outfit is really cute. It looks good on but the top is a little loose. I am 5’3” and weigh 127lbs (32D bust) and the top is loose (it doesn’t fit at the bottom
4.0,"I might actually just hang this around my desk.  It’s pretty.  Looks just like the picture.  It’s also a lot bigger and heavier than I expected (real stone?).  That said, it’s super cute.  Comes with two cords (leather and a chain) and a storage bag."
4.0,These are great if you need classy looking earrings in a flash. They tarnish after a couple of wears but for the price for a special occasion they’re not bad
4.0,In love with the color. The material is very sheer.
4.0,"She loves it. It's warm, soft and comfortable. It holds her 16lbs cat like a baby. If she were to complain at all, it would be that the ears could be a better &#34;cat shape&#34;. They seem like scrap fabric that doesn't perfectly match and it would be cuter if they perked up when she wore the hood."
4.0,"Initially it was great, and we loved it. The little bag that came in is great and pretty but after a few weeks using it, the ring broke and the pendant fell off."
4.0,This is a chunky medium weight cardigan. The color is rich wine red. I ordered a L because it mentions oversized. I could have done a XL to get the exact oversized fit I  expected. It has a hood and will be excellent during the fall.
4.0,These were super cute! Just what I expected.
4.0,Looks and fits exactly like the picture.
4.0,The dress was received on time and it fitted well
4.0,"I really like this dress, but the size was too small. The size chart said dress size 4-6 get a small. So I ordered a small and it was way too tight. I normally wear 4 or sometimes 6 dress size. I am going to order a Medium and hope it fits better. I loved the material of this dress and the style."
4.0,"This is a great travel passport pouch. It's perfect for sightseeing when you don't want to leave important documents at your hoel.  It has a deep front pocket for your passport, a roomy side pocket with zipper for your phone.  It also has a windowed pocket,  an extra zippered front pocket,  the back of pouch cabriner for keys,  you can take shoulder strap off as well if you want to be discreet and place it in jacket pocket.  It's lightweight,  material feels durable.  I highly recommend it."
4.0,I have had so many compliments on this shirt.  I usually wear medium.  i bought a large.  The undershirt was a lil baggy so i just knotted it the back.  The chiffon was long enough to cover the knot. I will order in a different color other blue (which match the skirt perfectly) .
4.0,"Lovely dress, but made in China. Order a size larger than you need. A great summer dress."
4.0,"The band does not stay tucked in as well as the original band that comes with the watch. Otherwise, great product."
4.0,"Yes, I’m enjoying it very much."
4.0,good bags for the price
4.0,Worth it if you find it cheaper than in the store. Quality and fit is fine for lounging or going out
4.0,"The watch itself is exactly what I'd expected, and very elegant. And the chain was as I'd expected,  very unattractive.  But easily replaced!"
4.0,We love them BUT.... I recommend putting them next to a dime for size reference. They are smaller than I thought they would be.
4.0,This jersey was great for the price. Be careful when washing
4.0,"The belt was the color, style and size that I ordered. I wear it often with Jeans or dress pants. I would order it again."
4.0,Really comfortable! I have worn it a few nights in a row and it blocks out all the light. The only time it shifts a little is when I sleep on my side. I had to adjust it. Over all I like them!
4.0,Light to medium thickness on dress but comfortable
4.0,"This nightgown, complimented my other two. However the neck line was a little large and had to be altered. Otherwise very nice."
4.0,"Very cute dress! The material is very silky so just be aware of that. Also, this particular dress is see through, it will require the use of a full slip. Over top of a slip though, it's perfect!"
4.0,Nice work bag and is durable
4.0,I ordered a large after reading the reviews. I should have sized up for a looser fit on top.
4.0,i’d recommend getting a size up
4.0,Me encanto!!<br />Solo k corre pequeño ☹️<br />Materiales buenos
4.0,"Cute thin jean shorts. Fyi for thick thighs, these ride up after a few steps."
4.0,Cute for costume jewelry
4.0,Some pieces came discolored and with typos.
4.0,"Great bag. I would give it exactly 4.5, but there is no such option. Great packing, everything is gentle. Good bag for such a price. I will keep it for a season.  However, I don’t love the lining inside, and inside pocket small zipper was broken. No other complains:)"
4.0,A little small but it fit well. It does not rub around the arms. Good price for the product. Would buy again.
4.0,"Its a very nice pair of earring , the quality is very good and lovely gift for a young daughter. Thank you so much ."
4.0,I liked the dress a lot but it is a see through type of fabric so that is the only reason I’m giving it four stars instead of five
4.0,"The style and quality of this jacket is excellent.  So cute and stylish.  But be warned, this is Asian styling.  Size up at least two sizes.  The jacket has some stretch to it, like jeggings but not a lot.  The largest size is probably like a good sized U.S. medium."
4.0,"Nice socks.  Thin, which is what I wanted since I will wear these for work with flats.  Relatively neutral patterns.  Great deal."
4.0,"It did what it was suppose too, my mistake was the color match not the fault of vendor. my couch was bonded leather crap which we thought at purchase was genuine leather. in the shedding parts of the recliner the spray worked perfectly but I should of taped off around the area because of the color not matching(again my fault). I would highly recommend just double check the color."
4.0,"this came to my house in less than 24 hours. the sizing is weird but the reviews were accurate, i wear a large so i got the XXXXL and it fits perfect. it's overall pretty cheaply made; very thin, the lining around the button holes was unthreading when unbuttoning, various little threads hanging off here and there. other than that though it looks good and it has a hood which is a win so i'll wear it til it falls apart."
4.0,Nice length. Pretty blue
4.0,"I bought this sweater for my daughter to wear with dresses for church. It's a pretty sweater with a nice, but subtle, detail in the knit."
4.0,"Since I look like Jaba the Hut.  I need these extenders to keep my shirt collar closed, it keeps me from coking."
4.0,"The title of the ad for these socks says “men’s hiking socks,” but it should just say “hiking socks” because these are great for ladies. The sizing description says a medium works for ladies shoe sizes 3-6, but my shoe size is an 8 and the medium fits me perfectly. The socks have elastic around the top to keep them in place, but it’s not too tight - it is very comfortable. The material is thinner in key places to keep sweat away from your feet during hiking. Cute style and nice fit. The only negative is that the instructions say to air dry, but they are cold-water machine washable (maybe they would shrink if dried in a dryer?) Overall, I really like the look and feel of the socks and look forward to hiking in them!"
4.0,"Instant favorite! Package arrived sooner than expected.<br />The material feels great against skin. The g-string back is very comfortable. The only reason for the 4 stars, is the sizing. I wear a large normally, but ordered XL due to Asian size. I wish I ordered a Large instead. I'd like it a bit more snug than what the XL offers. I guess there is more give since it's literally just a pouch."
4.0,"Works great on removing links on half inch watch bands.  I used it on two of them to remove two links and it works great. You have to hold the band and line up the punch before hitting it with a small hammer. I tried with a larger band but I didn't have much luck, but smaller bands it works just great. Yes I would recommend it for removing links on woman's watches or even men's watches."
4.0,"Perfect for my weird sense of humor.  Kind of tight, but I rock em' with pride."
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. He is really prone to burning and has very sensitive skin. He really enjoys it and it helps keep him cool, it's also funny. He gets a lot of compliments on it and it suits his goofy personality."
4.0,"This would be 5 stars except at this time (as well as when I ordered them last week), the site says cold hand/machine wash.  The tag on the pair we received says hand wash.  Hand washing wouldn't even be feasible - I mean, these are a rather stiff material - at least when they're new (I don't know if they soften up or not).  These will be washed in my machine on cold as described on the site.  If they don't do well with laundering, I'll let you know.  If I do not update, then they did fine.<br /><br />That being said, I like these and might get a pair for myself.  The material reminds of army fatigues - when they are new.  So, rough & stiff for some, but I like the feel & I believe they should soften up over time, just like fatigues.  These were purchased for my son, and the size was accurate and they look good on him.  Most pants tend to be baggy in the crotch or butt on him, because he is so skinny.  They fit well without relying on tying them at the waist, because the elastic waist is sized accurately - not one size fits all type of thing like some companies do.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase & my son really likes them.<br /><br />Update:  So, I went ahead and machine washed and dried these & they laundered fine - even softened up a bit."
4.0,Had one pair of pants a little to loose. Tried the belt with my pants and it seems like it will work just fine.  I may order another one but would get one that is 1 1/2 inches wide.  I think the wider width one would work a bit better.  Char
4.0,This is a gift and the container was broken open and the plugs were loose in the packaging.  Plugs do look great.
4.0,Fits perfectly. So many compliments.
4.0,"I was looking for a lightweight, comfortable robe to wear on cold mornings and this fits what I wanted.  Washes well and doesn’t fade."
4.0,"Nice band, great quality. The only reason for 4 stars is the color isn't quite the blue I was expecting, it looks basically black unless you really look at it."
4.0,They were not as full and fluffy as expected and. More of a baby pink than the hot pink in the picture.  But they arrived on time and served their purpose for an important show.
4.0,"More of a trunk brief than a boxer brief. They fit a little low, and are a little snug on my large thighs. Could also use a little more space in the front if you're well endowed. Like the colors though."
4.0,The recipient liked the wallet as they are a huge fan of Assassin's  Creed.
4.0,Very nice warm slippers our daughter loves
4.0,"After noticing my ankles and feet got quite swollen the last few international flights I've taken, I decided it was time for some compression socks. I'm 45 and in good shape (5' 10&#34;, 160), but for some reason my feet and ankles decided that they had had enough of things. I would take almost 2 days for the swelling to go away.<br /><br />So I tried these for the first time after reading the reviews. Socks came in the day of my flight, so I put them on right before I left for the airport. They felt a little weird, not in a bad way, but you can tell you're not wearing regular socks. The socks went all the way up to just below my knee.<br /><br />I hopped on my 11 hour flight to London, and wondered what the trip would bring.<br /><br />When I finally took my socks off in the UK, 5 hours after I landed, I was utterly amazed. There was almost no swelling in my ankles and just a little in my toes and midfoot. THe socks seemed to have compressed all the areas except the top of the foot closest to my toes. Not sure if this was an artifact of the shoes I had on (very open, almost no pressure on your feet) or if it's just hard to keep that area of one's foot from swelling.<br /><br />Regardless, I was very happy with my purchase and will be wearing these on all my international flights in the future."
4.0,I bought this bodysuit in the color black size small and it fit me perfectly. I have lost weight since buying this bodysuit but when I bought and wore it I was 126 pounds and I'm 5'1. It's really cute paired with jeans and cute booties like in my picture!
4.0,The lace wasn't attached on one shoulder. Easy fix. I would have given it 5 ☆ if not for the lace not attached properly.
4.0,"A bit narrow. My feet are borderline on needing wide or regular. Sometimes I find I need a wide but some regulars are fine. In this case the length of the 13 I ordered is fine, but the toe box is tight. A wide size is needed here. If you have a normal to narrow foot, this will be perfect, but if you are borderline, you need something wider."
4.0,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DKHGDB4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br /><br />The guide says the product runs smaller than expected, so I ordered a size larger than I normally wear.  I easily would have needed two or possibly three sizes larger.  I am a DD and it would not zip up the back very well."
4.0,Did not get the free N95 mask as stated in the description.
4.0,Fit great and lots of pockets. Even small ones for small items.
4.0,Had to bend it around a little to stay up in my ear. But now that it stays I love it!<br />Many compliments
4.0,"My Mom says this feels heavy on her chest.  On the other hand, it is close to indestructible, and that's why I bought it for her."
4.0,Great costume. My husband who is 6 ft and about 190 lbs wore it. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars because the face part was kind of tight but we just cut a slit and made more room so it was more comfortable.
4.0,"These gloves are snug, as new leather gloves should be. The leather is lovely and soft. They are long enough in the fingers (which usually doesn't happen with gloves I try on) and the lining makes them feel a bit warmer.  They are very nice-looking gloves - suitable for a slightly more formal appearance than some gloves I've seen on the shelves lately.  I have only had these for a week and am very happy with them so far.  The only negative, and it's very minor, is that the way they were packaged caused the thumb to imprint on the leather of the palm of the hand of both gloves - you can definitely see the outline of where the glove's thumb was when it was packed/stored. It doesn't negatively impact the purpose of the glove, and it's relatively unnoticeable once the gloves are on. I've seen this with several pairs of leather gloves I've purchased from Amazon, so I don't know but that it's just one of those ""Amazon"" things that happen. I would still buy them again, even with that minor flaw. Especially at this price!"
4.0,Bought this for my 1 year old but it was a bit small. It did fit a little better after his first haircut. But still haven't used it much. It is cute though.
4.0,"Glasses have nice style and, being lightweight and surprisingly coming with flex temps, are fairly comfortable to wear.  However, lightweight comes with a price.  These glasses are quite fragile.  At $7.67 what I paid the last 2 times, l figured the glasses to be disposable and lost 3 pair and broke another 2 pair in less than a year.  Now at $11.99, I'm going to have to be more careful!"
4.0,"You get what you pay for, its a great hat for temps 40 degrees or warmer but I wouldn’t wear it skiing in 20/30 degree weather."
4.0,"I love the shirt, however it does run small. I'm short and stocky. I normally wear a 2X and they fit fine. This shirt fit like a 2X up top and an XL around the mid section. However.... it motivated me to lose some belly because I love the shirt and HAVE to wear it"
4.0,Empire waist is too tight.
4.0,Size chart said I was a Large. Bought X Large after reading reviews to buy one size up. The X Large fit like all my other shirts. The shirt irons perfectly and easily with a light spray starch. Good looking shirt. Got lots of compliments. Price lower than comparable shirt. Will buy again in different color.<br />Shirt arrived several days before estimated delivery date.
4.0,"The shirt is beautiful, but it’s really long. I ordered a large because I don’t like shirts to tight. After I dried it, it was a little better but still pretty long. Better to long then to short!"
4.0,This is just too cute. Looks and feel great.
4.0,I have another that firs perfect. The under short is tight around the legs. My other is not. Other wise I love these skirts!
4.0,The slit of the wrap dress opens up when wind blows exposing underwear.
4.0,Definitely order a size up.
4.0,liked the first one so much had to get another
4.0,"I have a hard time finding dresses that are flattering to my pear shaped body.  I am 5ft 10 and 170 pounds and ordered a size medium and it fits perfect. The cinched waist and overall length looks good on my size 12-14 body.  The fabric is soft but not too clingy.  Would recommend, especially for the price."
4.0,"This was a gift purchased for my mother in law. She asked for a lightweight, soft, 3/4 sleeve, mid calf robe. Not picky at all, right? The description of the robe said it had the sleeve length she wanted, but i find them to be more like a t-shirt. She really likes the robe so we're happy with it. The softness is probably the most surprising thing, for the price. I may order one for myself!"
4.0,"Great for Tai Chi class, very soft, no spandex. Runs a little large, but nothing a little time in the dryer won’t fix."
4.0,Runs very small.  I usually wear a size (USA) 12 or 14 and the 2X is too small.  Shoulders fit but it does not close in front.
4.0,"This is what I wanted in a travel rain jacket:  packable, thin, with a waist, hood, and pockets.  I would give it 4.75 stars, if I could, but not 5 because the only thing it is lacking is elastic at the sleeves which would make it perfect. The sleeves are a bit open, but nothing too serious..I am going to put my own elastic in..."
4.0,"A very good value for a great price. Just started using them, they seem sturdy and fit easily in my purse."
4.0,"The low rise is perfect for this trunk. I was not sure what ""dual pouch"" meant. It means there is a hole in the front of the trunk that allows you to slide through. There is a second layer so you are not exposed, but it is a bit of an odd design."
4.0,Cute! Very nice for summer
4.0,"These are actually nice. I had low expectations considering it's one of these products sold from many different Chinese companies that are usually all a bit different from one another, but they're not bad. I am 5'10&#34; 130 lb and I ordered the Chinese size XL. They are surprisingly long enough and really do fit. A bit higher waisted than I imagined, but you can roll down the waist band if you need."
4.0,easy to lose wish it had an optional clasp
4.0,"I took a chance on a $15 suit and I'm so glad I did. It's just what I was looking for. I knew the top wouldn't work because of the style, it fits well but I need more support unless I were to be sunbathing and not actively swimming. I'm 5'7&#34;, 158lbs, 36DD, and pant size 10-12, I ordered an XL.  The bottom is adorable and cover my baby pouch, the color is great and I can mix and match with my other tops!"
4.0,Pretty good product overall. It’s not mind blowing in its materials or anything but it’s a cute sweater that helps me stay a little more hands free with my 10lbs chihuahua.
4.0,Too large at. The bust
4.0,This sweatshirt is true to size. It is nice and thick for cold weather. I love the gold and black. Happy I purchased it.
4.0,Works well with a scarf.
4.0,"Nice, but I have very small wrists so it's a bit big."
4.0,"I've had this set for a few months and many are broken, but it's a good deal for the price!"
4.0,It’s a bit thick around my wrist but I am hoping it loosens so I don’t feel the thickness around my wrist. I was expecting Snoopy’ color being bolder and darker but it’s ok.
4.0,"I loved it, the pants fit fine the top is ok but tight on the arms.<br />The colors are not as btight but is ok for the price. I hope it doesn't fade more after washing it. Otherwise it does meet my expectations."
4.0,Too bad they are a bit small and shrink fast...
4.0,I love the wallet.  It's just what I was looking for.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it has a terrible smell to it.  I am trying to get rid of the smell so I can use the wallet.
4.0,Not comfortable; but pretty
4.0,"Super cute, had an issue with the first band but the company is sending a replacement!"
4.0,"It was slightly smaller than I expected, but overall very nice and very appreciated as a gift. Was the perfect gift for my wife."
4.0,I got a medium way too small. I love the material.
4.0,"worked really well for what i needed, I would buy them again."
4.0,The quality is spot on. The color is beautiful!
4.0,"Good quality for the money, smart looking, but runs smaller than the size given. Order one size larger than you normally would"
4.0,It is a bit rough on the edges
4.0,"Nice ring, but I don't like the band. True to size. The stones are glued so my ring has glue on top of a few of the stones. It discolored a few of the stones on the side. It bothers me but not enough to return."
4.0,Frames are nice
4.0,"This is a good, light reflective jacket. After just a little use, the inside pocket ripped where the battery goes, but it hasn't really affected the functionality"
4.0,Great quality. Was disappointed with packaging. Hat came very wrinkled. Over still happy and wear it all the time
4.0,"Even though I ware a med, I had read the reviews that it runs small. I ordered a lg and it fits decent.  Just a bit unfitted at shoulder.  Material is nice, haven't wore it out and about yet so not sure if will snag easy. Color perfect"
4.0,"It's ok ...just not what I expected it was kinda stiff feeling, and not too comfy to wear. But then again it isn't silicone so I should have expected that."
4.0,Fit well and not too difficult to get on.  Good grip and keep my feet warm.
4.0,"Took a long time to receive this product, but they are now here and fit perfectly. Even got a courtesy call from China apologizing for the delay."
4.0,These are pretty nice.  I am hoping that they will stretch out so I can wear them more.
4.0,Too big for 11 year old.
4.0,"I absolutely love the pendant with the dancing diamond.  It sparkles with every move.  The only problem is the chain size included in this purchase.  The clasp is extremely tiny  and even with small hands, it is impossible to hook around my neck.  I cannot even hook it when it is off my neck.  I wouldn't feel safe wearing this chain if I could manage to get it on.  It is so thin I would be afraid it would break.  I would suggest a thicker chain with a workable size clasp or sell the pendant only without the chain."
4.0,"I am 5' 8"" and ordered the medium size. The legs are a good 6"" too long for me. Will probably return. Too bad, the quality seems to be pretty good for the $, though the hood is only attached to coat around the back of neck"
4.0,"These are way too small to be smalls. My mom also bought these in smalls and as you can see, the pair I received was significantly smaller even though we ordered the exact same size and style. Would be cute if the pants fit!<br /><br />I contacted the seller and they quickly apologized and offered a refund so the communication with the customer service was great!"
4.0,"Smaller than expected, but gets the job done (that’s what she said)."
4.0,My 3rd grader was very happy with his mask. As we hesitantly returned to in-person learning he said it fit well and for the most part stayed up without falling often. It was comfortable enough to wear all day even when outside doing exercise.
4.0,"Size small, 130 pounds 5’5” fit snug but good for working out. Normally a small so that’s what I ordered, I’m ok with a snug fit."
4.0,"much paler than the product listing, and the red isn't red, but overall i'd say the quality is good. the orange and yellow are also blacklight reactive."
4.0,"After reading the reviews I sized up for my daughter two sizes and it fit her perfectly then. Was it worth the price I paid for it? No, not as high quality as I was expecting for the price. However, she loved it, so in reality it was worth it. Took almost four weeks to receive though."
4.0,"Bought this for my gamer son. I haven’t given it to him yet because it’s for Christmas. However, I did inspect it upon delivery. Great material and really nice shirt for a great amount. I can’t wait to give it to him."
4.0,You have to figure out how to attach the buttons yourself and the sticker stache kept falling off but they gave extras.
4.0,I dislike the fact that the color of this set is much lighter in color than pictured on your site.
4.0,"This sock are at least as thick as they look online. Super soft even after washing.  Not scratchy in the least. I normally have cold feet in winter but I never noticed it while wearing these socks. Mostly, I've worn these around the house, either just the sock or in house slippers. In that role they are a 5 out of 5, solid. They lost a star because while I've only worn them with shoes (out of the house around town) they are showing some 'fluffing' (like a piece of Velcro got a hard hold on them and started to pull it apart when separated). They are comfortable in shoes, very fluffy so not binding like you'd get from very heavy socks, but not very cushiony either. I would definitely buy again for around the house, and probably will next winter. But I'd be very hesitant to wear on a hike or prolonged day (10+hrs). I don't think they'd hold up that well.  I'll update as I wear them. Had them about a month right now."
4.0,Comfortable and soft. The shorts are a little too short for me. But I do still like the set.
4.0,"Good meaning behind it. Chain is a little bulky, but it is durable. Charms can always be put on another bracelet if need be."
4.0,This is a bill made dress but it is big. I wear a xxl normally. I’m 5’3” and about 210 and this xxl was too big. I could have tightened the bodice but then There was waaay too much fabric bunched up in the middle. I ultimately went another direction with my costume I would have went with an xl and tbh could have probably worn a large
4.0,"It's a very cute hand bag, was hoping for it to be slightly bigger on the inside. The attachment for the cross body holder broke off."
4.0,They fit my feet perfectly.  I was able to exercise without slipping on my hardwood floors.
4.0,My daughter hasn't work it yet but it looks like it will fit. I like how it looks
4.0,"I really do love these dresses. I ordered a burgundy and a black. I initially wasn’t sure about the burgundy but now I actually love it more than the black one. They are the perfect summer time casual dress and the fabric has a nice weight to it while still being cool and breezy! I actually wear it off of both shoulders and have gotten so many compliments! I only wish it was a bit longer...I’m 5’8 and although it’s just below my ankles, I actually prefer my maxi dresses to be teeny bit longer ...otherwise...it’s awesome!"
4.0,I like the bracelet but 2 months later I have lost two of the six magnets.
4.0,Cute but straps were a tight.. if have a fat/flat foot shoe will not fit
4.0,Bought these when COVID just stared they were tight and we never used them.
4.0,"For the price, the product is good. I love the color. I wish the frame was more durable."
4.0,Fit was brilliant 👏.  I adore this shirt.
4.0,This was exactly what I expected. Don't know where everybody gets the notion that it is much smaller than it appears because to me it's plenty big.
4.0,"Take this out of the package and let it hang so it can straighten out. Otherwise it'll be all bunched up. They look great, I haven't worn them yet because it's for Halloween but I'm glad that I took it out of the bag to it can straighten out."
4.0,I like the look but the buttons are not intuitive at all.
4.0,Love this! It is very soft. I bought a medium but honestly could probably do a small will definitely order more.
4.0,"the hat was really crammed in the bot which made it have some dents, but it will be fine. There was a black smudge on the white bracelet and there was a WAP sticker that they shouldn't put there, someone that doesn't know what it means might use it. But overall I recommend this its a good price!!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a5c034c479414ea3bc0c17ae2a563dc9]] Esta diadema está hermosa, el color de las piedras resalta muy bien y hace el duo perfecto con el color negro satinado. Me encanta porqué esta diadema es delicada, diferente y muy hermosa, además tiene una apariencia de hecho a mano que lo convierte en el regalo perfecto. Lo más que me gusta es que es cómoda, no aprieta ni molesta."
4.0,A Lil bit for my 9 yr old but she Wil  grow into it
4.0,Runs a bit big but otherwise exactly as described.  If you're debating size go down not up. I like the uniqueness of the front zip and 3/4 length sleeves.
4.0,"Nice belt! Very pretty - fits well, the only thing I would mention is that if your waist is towards the upper end of the range the clasp pops open occasionally. Overall fantastic belt and I would buy another."
4.0,Beautiful necklace at a great price! Only downside was a piece had fallen off but I was able to repair it.
4.0,Good quality and Less expensive that the original shirts.
4.0,"they were a gift, she likes them. not much to say."
4.0,"They went well with my dress, the reason I bought them.  They are not soft, a little on the stiff side, but overall I like them."
4.0,"I'll give it 4 stars because it was true to size. BUT, things I dislike about it: the print on the top looks like bad screen print, and the cups are placed a little further apart then I'm used to (easy fix if you know how to sew). Lastly, the straps that go around you and clip in the back are very thin, little to no support there. But I do like the fact the the top has adjustable straps.<br />The bottoms fit great and overall I do like the suit. Just need to make a few tweeks."
4.0,"These glasses are awesome, except one of my pairs came broken."
4.0,I like it. I wish the elastic band is a little bit longer so it won't be too tight on the head.
4.0,"Soft, cute, daughter loves them."
4.0,Best price I have found for this product
4.0,These glasses are adorable and perfect for costuming. They are obscenely big though and they aren’t the most durable glasses.
4.0,My child loves it.  Fits as stated and good quality.
4.0,"This is a nice long beach dress, great for taller gals. I'm 5' 4 150 lbs and it drags even in 2 inch wedge flip flops. The fabric is soft and color is just like in picture. This is beach wear, VERY see through. I didn't care for the neckline on me, but it is a nice scoop neck.  Over all it was large ( I bought small) and loose, very comfy, one really has to be in a comfy baggy mood. The leg slits are substantial just like the picture shows. I don't know if it will shrink because I haven't laundered it yet, will do so before cutting length, might cut into V-neck while II'm at it. Wish they had more Summer like colors, earth tones in Summer meh...."
4.0,arrived plenty of time for Xmas my daughter loved it.
4.0,Been using it for a bit now.  Very durable.  I throw it around a lot.  Great value
4.0,"Adorable skirt, but does run a bit big"
4.0,"Very nice watch<br />Useful functions<br />You could do recreative diving<br />Don't have instructions but you can found it easy on Casio website<br />I agree with another costumers, is not easy read digital numbers, but not impossible.<br />G shock watches are very durables"
4.0,Does not fit an adult head.
4.0,"Good looking watch for the price. Saved myself a few thousand from buying a britling navitimer. Only 2 issues, (1) the bezel looks cheap, doesn't look of quality. (2) the band needs a extra hold punched out so people with smaller wrists can wear this watch easily."
4.0,Didn’t really cover my butt.
4.0,"Love the racerback, and the material is light and breathable for those rough work outs.."
4.0,Muy cómodas. Igual que como se ve en la imagen. Tienen que invertir en un estuche de presentación; pues viene en una funda de plástico.
4.0,Great material but does run a bit small
4.0,It's cute and well made but runs way to large.
4.0,"I liked the dress, the belt really brings it all together"
4.0,Nice and thick. Runs small.
4.0,Order a size up if you want a loose fit. Very comfortable!
4.0,I am 5'3 and some change and 121 lbs. Extremely lightweight. The quality doesnt feel long lasting but it's presentable.<br /><br />My biggest issue was the zipper does not fold over far enough so you can easily see it.
4.0,"It's good, it's cheap and it has style.<br />I still don't know if the thermometer works properly but so far it`s great"
4.0,"Great quality material - it's pretty heavy and the look is really cute. I knocked off a star for 2 reasons:<br /><br />1. I'm 5&#34; 2' so the dress is wayyyy too long on me. I look like a nun! Now deciding whether I want to shell out the cash to have it altered or just return and buy another dress.<br /><br />2. The bottom is a thick, heavy material. Some may like this but it is a little too stiff. Could improve with fabric softener though."
4.0,"The winder does not make a sound. Watch fits, plugged in and it worked. There were no instructions or details as to what the settings were, but for now I suppose it doesn't matter.<br />Four settings A,B,C,D and Left, Right and Automatic."
4.0,"Was fed up with losing or breaking $30 sunglasses.  Used these for a couple rides, and it does the job.  Feels like it would break the first time I put it in the wrong place, however, so far so good."
4.0,Nice product just didn't fit my son so had to return.
4.0,"Beautiful skirt bad but stuck zipper. This skirt is truly beautiful! I really like it but to get the zipper down and back up was so hard.  I really struggled with it, it may just be this one skirt and hopefully not the rest? But I am returning it because I see it breaking in the near future.<br />But what I love about this skirt?<br />Reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn<br />Has side pockets<br />Really is great for someone with an hour glass or pear shaped figure<br />Fit my figure really well (I ordered a small and am 5'5, 110 lbs 26 inch waist)<br />Great quality - shiny material - very dressy looking<br />Classic look<br />Nice contrast to the skin tight looking club skirts out there<br />Dislike?<br />The zipper got stuck!"
4.0,"I received this bag sooner than expected, which is always great. Ok, to start, this bag is a really nice looking bag and appears to be good quality material. It has several external pockets for storage and a larger drawstring opening inside that holds lots more. It fits my wallet, car keys, my .380, cell phone, charger, keys and badge for work, lip gloss, and a small makeup bag. I work on the go and this is a great cross body bag that keeps my hands free. I highly recommend this bag for anyone trying to carry essentials but keep it light at the same time. The adjustable strap is also a plus so that it hangs comfortably at my hip. I love it."
4.0,"After going through many gazebos, we decided to try umbrellas .<br />This one is great... its huge and provides a ton of shade.<br />It has a crank handle that names its easy to put up or close down<br />My only complaint is that the hand crank is a little wonky and I expect that to crap out long before the umbrella itself.<br />For the price, it was a good buy. And def already outlasted all our gazebos."
4.0,Simple and cute but feels cheap
4.0,"Purchased an xl for my hubby and other than being a little smaller/tighter than expected, he really likes them. They are a nice lightweight material, allowing easy movement while biking. The padding seems to be sufficient for what he was looking for."
4.0,"I don’t think it’s original, but it served it’s purpose. It was for my son, but it has bright pink stripes, so my daughter is using it instead. (7-8 size)."
4.0,very cute and worth the money.
4.0,These compression socks work as expected! They provide excellent compression and they do not roll down like other compression socks!
4.0,Doesn’t come with a battery pack
4.0,"Works well, if this was a bit more stylish, I'd have given it the 5th star."
4.0,Was a good fight for a something blue. Just was a little  wider color blue then expected.
4.0,Very pleased with this product. I wear them everyday.  Exactly what I was looking for and the price was very good.
4.0,"First, I want to point out that these are NOT authentic DG glasses, so it would be unrealistic to expect the same product for a fraction of the price. For the product and the price, it is a good product. If the glasses don't fit your head or face, that's not an issue with the glasses. It's an issue with your anatomy….find another pair that suits you. The only thing that I do not like is the DG on the case….it's not cute to me. But, other than that…good pair of KOCK-OFF's (Let's not forget that people). I would purchase again."
4.0,There pretty cool but they barely fit my neck
4.0,I liked the short casual look and the floaty feeling of the lightweight comfort.<br />I would wear it again and again.  It's a good buy.
4.0,Hat is both attractive and practical.
4.0,"Very comfortable and require little breaking in, ordered half a size smaller and fits perfectly. colour however is much darker than the pictures shown. Would give a 5 start if the colour was brown instead of dark brown"
4.0,I love the fit.. very thin tho.. I wore mine in the night so I didn’t have to wear under garments.
4.0,Good one comes with picks
4.0,"Basically you get what you see pictured. I bought these for a quick costume idea and they worked for what I needed. They're nothing spectacular and they shed, but if you need something cheap and simple they're great!"
4.0,"I like them, but they run a bit large.  They say tummy control, but too big for that.  Still like them though."
4.0,"Hard sided cases as mobile office have been hard to find.  Would prefer a better handle to pick it up, but otherwise I'm happy with this.<br />The directions about unlocking this were unclear and ended up with the first permanently locked, so had to have it replaced, which was done very efficiently."
4.0,"Night vision glasses work, but not in all circumstances for me. They work great in overcast weather or early evening or right before sunrise. Once it’s really dark outside in my opinion they make little difference."
4.0,Nice... fit well and are flattering.
4.0,Love this eyeshadow!! So pretty & I love the colors!! You'll need a good primer though for the sparkles to stay!  But that was expected!! Highly recommend this!
4.0,Awesome for the price.  Well made.  Hope the watch lasts.  Bought for gifts for young teenage girls
4.0,"Pattern is nice but if you’re planning on using it in place of a protective mask, may want to look elsewhere. Light shines through when double layered (gaiter is actually single layered). Each end of the tube is unfinished. Fabric is not extremely stretch which may help holding it up over your face but could be difficult to get on if you have a big head. Overall it looks nice and is appropriate for the cost. Probably will be fine as an outdoor shield."
4.0,"Looks really nice. Looks like a car tire and it was a gift for s teenager who loves cars, so it was well received. It is very thin, much thinner then expected, not in width, but in thickness. So seems a bit cheep, I guess you get what you pay for."
4.0,"Due to my not being totally familiar with the Oakley models, the lenses and accessories did not fit my Oakley Radar frame. There was no paperwork with the items defining the return process. The items were as described in the add."
4.0,Love the wallet and glasses. Purse is nice too but is a little small for me.
4.0,"These pants are great! Not too thick or too thin. Very comfy and modest for yoga class. I sized down because several reviewers suggested to, but I wouldn't have needed to. I'm 5'6&#34; 118lbs and the XS is a little tight, especially around the cuff. Small would have been better, but I'm not going to bother with an exchange. I'll just keep it in mind for the next time I order a pair...which I definitely will be doing!"
4.0,It looks just like the photo on here so you get what you wanted. It is a little too big but not excessively. I bought an XL by the way. Shipped in about one week or less.
4.0,Nice but they were a little tight!
4.0,"I bought these to see how I would like to get a septum, and they worked well! If you're wondering whether or not to get a piercing, I would get one of these boxes and see what you like."
4.0,"I dropped my review from 5 to 4 stars only because the material is thin. With tights and a nude bra it is fine, but I usually prefer dress material to be heavier. The dress is very flattering, soft, and stretchy. I'm 5'11"" and usually wear a size 6 dress, and the medium fits perfect. I ordered the blue/grey dress, but the ""grey"" is really more of a greyish-brown. I paired it with some light tan booties and a blue cardigan. Super cute for work!"
4.0,"Warning- do not buy this skirt if expecting a looser  a-line fit unless you are a size 0. My size can vary from 4 to 8- I ordered a 10 and if is pretty snug. The fit is hip hugging. The skirt, however, is actually very cute, despite it not being what I expected. My advice is to size up and look at product pictures before ordering. Otherwise, really cute and a great steal!"
4.0,"It looks pretty much exactly like the photo. It is not really puffy. It is not super expensive looking. The under part is a tiny bit sheer, but overall- not bad for the price."
4.0,it is a really nice dress...
4.0,"I don't consider myself to be very tall (5' 7&#34;) but the front of this hit just at my waist and not as low as depicted on the model.  It still looked very cute and seems very well made, but when I raise my arms, my tummy shows.  If you have a high waist or are petite, this will probably fit as shown.  Even with it being shorter than expected, I really like it.  The fit in the chest and arms was exactly what I expected."
4.0,Really pretty watch and numbers large enough to read.  Quite elegant for the price as well.  Very pleased.
4.0,"I lost lots of weight and NEEDED new business dresses or church dresses.  This was a bit long for me at 5'3"" but I like its fit otherwise."
4.0,This is super cute. There are not many cute boys clothes that are also trendy. This fits the bill. Now my son looks just as cute as his sister.
4.0,"I bought the white t-back version to wear under white/summer halter dresses. I’m nursing, so I didn’t want anything with underwire, but I need lots of support! It works perfectly for my needs. As others have said, it runs small. I ordered L and I’m 34DDD, so I’ll try XL if I order the black one. Overall, I REALLY love it"
4.0,"This is a very pretty brooch, however much larger than you think it is. I wish that they would have sizes along with description. Packed nicely, shipped promtly"
4.0,"Cute, decent quality for the price. I'm 5'5&#34;, 125 pounds, 36 b/c and ordered a small. It fits great. The material is see-through and it's unlined, so you'll need to wear a slip underneath. I wore Spanx underneath mine just to keep everything in :) Overall good purchase"
4.0,Great price that I immediately bought two. They have a good selection of colors and styles and the material is light. Also very easy to iron. I wasn’t a fan of the double pockets. They compete too much with the shoulder stripes/design and make the shirts too busy.
4.0,"little heavy, but nice and works great"
4.0,"Loved these hat! Worth the price and they look so good, I got two!"
4.0,"Super cute dress. Runs true-to-size, but I ordered the 4-5 and it fits more like a 5. The entire dress is very lightweight yet not see-through, so it’s perfect for hot summer days. The waistband area is nice and stretchy so it’s easy to get into and take off. I do wish the metallic stars on the skirt were silver instead of gold, as I think silver would compliment the blue tones much better now that I’ve seen it in person. Really cute though for a $14 dress!"
4.0,A little wide feels like it could slide off very soft& comfortable though
4.0,perfecto a mi cuerpo
4.0,All the bracelets are very pretty but it's a little too big and I wish it came in a smaller size . It is definitely over 8 inches in diameter so if you need something smaller then this is probably not the right product .
4.0,"These came in a nice box that could easily be giftable, and the bras were nicely arranged therein. The bras are all very nicely made, beautiful colors (exactly as listed/expected). I used the photo sizing guide provided in the listing and ended up with a perfect fit for me (Normaly 34D, chose M).<br /><br />They are quite comfortable, except...<br />What you can't see in their listing photos is that the straps are fully removable, and that means there is a clasp right where the lacey part ends and the adjustable strap to the back begins. For me, this clasp lands right on my collar bone, and it's not very comfortable. It's not bad, it's just not great.<br /><br />But this does add a bonus they haven't quite shown in this listing - the bra is convertable into a halter style too...<br /><br />Overall, I think this set is a great value. If you're not as sensitive as I am (I'm the 'no tags, soft things only' kinda gal), then the clasps probably won't bother you at all."
4.0,"This swimsuit is adorable!  I haven't tried it in the water yet, and I'm a bit concerned that it will be translucent, but I love the style.  I am petite, and was worried it would be overwhelming on my small frame (short torso), but it looks great.<br /><br />The top is exceptionally molded, and I'm bigger on the bottom than the top, so I do have to pull it pretty tight so it doesn't gape.  For the price, though, it can't be beat!"
4.0,"Love the style, but poorly finished off. Lots of threads hanging off seams."
4.0,I would size up I got this for my husband in his normal size and it was to small so definitely size up.
4.0,I was perfectly happy with the actual bracelet.  I was disappointed that it did not come with the signature black velvet Alex And Ani bag & card inside.  This was a gift so it was important to have those expected items with the bracelet.
4.0,I was looking for an under shirt that would snugly fit but not be too compressive. This works great. I feel the support without feeling like it is pushing everything out the holes or squeezing the life out of me. Overall a pretty great find! I am fairly tall and they fit right at my midsection.
4.0,Great teacher gift. Super cute. My daughters pre k teacher loved Pete the cat. This was perfect.
4.0,Nice feel and great color match to the picture
4.0,Liked the necklace. Couple of stones were out. Having to glue back in. Packaging could have been better to keep that from have happening.
4.0,These fit fine.  So far they have kept their shape and size.  Good value.
4.0,I can’t say I love the Agutiun 2 piece yoga set but it’s nice.  The top it’s a little tight but not so tight I can’t wear it during a workout.  Doesn’t seem like it has a ton of support for high impact activity but that’s ok.  The bottoms almost look like denim pants.
4.0,'could be less structured and slightly lower crown
4.0,"Great material. Reordering a size up, I picked large but was to snug  (38 bust)"
4.0,"It was an alright set, but the cufflinks seemed a lot longer than what seems necessary."
4.0,"These gloves keep my hands very warm when it's in the single digits outside. I have another brand that started fraying almost immediately, but these seem to be good quality, although the touchscreen feature doesn't work as well as I hoped it would. I can certainly still use my phone while wearing these, but I usually have to press my pointer finger pretty hard for it to work. Definitely worth $10 versus bare-handed texting in freezing temperatures."
4.0,"Pretty good. It's too big for me. I'm not small. (5'11"", 170, middle aged, with 4 kids).....<br />And the tightest snap is still very loose"
4.0,Fits true to size and I wear it with leather pants and it looks great. Dress up or down.
4.0,Love the dress. The dress is well made. The fabric is has stretch to it so it hugs you in the right places. The length hits me at the knee. The belt was cute but it was a bit too long.
4.0,I wear a men's medium and the foot part isn't bad it's just that they only come up like 3 inches to my ankles. I like the texture and they are made fine but way too short. Maybe I'll try the large next time.
4.0,Great gloves. Just sized a little small. But gave them to my girlfriend who loves them!
4.0,They would be fine on textured straps... out so much on lightweight ones
4.0,Very pretty- package was somewhat crushed on arrival. But Fascinator could be straightened to most of its original  shape
4.0,Have to tighten them a lot by bending them and they do come out in sleep pretty easily
4.0,I like the fact that doesn't have subdued watch almost military and style with railroad tracks running around the edge I would have liked to seen a little bit more I want a plied marker but other than that it's all great why doesn't get five stars it's the citizen miyota movement while it's accurate its Workhorse and it's noisy. But I find if you keep the watch wound it's not so bad
4.0,"As per my wife she says ""This sweater is super cute no doubt. the black heart in the center is definitely the spot light and its pretty."" another pro is that it is nice and soft which is always nice.<br /><br />However, I have a bit of trouble with the material. I had bought a previous one that was grey and white and it had such amazing texture that I decided to give this one a try. This sweater is not only see through but I feel that if I was it it wont make it out. If you want to use this just a couple of times because its cute then this is for you."
4.0,"I like the fit, coverage, support, and color options. But something about it is cheap and squeaks in the material. I can’t describe the sound properly, but it makes noises when it moves and I’m not thrilled about it. It’s too bad because the fit is really nice."
4.0,Good quality sweats but fit a little tight from what I am used to getting in these types of pants. Might stretch out a bit with use. Otherwise happy with them.
4.0,"better quality than expected, and is very practical as well.  was a big hit!"
4.0,"the acrylic beads and silicon balls do feel a little cheap they’re not super well made, but i think u get what u pay for. this is the second time i’ve bought this because i figured it’d be different jewelry but it was pretty much the same both times (still cute tho). the balls w the silicon spikes are pretty poorly made tho they look very messy. but the jewelry hasn’t made any of my piercings infected or irritated"
4.0,The pants  are exactly like the picture. The pants fit well and looked cute with my daughters dress
4.0,The post are a little to long and poke you if you forget to take them off at night. The upside is you can double the backings to make them more secure.
4.0,"Pro:<br />comfortable<br />grippy<br />reinforced where needed: pinky and thumb<br /><br />con:<br />took a long time to get the smell of the &#34;rubberized dots&#34; to air out.  Even now, they still smell, but it is tolerable.  hand washed them many times.  My hands smell like the gloves after a concert."
4.0,Quite nice but white was a little more see-through than I would prefer but works
4.0,Nice jacket. Runs a little big. Will fit fine if hoodie is worn under it.
4.0,The sandals are a bit too small for me. They do not fit like a U.S. size &#34;13&#34; that I am accustomed to. But more like a European fit. The positive for these shower shoes is they are lightweight and functional in the shower.
4.0,Love the quality of them. A little bigger than I was expecting but they are a great price. Surgical steel is great for sensitive ears.
4.0,Nice glasses but not what was ordered. Silver frames & silver lenses were ordered.
4.0,It’s a nice dress! A really cute baby pink color. It does fit really big. I am usually an XL and ordered and XL but it was way too big. I returned it and got a L and that also fit very loose. It is also longer than expected but owe all I liked it.
4.0,Very cute! My daughter loved it. 4 stars because it was a little lower than I expected in the front.
4.0,"Oversized just as I like, however the neck part is way to bunching, I feel like im wearing a turtle neck and the thickness is not there for a sweatshirt like this, its kind of thin for my liking.  I live in CA so now I cant wear it until it gets cold again lmao"
4.0,good product at a fair price!
4.0,The order size is a little off.  Thanks to a review I read I ordered a size smaller than was suggested and I'm glad I did. I've only been using the corset for less than 1 week.  At first it was difficult to put on and tighten and was very uncomfortable to wear.  Took a couple of days to get adjusted.  I'm actually pleased with the corset.  I wear it at least 8 hours a day.  I tried wearing it at night but it was too uncomfortable. Some websites suggest not wearing the corset at night and others say it's ok.  I guess it's your preference.  I wear it as soon as I wake up in the morning and adjust it throughout the day (tightening/loosening).  I haven't had it long enough to see any results but I have a feeling it was worth the buy.
4.0,Perfect for a Normal rider
4.0,"Very cute, very comfortable blouse. I got it in black and in xxl even though I usually wear l. It does run very small. I would order more colors if it didn't take a month to get. I took a star off for the fact that it runs so small and the extra long ship time."
4.0,"The costume overall was great for the money.  The beard was a little skimpy, but okay.  I was “Bad Santa”, so it worked fine."
4.0,This runs a bit big but still a comfy fit.
4.0,Love It. so cute and elegant!
4.0,"The seems are a little to thick and you can tell where the fabric changes over.  But, the shirt is very comfortable and looks great with leggings."
4.0,strong construction
4.0,"Adorable bag but a tad small for my 11 year old. She likes it and it basically does the job, but it did appear bigger in the site. Probably great for dancers ages 3-9."
4.0,"I like this thing. This just arrived with 2-day prime shipping! Unlike similar but cheaper scarves (e.g. $10), this did NOT have a scary chemical smell. The material is soft yarn and the charcoal grey is darker than the picture: very pretty and contemporary. I'm 5'2&#34; and 100 lbs, usually a size 0, 00, XS or XXS petite in the US. So on me, this thing could have been smaller and I'd be happy. I think it would drape nicely over your shoulders if you're upto a size S regular or size 4, but if your shoulders are wider than that this will not wrap around your shoulders and still drape: it'll probably be too small, or just annoying. An Asian &#34;one size fits all&#34; is very different from a Caucasian one-size-fits all."
4.0,I loved the dress. However I ordered one size up because I'm pretty tall and didn't want it to be too short. I'm 5'7 and 180 lbs if that helps. Sleeves a little tight but nothing major. Received lots of compliments
4.0,whomever said these run a little long was correct. i bought 45&#34; for a standard men's size 10.5 tennis shoe and it's perfect.
4.0,"It was a bit too large, but pretty.  Very light weight, but not see through.  I will keep it and take it in so I can wear it.  Perfect length just above the knee."
4.0,My granddaughter is going to look so sweet in this!
4.0,"A beautiful, modestly priced necklace that my wife loves."
4.0,"I had this hat on for 12, maybe 13 seconds total.  It was nice for those 12-13 seconds, but then someone knocked it off my head and it went floating away in the lake that I was traversing in.  My face and head took a beating from the sun that day.  T'was a nice hat tho."
4.0,Love the tunic.  A little snug
4.0,"The tie straps are a bit thin, but I have not had a problem when I wear this top. This product is definitely a steal for the price . There is padding so no one will be able to see your skin through the crochet. You will show a bit of side boob ."
4.0,fitted
4.0,Good but the material is cheap but still pretty.
4.0,I love this purse. The leather is soft and rich looking.. I wanted a larger size wristlet that would fit my glasses.  The only downside to it is that is a little heavy for a wristlet without anything in it. It really is cute and works well for me.
4.0,El artículo es lo que esperaba bonito y cómodo y sobre todo abriga
4.0,Seems to be high quality.  The material is very thick so you will not have to worry about getting cold.  I haven't had the chance to actually wear the dress out yet.  I have tried it on and my initial thought was that I like the dress.  I am hoping that my opinion stays the same after I actually wear it out.
4.0,"The one I purchased fits my 44mm Apple Watch.  The colors are subtle - a mixture of colors to resemble a rainbow, but more pinkish in tone.<br />This is not magnetic - it uses a clasp.  It does come with a little screwdriver to make adjustments.<br />I gave it a four because I would like to the color of the band to be more vibrant, like the picture.<br />I’m also not a fan of the clasp - I would rather have a magnetic band. However, with that said, the clasp will be more secure.<br />These are durable and long lasting, so you will have made a sound purchase."
4.0,I wear a 10.5 shoe but buy an 11 in a sandal.  I ordered and 11 and it was almost 1/2 inch shorter than an 11  size shoe is supposed to be.  I had to return and order a size 12.
4.0,"I hope they liked this , it was a gift."
4.0,Ide love to give this 5 stars because its such a cute swimsuit but the top was see through if the shells on the front were attached all the way i wouldnt have had an issue with it! BUT Its an easy fix! My 5 year old loves it! We got it for her 6th birthday party!
4.0,"Had to get a new strap for my watch. This one is pretty solid. The &#34;quick release&#34; feature is a different string pin, one which has a lever attached so you can pull back the pin, releasing the band, by moving the lever. That feature will make band replacement easier next time, but one hopes that will be five or more years from now. The band is still stiff, but it looks good."
4.0,Very light weight nice for fall
4.0,They were a little too big for what I wanted
4.0,Was actually a LITTLE big on me so the bow in the back is perfect.  Length (I'm 5'4 and ordered the small) was slightly longer than expected.  Closer to mid calf than knee as shown in the picture
4.0,"Great price, cool design, and in style."
4.0,"My only complaint is when you look at the blue top featured here, the top clearly meets the pants and does not expose the belly. The actual top is cropped much shorter and will leave the belly exposed. Not exactly the most useful thing in winter clothing. Other than that, the top is soft, fuzzy, and the colors are very nice. It is a bit on the thin side, but I expected that. With regular washings, it should last you a season or two."
4.0,They fit a little bigger on my face than I like my sunglasses to fit.<br />Overall they’re pretty decent 😊
4.0,"Super cute, fits great. Only problem, they're a little heavy and slip down. Other than that I love the design and look!"
4.0,"Dress is cute, but the color is not as intense as in the picture."
4.0,"I'm 5'7"" 125lbs 30FF and ordered the medium. Initially I didn't think this would be supportive at all because this top reminds me a lot more of a cami instead of a sports top. It's soft and comfortable, lightweight. It actually does provide a light amount of support that works fine for weight lifting/stretching/lounging. It's also not too cropped or low cut on me which is great! I think it's a little higher priced than other tops I've tried in similar styles, so I removed a star for that reason."
4.0,"My sister has larger arms so they tended to roll down a bit, but otherwise great"
4.0,"I love this top! Initially, i was disappointed to discover the fabric is fairly light weight. However, I quickly got over that. The larger/plus sizing is accurate. I like everything about it and plan to buy other Jess & Jane items."
4.0,"The seller sent me a jacket that was 2x larger than the size I ordered but I decided to keep the larger size to have extra room to bundle up. Although the jacket was big, it was very comfortable and I had so many compliments!"
4.0,"Nice quality. But order 2 sizes larger than you would normally order. For the price, the shirt was worth the extended wait on arrival."
4.0,"These started out great, but after you wear them the filter comes out of the pouch and pops up into you vision.  I corrected this by folding over the top towards my face covering the filter to keep it in place.  I also added a small piece of Velcro to hold the fabric over the filter area.  Now they work great again.  I like the ear cut outs, it holds the mask up over your face.  I would recommend with these corrections you will like it as you don't need to keep track of a mask."
4.0,"Very comfortable fits perfectly ,however the pants legs are a little long"
4.0,"The pant are soft, very comfy but a little transparent."
4.0,"Super cute wore it to a wedding.<br />The dress was very form fitting, so you see everything."
4.0,This is a beautiful dress. It is made of a heavy satin that hangs very nicely. We did take it in to a seamstress to have the straps and fabric on the front by the armpits taken in slightly so the straps would stay on her shoulders. And once we tightened the ribbons in the back we tucked them in instead of tying them and letting them hang on the outside of the dress. My daughter's favorite part was that this dress actually has pockets which was nice for prom to be able to keep her phone in it.
4.0,Very cute shirt. Nice material. It is a bit clingy when you buy your true size but it’s still a nice fit. I’ll probably buy this in multiple colors.
4.0,"I gave this to my boyfriend and he loves it and it seems to be comfortable.  I  haven't heard anything negative at all.  We just got it about a week ago, so I can't attest to how well it stands up to wear & tear from washing & wearing.  Hopefully well!  Super funny picture!"
4.0,Does not fit my newly 7 year old. Much too small both ways. Probably best for 2-5 year olds. It is very soft though.
4.0,really nice shirt. looks more comfortable in the picture than in real life.
4.0,"I like the dress.  The color is not a true black but aside from that, I plan to keep it.  The arms are a little snug in relation to how loose the rest of the garment is.  It will be an easy piece to wear.  I can dress it up with a scarf and leggings or dress it down."
4.0,"It’s not the best, but definitely a great item for the price. Would buy again."
4.0,Helped a lot during the last New England winter
4.0,"Doesn't look as good on me as I had hoped, but still a very comfortable piece of clothing."
4.0,Delivered as promised. Didn't really care for the material but it was a nice graphic and recipient really liked it.
4.0,"They actually stay on and very comfortable compare to many other “no-show” socks out there. But they are not completely no-show and they were a bit too lose for my 7.5 size feet. I’d give 5 stars if they were a tad smaller and lower. It didn’t give me an option for 4 & half hence, 4 stars but it’s more like 4 & half."
4.0,"Nice, simple dress. I found that this tends to run a bit small, at least it seems to be the case. I opted for a 12 and am normally a 10. It was still snug. Luckily the fabric has some give as it is a bit on the thin and stretchy side. But not so thin that it feels awkward to wear. It is comfortable.<br /><br />The dress appears to be designed well with a style that could probably flatter most body types and easily be dressed up (or down). The criss crossing design did hang a tad loose which seemed odd, but I am not very 'top' heavy so maybe this was just the result of my shape.<br /><br />Care was easy. Threw in the wash on delicate and hung to dry.<br /><br />I would consider picking this style up in a few colours."
4.0,Thick enough material that you don't see through it.
4.0,"Not the best picture but even though this dress is gorgeous, I felt so uncomfortable in it because I kept worrying that a nipple was popping out. I'm 5'5"", 150 lbs and a 34DD. I think it would've fit an A or B cup for sure. Maybe a C cup at most."
4.0,"I needed this for a black and white party and it fit the bill. No, the dress is not the best quality but it's super cute for the price. I wear 16-18 in dresses and the xxl fit me perfectly. It would not have worked if I were larger than a C cup though."
4.0,"A nice, ""crushed velvet"" cloak that fits well. I'm 5'9"" and 160lbs and it drapes quite nicely from my head down below my feet. It'd be perfect as an addition for a vampire costume, or even some sort of wizard."
4.0,Quality product got the price. Fit well in both my helmets. I'll probably pick a pair up for overcast days and night riding with clear lenses. The smoked out lenses worked really well in bright situations. Didn't experience much fogging.
4.0,Very cute. Fits as expected I would say but since I am a little busty it hugs my boobs but still looks super cute. I got lots of compliments at work.
4.0,"serves the purpose, cute, adorable and my daughter can use it for winter or part of an outfit !!! !!~!"
4.0,"Nice dress IF you are young, or if you've got a shrug to wear over it."
4.0,"These are very nice and lightweight sunglasses. I purchased these for my mom but there was no way to stretch out the ear wires, which were too tight, and so we returned them."
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture. My only issue is that it doesn't lay flat on my chest. That may be because it was folded in a bag. I still love it though.
4.0,decent item.  Fast delivery.  Would have liked different sizes.
4.0,"Although this fits me, the flair at the bottom would be better if it is a bit wider as shown in photo. Perhaps my hip is not in the right proportion. :) Definitely can't take wider steps walk."
4.0,Not quite as soft as previous hoodies from Russell
4.0,"After reading lots of the reviews I ordered half a size up. So glad I did. They are comfy and beautifully made, but tight across the toe s on the right foot."
4.0,"I recently ordered these flower headbands at a discounted price for my honest review. I received my package quickly. I received 8 headbands that were all beautiful colors. I feel that I will be able to use these headbands with many outfits. When I received the headbands I thoroughly looked at all of them. Several of the headbands had strings of glue hanging from them. It was easy to remove and I did not feel that it was a problem. These headbands we're still structurally sound. One of the headbands did have the stitching visible through the flower. I was impressed with these headbands because they fit my two month old girl all the way up to my 8 year old girl. They also fit two other girls in between those ages as well. The headbands seemed to fall out of their hair a lot, however I have very active children :-). I will love using these headbands for family photos. Overall I would highly suggest these headbands for your little ladies in your life."
4.0,"Made my Halloween costume out of this. It was a bit larger than I had hoped (legs are spread in pic to reduce bagginess), but was very comfortable and had no problems staying up (even with the heavy extras I added). Thinner material, so you may need to plan ahead on undergarments if leaving white. I painted mine, so wasn’t an issue. Good quality for the price!"
4.0,Dress was just as expected.  Very nice and have received many compliments!
4.0,My Smoky quartz necklace came fast. I really like this necklace. Wear it alot. Thanks!
4.0,My sister loves it. I noticed she struggles to put  it on due to her arthritis.
4.0,I like that the elastic doesn't hurt around the ears.
4.0,"Very nice top, got compliments. Beware, wash twice by hand because the black color runs."
4.0,"Very nice jeans, loved the color. Only gave a 4 star because they are certainly fitted. Comfortable enough though, they stretch some, looked flattering."
4.0,Very pretty bras but a little big and I'm a 34 DDD. I can't wear them for support but they are perfect to sleep in.
4.0,Quality flip flop. Hard to take off sometimes. Main complaint is they stick to sole of foot if you’re used to casually putting on flops and taking off don’t buy these. Otherwise great support flop.
4.0,We decided to keep these masks but the description says they are made out of cotton.  The bag they come in says they are  80% polyester and 20% non-woven. They are ok if you have a small face. Don't buy these if you have a large face. The loops around the ears are adjustable. There is some soft metal sewn in the mask that runs along the bridge of the nose which is nice. Ultimately we decided to keep these and try them out.  I gave it four stars because of the confusion over the material of construction.
4.0,"The necklace is super cute, but the chain was a bit longer than I anticipated. However, it was an easy fix and now it's perfect!"
4.0,The band looks just like the picture and was easy to put on the watch.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is because the under side and leather loop are bright white. The bottom of the excess band is really obvious and the white loop detracts from the beautul color and pattern on the band. Luckily I had a loop from a navy band that I am using instead.  Dying the inside and loop in a coordinating color that matchrs the band would be a huge improvement
4.0,I love the color & the material looks good 😊
4.0,"Item arrived promptly in a plastic bag pushed into my mailbox.  I had to steam the wrinkles out due to it having been in a bag during shipment.<br />Otherwise it seems quite elegant.<br />I have a very low functioning left hand and have not tied my own tie since 1993.  Every time an occasion arrives where I need to wear a tie I am desperate for a solution.  Finally I discovered the zipper tie!  Why has no occupational therapist told me of these....<br />I will be wearing it in 2 days.<br /><br />The instructions included say:<br />1. Open:  One hand holding the center of loop other hand knot.<br />2. Pull knot down slowly to widen loop.  Place loop over head and adjust collar.<br />3. Close:  One hand holding the tail of zipper, other hand holding knot firmly and pull it to collar, Adjust for comfortable fit.<br /><br />I put loop over a doorknob to then pull knot to widen loop  Only enough to go over head, so there will not be too much  of step 3 to pull to collar.<br />Once on, I managed to pull knot to collar.<br />I will be buying more of these"
4.0,"In the pictures it looked so dainty but in person it was kind of big and fake looking. Still very cute,just not quite what I was looking for."
4.0,"The only issue I have is with the description. The band length is described as ""men's standard"", what the heck is that? It was a little too big as expected, I would have ordered some replacement bands as well if I knew what to get. Otherwise, not a bad snag."
4.0,I love the rings they are great. The only suggestion I would make to a new buyer is maybe go up a size it was a little tight at first but i stretched mine with a water bottle top to help it loosen up. Definitely thinking about buying more colors!
4.0,Quality of hat is fine. I'm not certain why I thought this was a structured hat (which is what I prefer).  I'm chain that up to put research on my part.
4.0,"Great, cute, inexpensive bathing suit. Top fit well for me and was very comfortable, I would totally wear it (I did wear it) as a bra once it was dry. But the bottom band was tight around my thigh/butt. Not sure it is supposed to be like that or I have bigger thighs? On my vacation I ended up wearing this top and other bottoms I had most of the time. I just mix matched between the two sets I had. But these were my least favorite bottoms. Overall great suit, it isn’t too thin or anything. I would recommend."
4.0,works for what is for.  They do smell funny but its not like is go around sniffing my shoes all the time.
4.0,"Finally figured out sizing on this. I'm 5'4,122 lbs & usually a medium but a large was necessary. Material is sturdy, never put in dryer, has held up well. I love the angled drape and have it in 6 colors"
4.0,This bow is actually smaller than regular boy bows. It's very beautiful and came quickly.
4.0,Very good product. Timely shipping.<br />However a little pricy
4.0,It looks nice but came without any instructions. I had to find similar styles and look at photos to figure it out myself. My daughter is happy with it overall.
4.0,These cushions fit very well in my shoes and provide an extra level of comfort for my feet.
4.0,"This is a beautiful top and fits rather flattering. I love the little details on the sleeves, I love how it is comfortable to wear, so I love to wear it to school and I do not feel overdressed or uncomfortable. I love how I can pair it with leggings, a skirt, or something more professional. I think the price point is a little to high, but I do like the top."
4.0,Very portable and so far functional. The automatic closing function is a little slow and sticks a bit but for the price point that is mostly a minor issue.
4.0,"Nice, light summer lounge pants. Good for summer and spring."
4.0,"They are so cute, but it did turn copper within a week of wearing. ( I usually coat jewelry in clear nail polish, but it's been a while since I've had belly rings, so I forgot.)"
4.0,Fit a little tight but I love the colors.  The true red is great.  Only wish hardware was silver vice gold.  But a full leather shoe.  Love it.
4.0,rubs the toes a bit but otherwise great.
4.0,"Its solid, and I love what it represents. I didnt read the details super well so Im not sure if it said silver plated or not? The back of the celtic pendant has turned a blackish color. Ive worn it in the shower so maybe it tarnished or just the front was silver plated. It was $25 and Im pretty happy."
4.0,"Nice eyeglass retainers.  They fit thin or wide temples.  I have only had them a short time, but they appear to be well made."
4.0,LOVE THE DRESS
4.0,"This sweatshirt is very soft, comfortable and warm.  The sweatshirt runs a little small."
4.0,Disliked no directions for zipping on plastic. I almost sent it back. The zipper is zipped on backwards. It take me 5 minutes to figure that out.
4.0,Love the dress but didn’t get any earrings
4.0,"One of the rings was missing, may have been lost in shipment. Other then that they are awesome! Discomfort is to be expected as it is you sticking things up your nose."
4.0,"Good Quality, exactly what I ordered."
4.0,"Arrived quickly, nice tone on the heather grey. Makes you want to spin around and walk on windy days- lol<br />The sizing is a little strange. The waist is a little snug ( I’m a size 10/12) and I got the longest length ( I’m 5,7) it brushes the floor in flats but sits perfectly in heals. I do wish the waist was a little larger ( seems to be one size) I would have ordered a slightly shorter one as well because I’m normally in flats. But I’m keeping because I’m not sure if it will shrink when I hand wash it."
4.0,These are really soft a cool looking. Sizing is a bit off. I wear an 8.5  and the M is a bit loose.
4.0,"As noted in other reviews, waist is higher than you might guess from the picture. Also, it's CRAZY long. I'm 5'6&#34; with a slender frame, and even with my tallest heels I'll have to hem it. But, good fabric and well constructed."
4.0,"So let me start by saying visually the front of the mask is gorgeous! Its sparkly, blingy and so so girly.  I love it.<br /><br />My reason for 4 stars only is that the "" ear loop adjuster"" is this cheap rubbery spring looking this and its hard to adjust.<br /><br />Straight out of the bad, the mask smells chemically, so definatly wash it first. The straps are a bit rough feeling behind my ear.<br /><br />The ""filter"" is this cheap toilet paper looking thing. Reminds me of those under eye guards they put before doing lash extensions. Frankly my cats litter filter is thicker then what was in the mask. Throwing it away solves the issue.<br /><br />Will I buy it again? Yes and in different colors too. Why? because its blingy and pretty. Simply for that reason."
4.0,"If you are tall or busty, waist is a little high."
4.0,"This dress is really pretty and comfortable, but had to be taken in under my arms for whatever reason is was loose there.  It is a bit stretchy and I was comfortable wearing it to a wedding.  Sequins are sparkly, but refined and not over the top."
4.0,Cute. Nice gift. Has sharp angles and points but that is dies to 3D shape but it’s still cute
4.0,"I know these are house shoes and they're not meant to""support"" but it didn't take very long for the spot where the heel rests to wear down flat. Just a little extra in that area would be perfect!"
4.0,"Very thin and seem flimsy but they hold up well. Colors are more transparent than they seem. Overall, like the product; comes in a nice velvet bag."
4.0,Love it. . . Thanks. . .
4.0,They fit a woman’s face and fog up a bit but like these better than others I’ve had.
4.0,Love this necklace. Good weight to it. It's lovely.
4.0,"used it daily since I rcvd it.<br />works well...very slim, adequate storage.<br />No way to test the RFID block, tho...just have to trust it I guess"
4.0,"I bought this for Christmas, and I generally like this brand a lot, but I haven't even seen it yet. Just tired of being harassed for a review."
4.0,I adore these!!!  They are a little large but I was so happy with the value I didn’t look at all the photos before purchase. But I am completely happy with their size.
4.0,great looking tie clip and at a awesome price.  I have used it for months and still operates and finish is strong
4.0,my little girl loved it really nice quality...
4.0,Muy cómodos y la tela súper buena
4.0,Very pretty dress however it was a bit too small. Also I didn't care for the side slits  They went up too far on my leg.
4.0,"This was a birthday gift for my daughter. She loves it. The picture doesn't do it justice, very pretty ring."
4.0,"It's a cut set. Fabric is ""meh"" Fits perfectly, nice and loose."
4.0,"This product fits as expected, it's very comfy and flattering. It is more fitted at the top and flows down nicely and less fitted around the stomach. It looks great with dark Jean's or black leggings and booties. It's not particularly warm, but with a light cami under and a jacket I was warm enough outside for a few hours. You'll be fine indoors wearing it, just wanted to point out it's not a sweater thick shirt."
4.0,The top fits a little loose for someone of my size. I am 5'3&#34; and 125 pounds. I would recommend definitely a small for someone of my size. The bottoms of course are adjustable so those are easy to fit.
4.0,It was loose but shrank to fit tight
4.0,"These are light weight, look good. They are polarized so be prepared for that when you look at your phone with your shades on.  They were a good price, come with a bag. I don’t love them design wise."
4.0,My daughter loves these shoes. Unfortunately she has eczema and a latex allergy. These triggered an eczema flare up and made her skin horrible. I wish she could've worn them. They are made well and comparable to crocs.
4.0,The fit it true to size
4.0,Looking forward to fall and being able to wear them!
4.0,"Good length. It is slightly smaller than expected. The sleeves are bigger than expected. It is not a bad dress, but if it is going to be worn in the office I don't want it to be that tight with statement sleeves. I think it was cute....just not for me."
4.0,Nice. But smaller than I thought
4.0,"grand-kids love them, we like that they are 14k gold and great price. they look like real diamonds"
4.0,its cheap and basic but it works well
4.0,Dress was smaller than preferred. Had to return.
4.0,I haven’t actually worn it to garden yet but fully tried it on when I received it and the brim is large enough to cover me well. I might actually turn the brim up to see or slide the hat back on my head. I like it
4.0,These work very nicely while you cook.  They serve the purpose.
4.0,Good qulity leather. Good price
4.0,These are super cute. Kind of big when we first opened them but since washed they shrank a good amount so should be fine.
4.0,"Very thin and seethrough material. They feel like tights, not socks. I'm 5'5&#34; and 130 lbs, they're small for me. A little overpriced, in my opinion, but it's prime."
4.0,"It's very thin material. Doesn't really feel like it is waterproof, in a good rain I feel like it seeps through the material a bit, making my skin feel slightly damp. But it keeps my clothes dry for the most part. It's good for storing because it's very compactible, so it's handy to have in case you have rain unexpectedly. I keep in my car for this reason."
4.0,Like the quality of the sweatshirt...very soft and comfortable...runs a little large.
4.0,"I bought 3 of these tops; black, white, and burgundy. I bought all 3 in a large and all 3 fit the same. The material is light and flowy and kind of silky feeling. The length in the back is great but they are a bit shorter than I would like in the front, they hit just below my belly button. They are pretty comfortable but they are somewhat tight in the chest. I'm 5'8, 160-165lbs, and wear a 36C bra. I wore the burgundy top with a tighter fitting bralette and it was tight. If my chest was the slightest bit bigger it might be pretty uncomfortable lol."
4.0,"The navy shirt had shiny fabric for the flowered part.  I didn't like the feel/look of that, but the other colors are a cottony blend which is much better."
4.0,they look so real and so bright. great choice
4.0,"A little snug, I was able to stretch it a bit with a kitchen pot."
4.0,"Really beautiful and the boyfriend adores, but I really should've gotten the small (xs). I'm a 30B and 108lbs, 5'6&#34;. It isn't terribly big, and doesn't fall off by any means, it's just a person preference :). For the price, I cannot complain. Really sexy, light weight material."
4.0,"Its cute. I bought it obviously because of the skulls and the color scheme. Mine came just the way its pictured and its cheap but boy is it heavy. I'm not sure what the skulls are made of but it does have some weight to it.<br /><br />I purchased an anklet at my local Walmart that actually has the same skulls on it and matched up just fine. Oh, I also have super tiny wrists and this fit me good. Not too big but not small just right with out it wanting to fly off of my arm when moving around."
4.0,"It's easy to wear..I would of liked the fabric a bit heavier..if you have a mole on your back, you will see it through the fabric. It's not like you can see through the fabric, it's just a lite weight material. It has Lycra in it, so it is stretchy. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
4.0,"Really pretty and well constructed. I ordered a few Kurtis from this company<br />and they are all very nice but also *very sheer*. One thing I was happy about, the<br />fabric was vibrant and did not smell of heavy chemicals."
4.0,"Impressed with the look, feel and quality.  A little tight above the elbow, but workable.  Perfect for the performance for which I needed them.  Thanks!"
4.0,fabric rather thin but for the price its great
4.0,fits good. not too hot in miami
4.0,"I like this bag as a whole, a little small for my personal taste. I do think the shorter strap could be 3&#34; longer and the opening to the bag should be wider, at least as wide as the bottom of the bag, its just hard to get my wallet in the small opening. I will keep this bag but I did order another larger Heshe bag in navy. This bag is nicely made, its just hard for me to find the perfect bag, I love a hobo bag but it needs to be large enough for all the things I think I need to carry everyday and small enough so you won't put too much in it. Love all the great pockets inside the bag. Its a great bag for someone that doesn't carry a lot."
4.0,"I'm glad I read other reviews stating these leotards run small.  I bought the M (8-10) for my petite daughter who just turned 6.  It fits her perfectly.  That said, the quality is great."
4.0,It's okay. The paint does not match the photo.<br /><br />I did receive a small discount in consideration of my review.
4.0,"Looks great wrapped around my head.  They are lined with fleece which I didn't know was a wicking material, but after a few uses at the gym, they definitely keep the sweat out of my eyes.  Stitching started to come out on one of them where the velcro attaches, but a simple sewing fix.  Would give it 5 stars if these were made with a better wicking material and better stitching."
4.0,"i like that they are colorful, great for ""rock your socks day"" good support, they are not a real thin sock so they hold up nicely.  the first couple times wearing them they did cut into my leg some (but i don't have skinny legs) it wasn't real bad, but after a couple washings they were really comfortable. they hold their elasticity for quite some time, i have ordered before and plan on ordering again.. good value in this product"
4.0,Vivid colors; good construction
4.0,We got this set to complete our goth outfit!<br />My daughter loved!!
4.0,Very cute dress.  It was very dressy.  Fit great.  It was pretty long in the back though and since I'm only 5'2&#34; it dragged even with heels.
4.0,Very. Nice
4.0,Very happy with t 👕
4.0,"this is a gift, but they look good"
4.0,Just needed to be sent to the cleaners because it came a bit wrinkly. Overall beautiful and received many compliments!
4.0,"I bought these because I have to wear at least sterling silver earrings because I have allergic reactions to everything else. Like others said they are a little long and poke my head when I sleep. They aren't very shiny, but I wasn't expecting too much for the price.<br /><br />All in all, they look fine for day-to-day  wear. They are not good enough for dressy occassions."
4.0,Wore it to Diner en blanc
4.0,"The garter is too tight! It’s not comfy to wear when in bed! Again, it is not true to size."
4.0,"It is beautiful. Just too dainty for me. It would be great for a small delicate pendant. I wear it all by itself and it adds a pretty touch. It is dainty, but not weak. It has held up to me, so that means it may be dainty, but it's a tough bugger."
4.0,It’s a thinner material then I thought it was going to be almost feels like pajamas also is wider then I figured it would be
4.0,"This dress fit excellent and felt amazing on my skin. I received so many compliments while wearing this dress. The dress was NOT constricting and I felt sexy. The only problem is how the tags are attached to the side of the dress. When I cut the tag, a hole formed on the dress."
4.0,It was a gift and she loved it....
4.0,"Works well, though the straps to attach aren’t the greatest and can slide off of glasses with smooth ear pieces"
4.0,"It's really a great top, plenty of room around the shoulders with flaring sleeves. My only problem is that it is snug around the stomach and hips."
4.0,"I thought the quality of this purse is excellent. I should have paid more attention to the shipping time it took, but I am very happy with this purchase."
4.0,"I LOVE these dresses, I LOVE my grand daughter can dress up AND it is cotton, not a cheap polyester dress making her hot etc.... PLEASE be aware these run SUPER small... my 2.5 yr old grand daughter is 43 pounds, and we bought 6x-7, and it will IFT today, but is she sneezes it will be too small.. they are great quality, and loved by her... she would never let me return it for larger, but go up one maybe even 2 sizes"
4.0,Bought as a gift. She loved them
4.0,"So I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them. Says they are super comfortable. The reason I give them 4 out of 5 is because the straps that go over your feet are really spacious. Now, this works for my boyfriend because he has bad feet and the extra room is fine for him, he can't have them too fitted, but just a thought if you like them to fit properly, you may not like these. I was worried they would fly off his feet because they look so loose but it hasn't happened yet. Other than that, well made and a nice little arch support."
4.0,The shirt length is short. It could have been longer. Also the material is a little thin. Otherwise it looks great.
4.0,"Washed nicely, minimal shrinkage."
4.0,Plastic nice and thick wish it was bigger
4.0,"I am upgrading my review aa this is my 3rd year with this hat... one size does not fit all - i would go as far as to say does not fit most. I have a 7 1/8 hat size and this is not a good fit, but Its good enough.. the speaker in the left ear moves about - so you have to get it situated once you fit the hat on your head. The controls may not line exactly up with the buttons, so you may have to slid and fidget with it a bit. Sound quality is actually pretty good, better when the hat presses against your ear. Not bad for the price . it is kind of awkward, but once you get the hat on and speakers moved and controls lined up - it pretty much stays in place. I have used this while skiing and it is good for 5 hours..I  bought 2 for just under $20 each ."
4.0,"I bought this for a friend and unfortunately, she complained about the size to be a tad too large. The overall quality of the product is fantastic though."
4.0,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it but its pretty small. Doesn't fit like a dress. Had I known I would've got 2 sizes up so that it would fit like a dress.
4.0,"I like it . it was just longer than I thought it would be .. depends on the picture you look at . The design is  imprinted , not part of the fabric .  But its an ok dress. design is only in front .  good for the price if you need  work clothes."
4.0,"If you have long or regular arms, don’t buy"
4.0,Dress was too short for my taste
4.0,A bit snug but the size up would have been too big.  Gorgeous gown for the price.
4.0,Plenty of space for credit cards.  Nice lightweight wallet.  Good size
4.0,"Bought this watch from Amazon, received it very quickly.  The watch is very well put together.  It looks great, the digital display is slightly muted and as such it give the watch an overall clean look.  Unfortunately, you can't turn off the digital display completely.<br /><br />The buttons worked well.  They are easy to operate, but no audible feedback.<br /><br />The manual definitely needs work.<br /><br />According to the manual, battery life is about 3 years.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with the watch."
4.0,"Sleeves are kinda big, The outfit is stretchy....order a lg but overall me and my boo loved it. 🥰"
4.0,"These were cute and what I was looking for, for our Christmas party. Our girls 4 and 10 loved them! They are cheaply made but they worked and that’s all that matters. The lights flash for 5-6 hours, long enough for our needs. I think as long as you know what you’re getting with these, you won’t be disappointed."
4.0,Very helpful to cover my head in cold weather.  Other stocking hats let too much air in and thus cold air.<br />Good purchase.  Can be warn under another hat as an additional layer.
4.0,I purchase as a present for Christmas. They have not been used yet. I will update when they are.
4.0,Pretty but irritates finger after a long wear
4.0,Need to buy a size bigger but I really like them !
4.0,It's a great late Spring through early Fall rain coat.
4.0,"These jeans are cut-off at the bottom.  But they are sewn right above, so hopefully they will not fray too much more. They have a 27.5” inseam.  They are made of 99% cotton and 1% spandex.  They have a slight bit of stretch, but not a lot.  They have a “typical” denim feel, so not that soft, but not really rough either.  Note the vertical lines of dark and light blue.  They have two front pockets.  .. two back pockets. . . a metal zipper with button at the top.  The belt loops are 2.25”.  These jeans are Made in Vietnam."
4.0,"Very cute, fits really nice!"
4.0,"For the price, these are attractive moccasins/slippers with cozy plush lining. They do run extremely wide; you can<br />undo and tighten the cord lacing, but for a narrow to medium foot, they are still quite wide. As shoes to wear around the house, with leggings, jeans  or loungewear, they are nice; they have a rubberized sole, and you could briefly wear them outside if need be. Doubtful that they will hold up in the long run, and they also shed a bit, but again, for the low price, they are warm and comfortable. They arrive well-packaged in a cloth shoe bag wrapped in a plastic bag. The inner labels of the shoes say that they are machine washable, but doubtful that they would hold up well from being put through a washing machine/dryer, as they don't seem that sturdy."
4.0,"I wear a size 12 jeans and ordered XL. The fit is pretty loose, a L would have been perfect. They're soft, stretchy... a little on the thin side but perfect for lounging around the house or sleeping. Which is what I got them for"
4.0,"Looks more expensive than it was, would've gotten 5 stars but it isn't flexible."
4.0,Good quality for the price. Great for a new knee replacement patient.
4.0,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my daughter and signed her up for BJJ. This did not come with a belt, so when she opened it, she was excited until she tried it on and found no belt. I had to order one which is no big deal. I probably didn't look hard enough to see if it came with a belt. Maybe they should have that somewhere in bold letters."
4.0,Hard to tell if they are gray or tan
4.0,"The material of these pants are pretty. You can't see through them even when doing squats. They are flattering to the body all around. I gave it a 4 because they seem to shrink when you wash them. I bought a size S and I weigh 135, height 5 feet 1 inch"
4.0,"Great shirt, i'm a man of 190lbs and 1.8 mts height, i bought an XL because of the reviews, but it was a bit large, then i bought a L size white one, and fitted perfectly, i can't wait for the blue shirt to be available again in L to purchase another one... fully recommend them!"
4.0,"So all the reviews said these ran small,  and they aren't lying.  I wear a 9.5 regularly,  so i got the large size,  and the first time wearing these i almost thought about sending them back because the back part felt uncomfortable on my heel. But after a second wear,  they have conformed more to my feet and feel so comfy and I'm so glad i kept them! Nice thick sole so i can step out on our patio and not worry about getting a hole in the bottom.  Solid flip flop slipper."
4.0,A little snug but otherwise love it
4.0,I received the White long sleeve and it was not ribbed.
4.0,"Great visor but it's white, not beige"
4.0,Very nice bracelet for the price! It has good weight and size and feels good on the wrist.
4.0,Do not put it in the dryer. 😁
4.0,Just received my earrings and I love them. They are lite weight. I try them on briefly they look great!
4.0,I followed the size chart and the belt does fit but it causes a weird under squish right below where the belt ends like it’s a little too tight
4.0,"I bought these for my 8 year old son & he loved them. Until he wore them for a little while in the house. The boots are a higher than normal high top. They rubbed on his legs, through socks, and made them raw & sore. He had them on in the house for less than an hour. I can't say if it's something that would go away or that he would get used to bcuz he wouldn't wear them so I returned them."
4.0,"Either it was error or it was done on purpose, but they say, ""I just wanna hany with my dog"".  I don't think anyone would really be able to easily read anything from just looking at them from a reasonable distance except for the word, ""dog"".  ""Hany"" - really.  The socks though, are soft, stretchy very colorful and light weight.  The colors and designs are really pretty and my teens love them.  I think they're well made and should last for a while."
4.0,Le<br />Falta un poco más de firmesa
4.0,Love the dress! Got lots of compliments
4.0,Elegant looking and appropriate dress for a wedding party . Sleeves a little tight on the arms.
4.0,Content
4.0,love this item.
4.0,These fit just right and fold nicely over the top of the joules boot!
4.0,Good quality for the price. Fit much better than expected. The only complaint I have is that you have to thread the laces yourself and I am not a huge fan of the sparkly black lace they used. Otherwise great!
4.0,"Does the job, but feels uncomfortable"
4.0,Beatific scarf
4.0,"This petticoat was very nice quality, however it was on the small size."
4.0,"Feels good on the wrist even without a wetsuit on. Only complaint is strap is to short for my liking, I dive in cold water with a 8/7 wetsuit and it’s on the last hole. Wish they made it a inch longer. If you have big wrists and dive with a wetsuit I don’t think this product is for you. As noted from a previous review the new strap insets are plastic, hope they hold to the test of lobster season. I with tethering this to me for the first few dives to make sure!"
4.0,"Very cool jacket, for those looking for an 80s retro feel to it. I dig the flattering cut, angular edges, and the dramatic contrast with the larger than life buckles/zippers is terrific. Definitely a fun jacket for fun activities.<br /><br />Note, however, this runs small and petite. It fit my wife wonderfully, who happens to be tiny at 5'2'' and around 120 pounds. I would definitely order a size up (minimum) if you're an above/average body type.<br /><br />Finally, build quality is decent but not great. You're paying for fashion, but not durability. Definitely an occasional versus every day jacket."
4.0,I ordered this top because i had ordered a similar top just like it.  I love the feel of the material and the loose fit around my belly area but the tighter fit around my hips.  It is dressy enough to put on with a nice skirt and casual enough to wear with jeans.  I plan to order more.
4.0,"Stylish and they don't seem like they were made out of cheap plastic. Only 4 stars because one of the screws on the arm is not set properly in place, but does not effect the glasses. These are very comfortable and I do recommend these if you like this style."
4.0,"Very nice looking, hasn't performed any miracles yet though !!! lol !"
4.0,"If you're a curvy girl and want these shorts, you'd will probably need to go up a few sizes to get that relaxed feel from what one would think of as basketball shorts. I'm 5'2"", 160lbs, got a medium and there was very little give. The were definitely long enough but tight across the butt and thighs."
4.0,I think it’s cute and like the style. Washed it one time and pockets seem kinda stretched out. We will see how it holds up but so far so good. Well worth the money.
4.0,"Yes, they didn't fit me. I usually wear a 39 and ordered a 39.  They fit my daughter that is a size 8 and I am an 8.5 so I am going to order the 40's.  They are super cute and she says they are comfortable."
4.0,My only complaints are that it’s really thin material and my cat is a nugget and doesn’t want to stay in the pouch.
4.0,"Fits well and feels so cottony. After one was, color faded a bit but still functions."
4.0,"they just fit a little odd - the shirt was tight (which i sized up) and the pants were too big.  not sure what pattern they follow, but they will be cute for Christmas day."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d4422b2fb59eef7ca600245d3c210ff0]] Pro’s:<br />- Super cute, and my daughter loves it<br />- good sturdy material<br />- good construction of garment<br /><br />Con’s:<br />- used to thicker and longer ties<br />- Used to double(?) layers... (I’ll try to explain in video.)<br /><br />I have a tradition of buying a child-size Flirty apron for my daughters when they turn 8, and an adult-size when they turn 12.  I have 2 of my own, and have always been happy with the quality. (As you can See from the photo.) This one seems a little less-quality..."
4.0,Pretty brooch and scarf tie but did not come with directions on how to use it with a scarf. Still trying to figure it out.
4.0,"Seem sturdy yet cheap, hopefully that makes sense. If you treat them good I am sure they will last. I think they may be made out of a cheaper material so be mindful of how long you're exposed to chemicals on your products. It comes with a cloth to clean them and a cloth glasses bag for them. Also you can use the cloth bag to clean lenses.<br />If all else fails you at least have a pretty cool hard case for glasses."
4.0,Bought for my mother-in-law; hope she likes it; but you don't know until she sees it and decides for herself.
4.0,Wife is 5'3&#34; with a big rump. They are way too long. If she were taller they'd be hott!
4.0,Nice dress for winter
4.0,Order it your size i made the mistake of ordering a size bigger for the reviews and i regretted it!! The top looks cheap but cute
4.0,I like this bracelet but it seems to slide off or unloosen- the silver portion. I found my constantly adjusting the bracelet often.
4.0,"Great quality, washes well, great price.  However, I ordered a set of 3 large shirts for a Christmas present and received two large and one extra large.  No time to exchange before Christmas Day."
4.0,"I love this top! Tunic is very soft, stretchy, airy & drapes well. It is very flattering, long enough for talls & rear coverage.  There is plenty of volume in the cut & can be worn by any size; even maternity. Fabric is thin, breathable, stretchy & has a fine hand but not see through. Delicate wash, damp dry & hang. Perfect for vacation & travel; easily hand washed & dripped dry. Relaxed fit, full cut U.S. sizing so order actual size. The most comfortable & versatile blouse I've ever owned. Very stylish."
4.0,The Workmanship is Impressive. As it relates to other watches for the same Price!. ( Arrived Earlier then Scheduled )
4.0,Thicker than they look in the picture....brown one is very dark....clasp takes some getting used to but all in all they look good.
4.0,I would give it 5 stars bt the rose is too tiny. You gotta get really close to see whay kinda neckalce it is.
4.0,"This is a very convenient item to have while doing your cleaning around the house, business, etc. Plenty of pockets to put things, you have the wire rings and hoops at the top but this is bulky once you start putting items in it and makes it hard to bend down and such while cleaning. It's still very nice to have. I put my items in the apron for when I'm moving to one room to another and while in one room cleaning I set my items on counter or what have you than pile it all back in apron to go to next room. Priced a little high for this."
4.0,"Nice material, fits well, true to size. The material looks thick and feels nice to touch. The only downside is that the model at the bottom makes it look a lot shorter that it is so you have to factor that in. Not really good for work if there is a conservative environment."
4.0,I only have a four star because the first pair I received one of the earrings was on backwards. They did a quick return and I received the new pair and they are just as beautiful as I thought they would be.
4.0,I haven't wore this item but it is nice.
4.0,"I really love this dress. It's not stretchy, more crisp than I expected, but hangs very nicely and I love wearing it to work. I always get compliments. It washes well.<br /><br />I was between sizes on the chart and since I couldn't decide and others mentioned the arms being strangely snug, I went with the larger size. It's pretty loose. I should've ordered smaller but I'm happy with it and the arms are actually made more snug than I expected so maybe a size down wouldn't have worked so well in the arms. I'm 5'6 and stocky and it hits a little lower than my knee. If it weren't for the arms, I'd say order true to size or if between sizes order down. But those arms are made a little snug with not much give and my arms are not very big. Definitely buy it though!"
4.0,Looks great . Fits true to size . Do not size up
4.0,This is a cute sweater. I only gave it a four because the picture looks like you can wear it as a dress. I was really looking forward to wearing some knee high boots with it. It fits as a normal sweater would.
4.0,Love the look and feel of shirt... I ordered an XL just in case it ran smaller as I normally wear large and I am glad I did. Shirt runs a little smaller.  The xl fits more like smaller large tshirt
4.0,Very pleased with this as it was a gift and my friend loved it.
4.0,"The stretch is a little too good,they were too loose on my kids. They needed to be a little tighter in order to stay up."
4.0,"Really cute item, great for the Corgi lover in your life. Smaller than I expected, but I might have missed the dimensions. These arrived very fast."
4.0,"I want to start out by saying that I like the color selection, these colors are very versatile. they fit over my head good and my curls b/c I have extremely curly and semi thick hair. The only thing I don't like about the headbands is that the edges roll inwards and that gets a bit annoying, but other than that they are awesome."
4.0,A gift for my friend
4.0,"it does the job... very small<br />a bit difficult to hold on a lap, but gets the job done if you are bored on a long trip"
4.0,The bracelet looked pretty and good but after a while the clasp broke. Luckily it was fixable. If you wanted to buy this I would recommend it but be careful with the clasp.
4.0,"Really cute dress, but was too small.  I did exchange it for the next size and the customer service was outstanding."
4.0,It is a little smaller than it needs to be...
4.0,it's comfortable
4.0,"So, this is great fabric, very warm and friendly, but the robe is just bulky.  It is not flattering in appearance at all.  It is very straight, and its bulk does not allow any appearance of a waist line at all, so one looks like a single wad of a person from the knees to the neckline.  I still love it, but would not wear it in front of company or my boyfriend."
4.0,"Si me gusta , solo que me queda largo"
4.0,The crown was for my daughter....It has a nice weight and we both thought it was beautiful.  May have to bend a little to fit her head well but overall very pleased with it.
4.0,Delicate sterling silver dangling earrings well worth the price.
4.0,Nice quality dress for the price. More coverage then a cold shoulder dress.
4.0,"This is a very nice light weight after bath wrap. It has a waffle pattern. The material is thin which is find for me. Its very roomy so its not flying open. I bought the XL even though I wear a medium so that it would wrap around completely which it does.  The elastic and velcro closure is strong. I like it, especially for warmer weather to wear after a shower while I get ready and do my hair."
4.0,The robe itself was not as long are it needed to be for someone that is 76inches tall. Still fits and looks fine but the two drapes that go over your shoulder and the tunic could stand to be a little longer.
4.0,"Very pretty, fits perfectly, but the material is not what I thought it would be. It's more of a slick, athletic-wear kind of material."
4.0,"Good tags, but the item description does not state that you get 2 tags!  Ended up ordering too many!"
4.0,"Great colors, fit is TTS, not as oversized as I would have liked but still looks great. Fabric could be slightly softer, compared to other sweaters from this brand."
4.0,If you want an oversized sweater go up one size
4.0,"I was very happy to find this shirt as my kiddo had outgrown a similar pattern from Carter's that I really loved. The picture makes it look like the center background behind the flowers is white and the sleeves are pink, but they are actually all the same light pink color. It does seem to run a bit small. I ordered the 4T and here it is next to a 3T from Target."
4.0,"The stars aren't the color of blue I thought they looked like in the picture, but still pretty earrings."
4.0,"I purchased this product using the size chart provided in the description.  I ordered a medium based on my measurements and the dress was way too large on the top for me.  Returning, but I don't think the small will be small enough either since it's only a few inches difference on the size chart. It's a pretty dress and seems well made."
4.0,"As picture shows, soft, big on size Large."
4.0,Cute shirt. It shrunk a tiny bit after washing..probably could have used size larger because of that. Love the design.
4.0,"I like everything about this watch, I'll just highlight two negative points. 1) The leather band is not sweat resistant and produces a potent odor when held a few inches from your nose. 2) I somehow got moisture inside the glass face and it was seemingly impossible to get it out, I just had to get used to the condensation inside the watch. Overlooking those two things it is a great watch for the price!"
4.0,They don't leak. But they do fog up.
4.0,"I’d go 5⭐️ if it wasn’t so quick to wrinkle.<br /><br />Love the color and fit, but I was hoping this would be good for travel ... Not sure that’s a good idea."
4.0,I was surprised these fit me since I'm 5'11&#34; with a 33&#34; inseam and have trouble finding leggings that run long enough.
4.0,I didn't pay very close attention to the end of the belt so it didn't have enough holes. It doesn't fit. Not the sellers fault AT ALL
4.0,it tiny..but cute
4.0,"A little tight, but my daughter will wear them for limited amounts of time."
4.0,"Not bad, for the price. Don't expect great, it's only ok."
4.0,"They worked perfectly, eliminating any swelling. However, they are a struggle to get into and the fabric is not as nice as I could wish for."
4.0,Love the material. But both rings did not fit :/
4.0,"These shorts run very small. I am 5’5 145lbs and usually a size 8 fits with tons of room and can be too big. I ordered an 8 and could barely get these buttoned! I do like the shorts though, nice quantity, good for my office job on hot days. So I will be returning and ordering a size up."
4.0,"This corset is gorgeous in person! The attention to detail in the pattern makes it so beautiful. The tie front adds a nice touch of elegance.The ribbon around the top and bottom gives it a soft yet sassy look. I did however have a small problem with the buttons on the front locking in place. You have to make sure that you pull them to lock them in place.<br /> Over all I can wear the corset in confidence, it slims my body and makes me feel good about myself. It is comfortable, isn't too tight or too big. It enhances my bust and slims my stomach. I am able to wear this in the bedroom or pair it with a cute pair of skinny jeans and a pair of sassy heels.<br /><br />If you are looking for a versatile corset that can be worn casually or sexually this is the corset for you.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was sent this item at no cost or at a deep discount in return for me giving my true in biased review."
4.0,"It's too small, but very cute & good quality"
4.0,It was gathering up
4.0,Kinda tight but fits good. 👍🏻
4.0,Well made and really cute.
4.0,"A little bit starchy feeling, but overall, comfy and casual."
4.0,Great set for costume party not high quality but perfect for a costume party
4.0,"These are great, small enough for my granddaughter and so many to choose from.  She loves them."
4.0,Love it for travel. It’s light weight. Wish it had an inside wallet.
4.0,They are a little tight!
4.0,Thought it would be a little more floppy. It's still a nice hat.
4.0,Nice for a minimal style card holder.
4.0,Not the highest quality fabric. You can tell the fabric and the print will fade soon. The fabric is a little stiff so maybe the print coming off a bit might help loose up the shirt. If I knew the fabric was like this I wouldn’t buy it again but I do like the look of the shirt
4.0,A bit too large. Other than that very nice comfy sandals.
4.0,"Very low quality, but gets the job done for a costume!"
4.0,Nice quality. Well made . True to size
4.0,Loved the top of this suit but the bottom didn’t provide as much coverage as I would have liked. Cute design and overall suit!!
4.0,"I really like this bra. I am a 32C and have so far had good experiences wearing this bra. It did stick really well for me, but it is important to apply it to clean skin. No lotion, no oils or I can see it not sticking. I thought the cup size was fine and fit well. It does take a little finesse to get it on evenly. It pulls your boobs together and depending on your body shape and the way you apply it, can give you a little lift, but don't expect this to work like a push up padded miracle bra. You may note the women in the pictures pose with their arms in the air making it look like more lift than the bra actually provides. Also I think the model may have had Breast implants because I know a lot of breasts aren't that perky. Just something to consider to keep your expectations of this bra realistic."
4.0,Loose fit shirt. Fits as expected I wear a large.  Made with a thicker material.
4.0,"I hike every day.<br />These pants are comfortable and good looking, I use them part time as shorts and that works too.<br />They are light, dry fast and feature enough pockets for my needs.<br />They come with a belt integrated in the waistband but also feature loops for a different belt.<br />They won't protect you against insect bites unless you treat them.<br /><br />Being a perfectionist, I always tend to see what I would improve:<br />1 - There is a zipper parallel to the side of the top right front pocket. I thought before buying it that this would be a zippered pocket, but no, it's just a zipper. The ""pocket"" it reveals is so shallow that I wondered whether I'd be able to store a ball point pen in there. Maybe a thin one, but then I couldn't even store a Bic crystal in there as the zipper is too short, and then I wonder how safe it would be: the pen would point right to my belly should I sit against something that would touch the end of the pen...<br />Please think it all the way and make this a zippered pocket.<br />2 - The cursor of the zipper that attaches the legs to the shorts remains attached to the shorts instead of the legs. Not a biggie.<br />3 - Nice touch: the elastic at the bottom of the pants that can be tightened around the ankles. I live in tick country, not far from Lyme, CT, and this is a concern. However since the pants legs are sized to fall nicely as a dress pants, the elastic around the bottom of the leg is pulled up well above the ankle as soon as you sit. Ideally there would be a hem at the fashionable length and inside the leg two or three inches of fabric with the elastic, so that you can tighten the elastic at the ankle level, over the rising hiking shoe.<br />4 - The embedded belt is way too long and ends with a rubber thingy that makes it impossible to slide it in the waistband. I cut it at an angle, finished it with a lighter and can now use it properly.<br /><br />All in all a good pair of hiking pants so far."
4.0,"fits well, and can be worn with alot of different tops"
4.0,Good T-shirt
4.0,Out of all the beads I bought from this seller this is the best one its not really all that great but at least it hasn't turned
4.0,"A lot snugger than I wanted, very fitted. Has spandex in the material so wont stretch. Love the design!!"
4.0,It is so cute. I bought it as a gift I would have preferred it boxed for that reason.
4.0,Ive had it for about a month or two and it has been really good. The pictures really do stand correct.
4.0,Pretty necklace. The only bad thing is it came all tangled up and took me a while to untangle it before I could even see it.
4.0,Love the fabric it's a little short but going to keep it bc its cute
4.0,"These fit my daughter pretty well, a bit on the tight side.  They stayed in place well, and the pockets (one on each leg) were large enough to hold her iphone 7 active without an issue."
4.0,"This little ring is STUNNING. The color is gorgeous – a light rose gold, looks almost like a real band, and could substitute for one when wearing the real one is impractical – grocery store worker, delivery driver, going to the gym.<br /><br />But, the styling is a bit tight, something I wasn't prepared for and thought it would be closer to a ring I have. Both the 14KT gold band and this one are size 7. The gold ring (top) is styled thinner, and the rose gold is thicker. The real gold can easily fit over my thumb, the rose gold doesn’t move past the knuckle. You can see the difference in the ring finger picture with the rose gold on top with the regular gold on the bottom.<br /><br />For the price, this is pretty cool. I wouldn’t hesitate to get it again or a different color."
4.0,"I got a size 12 like a different ring i got a week ago. The other size 12 ring fit perfect, this felt smaller (slightly) than that size 12 so beware"
4.0,My daughter loves these and wears them all the time. They are holding up well after non stop wear and they are comfy
4.0,"I love it, it was a little big at first, I washed it a couple times and now it fits great.  I didn't put it in dryer, just hung to dry.  I love the color and the length to wear with my leggings."
4.0,"This shirt is as amazing and beautiful as it looks in the picture. It fits exactly like it looks, its color is faded ivory with olive coloured leaves and deep rose buds. The only draw back is that the quality of the fabric isn’t so great. The shirt will definitely last the season but probably not much longer. I hope I will find something as great to replace it when this one kicks the bucket."
4.0,"Very pretty but they are too thin, they fall out anytime someone hugs me. Not fun running after my rolling plug. I wear 3/4."
4.0,"Shorter than expected. Still cute, nice fabric for the cost."
4.0,"It is a little smaller in size than I expected, but nicely done.  I'd like one about half again as large."
4.0,"A few pairs broke after a day or two of light use (the pumpkin and spider dangle pairs) as they are made of a felt material and tore wear the charm connects to the earring. Overall, though, I love these for the price and style 😊 I get many compliments when I wear a pair from this set!"
4.0,"Great selections. I've worn two so far since I got them. I had to adjust the neck straps a couple of times. Hooking it up takes a trick. You have to flip up your shirt collar to see what you're doing. Then adjust the straps not to choke yourself, then lower the shirt collar."
4.0,"Recibí lo que pedí : lentes con un buen diseño, de plástico ligero así que no creo que van a durar muchos años, pero por el precio todo bien."
4.0,I really like these bracelets. They are a bit thick but I still really like them and wear the black one all the time.
4.0,I did not receive the candy dress I received one with lollipops instead. I love the material it is made of and the way it fit my daughter - I really wanted the other dress.  Amazon quickly corrected the mistake.
4.0,"These are like buttah!!! So soft and smooth. They seem like they’ll be reasonably warm for leggings, too. Definitely looking forward to finding out! The only concern I have is that the surface material gives the impression that it might eventually pill. Fingers crossed that it doesn’t, because I really like these!"
4.0,Shiny and flat and nice color
4.0,"The pearls are very nice, good quality, size and price!<br />The only thing is the silver earring on the top where it locks; the lock is very secure but hard to click on, for this reason it feels like you're going to bend/brake it when you lock it up, so, you need to do it very carefully."
4.0,"love the necklace... people ask where did I got this necklace looks beautiful. My wants one as well, I will be buy more"
4.0,"Fit perfectly on my citizen navihawk AT, a little stiff but I'm sure it will break in over time, overall looks good feels good, and a perfect fit. Not that thick."
4.0,"Earrings are very fashionable, but most of all they’re light weight!! My earlobe lives them!!!"
4.0,"Tengo que decir que me encantaron, estas gafas de sol son de lente azul polarizad y además la calidad es excelente, es un estilo clásico y el toque color platinado las hacer ver delicadas y muy lindas. Me gustan porqué son delicadas y livianas y además muy comodas. En lo personal considero que estas gafas de sol son unisex, ya que el estilo de la gafa es plano, sencillo así que le van bien tanto a hombres cómo a mujeres."
4.0,"Idk why i expecred this to be an infinity scarf - probably because of the wat tge picture is, but; uts a very pretty, feminine and light scarf. I bought my 3 favorites and am happy with all."
4.0,"Looks good, great for college, but I have been using it for 2 weeks and it’s starting to tear some."
4.0,"Got so many compliments on this dress and loved it so much, slightly awkward to wear but I rocked it ✌🏼 Wore black & white one with black heels, and also the watermelon pink and black one with tie up black gladiator sandals.<br />I like the black and white dress more than the other colors."
4.0,Love the color..for me it is a little baggy but I am thin. Loved this because I have eczema and in the summer it's hard to find something sleeveless yet mock necked. Overall great buy
4.0,"Very cute, fit loose"
4.0,"This swimsuit is gorgeous!  It looks just like the picture and is sewn very well.  It is sensual, but no too revealing. The top of the suit is accented with a silky chevron patterned lace-like material tied nicely into a bow.  The bra has underwire for support.  The bodice and panty are covered with the same silky chevron patterned lace-like material over nylon/spandex.  The lacy material extends over the panty creating a cute, sheer, skirt.  The back of the suit is open, but has straps that crisscross down to the waist and tie together to secure the look.  I ordered a medium size suit because  both of my daughters wear a size 5; however they have different body types so I had both of them model the suit.  It fit better on my daughter whose bust is smaller.  They both complained that the suit fit tight around their thighs; however I was able to make a minor adjustment and it fit more comfortably.  The suit has a ruched midsection for tummy control.  I highly recommend this suit for any lady who wants to look sexy without revealing too much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased this swimsuit for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  The opinions in this review are based on my personal use of the product and were in no influenced by price or a third party."
4.0,"Great....serve their purpose for around the house.... wasn't expecting anything awesome at this price, but they lasted quite a while before being worn out of shape and if I'm home this is what I wear so they got a lot of use."
4.0,"the quality is good and looks really good on your ear. Had a few complements when I worn them,"
4.0,It took me a while to figure out how to attach the dividers to fit all my stuff. Fits everything I need for a long game night.
4.0,i really liked it but it was too small and i got a size up before ordering it. Otherwise the quality was great and its a bit padded so it keeps you warm. it was an amazing jacket!
4.0,"Really nice dress, material is nice. I did not give it a 5 star because the bust part is over a white/cream lace blue sequin and I did not like the way it looks. Overall, really nice dress."
4.0,Flattering and comfortable blouse actually nicer quality then I was expecting. Fit perfectly according to the company's size chart.
4.0,Cute blazer. Im a U.S size 6 and it was slightly big but still wearable. Its completely lace though so its somewhat see through. A black camisole looks nice under it.
4.0,It's really comfortable but gets kinda loose easily<br />You have adjust it really often
4.0,"Decent for the price however my son is 6'1 and they're a bit short for his liking. About 2-3"" above the knee."
4.0,Colors aren't quite as vibrant as the picture but they will serve their purpose and for a good price
4.0,Love the colors! Love how they feel and have some weight. Happy camper here!
4.0,I love this shirt. Very comfortable and affordable!!
4.0,"The sock garters seem to be well made, but the clips are a bit difficult to open and close and at times the strap that wraps around the calf muscle loosens up after being adjusted to the leg. Also, I noticed that the clips tend to be located more towards the front of the leg than equal distance to the side of the leg, but the sock garters do holdup the socks."
4.0,This is really cute on.. love it
4.0,I picture them bigger but I really like them
4.0,"Here's the deal...The product arrived on time and in good condition.  Very nice, jewelry store quality packaging makes this perfect for gift wrapping and giving as an inspirational present.  The bracelet itself is adjustable and comes in either white or rose 18K gold plating. The words are clearly laser etched and easily readable while the the bracelet itself has a fine fit and finish.  I can't speak to the durability as of yet...but my daughter is going to love it either way.  There you have it."
4.0,"Really thought it would be much smoother, the leather is real but very thin"
4.0,Love love this dress! It was flowy and well-made! I sewed a little clasp into it to make me feel a little more secure than just the tie but the dress stayed all night through a lot of dancing!
4.0,"The birthday charm itself is beautiful, no obvious flaws, clean and the pink color popped it was so crisp. However, the packaging was atrocious, it came in a small pink cinch bag inside of a jewelry box , but the jewelry box was cracked/ missing part f the box in 2 spots not allowing it to close properly. With such a pretty key chain, why would you put it into such a crappy box? It just makes no sense."
4.0,They are okay.  Not great for heavy lifting when your hands are sweaty.  More of a light lifting glove and it keeps hand dexterity very well.  Never did i have to rip off these gloves to get a better feel for something.  I did take them off for heavy lifting though.
4.0,"I like this sweatshirt alot. it is the perfect wieght, and good quality. the only problem is that the sleeves are a little baggy. the sweatshirt definetly runs big, get one size down from your normal size. I always wear medium. I bought a small and it fit great."
4.0,"Nice dress, good quality but I can't figure out how to tie it together. I expected a complete dress but got a dress I have to tie which I didn't expect."
4.0,"I like it, I love it..keep my hands warm yes I will recommend this good to buy, and reasonable price."
4.0,"Light weight material but it’s not cozy fabric. Very flowy! I purchased an XXL and could have gotten away with an XL. It has a cute tie string design on the back at the neck. Ruffles make it so feminine and the pastel green is a perfect color for spring!<br /><br />I am taller with a tall torso and legs, so this dress seems on the short side. Falls about 3-4” above my knees."
4.0,"The double clasps are a good feature, helping to make the fit secure. The latches for adjusting the over the shoulder length are problematic. The latch tends to catch on the fabric of the suspender and the spring is quite strong making it difficult to adjust. I also found that the metal is a bit sharp making me wonder if my shirts fronts will survive the suspenders."
4.0,a little small at top
4.0,Shirt is ok
4.0,"the pants fit just like they should.  The jacket fit was smaller then it should have been.  I decided I am not going to keep the jacket.  However, the pants I will keep and wear for almost anything."
4.0,I like the material they are made of and the color
4.0,These gemstones are super cute for a good price. The product description states some are natural and some are synthetic but honestly they all look and feel synthetic except for a couple maybe. They're still very pretty. Will be purchasing again when I run out
4.0,"It looked a lot like the picture, but it was not as loose at the arms as it looks in the pic.  It was delivered quickly, and in very nice condition."
4.0,"My husband likes it, quality material."
4.0,I love yoga pants.  These are a really nice pair.  I like the way the material looks.  The black inset down the sides is nice.  I ordered a large and the fit is good.  They are snug at first but do loosen up after wearing for a little while.  They're not too snug to be comfortable tho.  I wear these when I work out or when walking in the mornings.  The material is nice and seems to breathe well.  The seams are sewn evenly and I haven't noticed any loose or unraveling threads.  These are nice quality.  The waist has a small inner pocket sewn into it.  Perfect for a key or ID.  The waistband is wide and comfortable.  These don't slide down.  I really dislike having to readjust my waist all the time.  I have washed and dried these.  I didn't notice any shrinking or fading.  Overall this is a really nice pair of yoga pants.  I'm happy with the quality and see getting a lot of use from this pair.<br />I did receive these for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
4.0,TIp is cute but somewhat large. I would suggest ordering a size down
4.0,"I like the dress a lot. I hated to take a star away but it runs very large. I am 5’, 99 lbs. the small felt at least 2 sizes too big. But the good news is I have a sewing machine and was able to quickly make a seam from the inside of the liner, straight up through the dress. Easy peasy. I like that it has a lining. It is some sort of nylon, so it wrinkles easily. I will take a portable steamer to it, as I dislike ironing."
4.0,"shuper shweet,  toot toot!"
4.0,"Nice set of luggage I bought for my mom for her birthday.  They were not as large as I thought they would be, but overall the quality seemed good.  So check the sizes to be sure it meets the size you need."
4.0,Pros: Look good. Great for cosplay or hanging around.<br />Cons: DON'T use while driving. Lens make it impossible to see the traffic lights.
4.0,"This really worked well for The Bridgerton Experience, my issues are that the arms were tight while the shoulders and chest were big. I changed the sash, and had my dress. The price was excellent!"
4.0,"This watch is very neat. Love the style and price, however, beware of trying to remove links. It is extremely difficult. The little tool that came with it to remove links broke on us and somehow my husband wound up breaking skin trying to get the darn things out. My advice would be to go with a different watch just because of this unless you have very large wrists and don't need to take links out."
4.0,This is a great shirt for Chiefs fans. Gave it 4 stars because of the material. It could be a little softer and it shrinks in the wash a bit. It is still a great shirt. Worth the purchase.
4.0,Came on time. The inscription on my ring was a tad smudged so it's hard to read the date that's on it but other than that it's all good
4.0,After searching forever for a queen of hearts costume I finally went with this one for my 11 year old. Used for Halloween and my other daughters 1 year birthday. It was good but disappointed there wasn’t a smaller size. Between kids sizes which suggested going up a size and juniors there really wasn’t a good fit in any of them. Just wish we didn’t have to spend an extra 30 minutes pinning this to make it look right on her.
4.0,This dress fits wonderfully and is what I expected. It is comfortable and a sophisticated type of sexy. It arrived on time and without issues. I would recommend this seller.
4.0,Very pretty dress but I didn't realize it was a dress that has a skirt underneath a see through ankle length skirt. I just assumed it was a dress. Still pretty.
4.0,fits gemstones and pearls up to 8mm perfectly
4.0,Exactly what I expected. Comfortable and fits well
4.0,These bands are so cute! The lace designs allows the band to breathe very nicely. Only flaw is the band is very long. Wish there was sizing options so I didn’t have so much excess hanging over. Overall great purchase.
4.0,Fun colors!
4.0,The quality of the dress felt cheap
4.0,"Pretty okay prop. It doesnt glow as much in the pictures so 4 stars, the yellow part on the blade just glows in the dark instead."
4.0,This is the first cold vest I've tried. I like the ice packs they use they retain cold for quite awhile. The straps take a bit of fiddling but that's what you get for one size fits all. When I use this consistently two times during the day for an hour each time I've noticed weight loss of .5-1lbs per week. I also walk or bike 5 hours per week and try to watch what I eat and I'm not sure what results would be without that. I'd been at a plateau for several months and this helped me get over my weight-loss plateau.
4.0,"Easy to put on/take off, fairly warm, size feels a little small to me compared to other brands' 4."
4.0,The zipper snags the back of my hair am constantly fighting to get my hair loose.... Bert when hair is up.
4.0,I purchased for a wedding and received many compliments. It was a bit expensive though but worth it
4.0,"If you're in-between sizes, I would go with the smaller size. I'm 5'9"", 180 lbs (muscular build), and usually wear size Medium. This was a little on the big side, felt more like a large. It's a pretty dope shirt though. Material is thick, soft, and durable, and the colors are vibrant."
4.0,"Very good quality, nice fabric, only negative point is its price."
4.0,Nice fit and cute!
4.0,The top is slightly big and the bottom is tight. But it fits and it is super comfortable.
4.0,Very pretty.  Nice looking garnet.
4.0,Nice top! Great material also but must go a size down.
4.0,Band is tight on ankle
4.0,"Fits well, looks great. First, I ordered this belt in a 42 because I read somewhere to order the belt one size smaller than the pants waist size. This was a bad piece of advice. So, we tried again and ordered the exact pants size. This time the belt fit perfectly for my dad. It's a great belt, especially to be real leather for the price."
4.0,It’s super cute but the snaps at the bottom are really hard to fasten. It’s true to size and I get a ton of compliments on it but I wish the snaps were better
4.0,"I got these in the mail yesterday. They are a  great product, there were no duplicates in the package. The reason that I'm giving it 4 stars is because the top ball doesn't fit in my mouth like it should. Could just be me, probably is. It's just kinda bulky. I also only found 5 out of the 30 that I would actually wear, but that's also just me being really picky. Great bang for your buck though! Also some of the rings the bottom ball comes off of and others it's the top and I've found 2 that completely come apart top and bottom.. So do yourself a favor and make sure that the ring is tight on both ends!"
4.0,I ordered an XL because another review said this runs super small and the XL fit perfect. I normally wear mediums!
4.0,I like this brand of clothing. this shirt did not disappoint.
4.0,"The fabric is thin and not rugged, but nice. Love the pockets, the longer length and the sleeves that push up comfortably. Makes a good layer over casual dresses."
4.0,Not bad dress for the price. Will be wearing it to a wedding
4.0,"I had the older version of this watch when I was in the Army, it was a great and reliable companion to me, but I'm a bit disappointed that the quality has gone somewhat down in this product.<br /><br />First, don't get me wrong, I love this watch; it has all of the features I want / need and it is stupid simple to program and switch between what you want to do.<br /><br />However, the light on this watch has gone down significantly in quality from the older model. The older model had a great blue backup light that illuminated the whole display crisply and brightly. The one on this model is subpar at best; it illuminates from the side and casts a tiny bit of light across the screen. So only the first number is well lit, and you have to look very closely and very hard in order to see / guess what the other numbers are.<br /><br />This watch could have gotten 5 stars if not for the crappy illuminator. But it's still a dang good buy for the money."
4.0,Needs to be longer. Otherwise a great dress.
4.0,Dress is great but a little bit expensive. You can check it on other website its way cheaper.
4.0,This was very comfortable but color is not as described - it’s more of a pink color.
4.0,Larger than what I needed. The color was nice.
4.0,"This is an oversized top, with that said I’m 5’6” and 150 lbs. it is a drop shoulder top. Super soft! I ordered a large. But it does not cover your behind as it shows in the pictures! I’ll keep it it’s super soft and goes well with jeans."
4.0,These earings are beautiful! They came with extra earing backs and a cleaning cloth.<br />The only issue I have is where the earing piercing is located. It should have been in the middle of the back instead of the top. If you have a large hole in your ear it will show.
4.0,"It's a nice set but it's painted black so any scratch's so up .If you found this review helpful please click the button that says you found this review helpful or the thumbs up tab.

The opinions stated in this review are 100% honest, I am not being paid to review this product nor will I take payment to review a product!"
4.0,"Very nice. One complaint is that it's very difficult to get to the little change compartment. It should be on the outside, not the inside where the bills are kept."
4.0,"These are so pretty in person.  They are delicate and a bit smaller than I was expecting, even when I looked closely at the picture. I judged the size by comparing the design to the fish hook &#34;closure&#34;.  But they are very small, and the fish hook is very small.  I can't imagine these being suitable in size for a grown woman.  For a teenage girl though, these were perfect.<br />The stones were brilliant in the light and looked very pretty.  They didn't appear cloudy or dull at all.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't buy another pair though. I would look around for something a bit more sizable.  Since these were a gift, once I received them, they seemed to small and 'not enough' to give, so I bought a very pretty &#34;Willow Tree Keepsake Box&#34; to put these into.  Then it was a PERFECT gift for a young girl.  A nice keepsake box doesn't have to be expensive, but it helps this gift to become something substantial."
4.0,"Really heavy duty fabric, not a cheap see through pant. I love the fit. They are slightly loose like runners, not completely tight like leggings. I am considering buying another pair. The reason I did not rate 5 stars is because they are polyester. So, eventually they will be stained beyond wearing."
4.0,"I bought this for the same reason most people are buying masks right now, COVID-19. Most stores and restaurants require you to have them so I wanted to have a washable/reusable mask rather than go through a ton of disposable ones. This mask is very comfortable, very breathable, and very silky smooth. I wish it was just a tad bit more snug for my own personal fit, but that’s nothing that can’t be fixed with a small clip in the back. Love the Gator style and being able to just pull it up/down without irritating the backs of my ears with elastic. I would recommend this product."
4.0,"Very pretty ring.  Aquamarine is a very pale blue color.  The stones in my ring aren't as blue as in the picture, but they are still pretty and sparkly.  If you're looking for a lot of blue color, this may not be for you, but I still like it very much and will wear it often."
4.0,They are very comfortable. They are a lititle smaller then I expected. Nice bright red color.
4.0,Great sweatshirt. My 23 year old daughter loves it
4.0,This was a very pretty dress that we used for our daughter who was a flower girl in a wedding. It was very full and pretty . One of the straps did tear after an hour of wearing the dress and thank goodness we were able to do a quick sewing job . Otherwise it was a great buy for the price .
4.0,This dress was a gift for my birthday I am 5 foot 9 and I have a fairly large torso the dress goes to my ankles and I normally wear a size 2x in dresses but for this I had to get a 4X the 4X is slightly big on me but not too horrible I wear a camisole underneath or tank top due to the fact that it is low cut the front and awfully large up top. The colors are vibrant and bright even after a first wash it did not tear on regular wash so I believe it's okay not to put it on delicate if you feel to hand wash it that is fine it's very soft and may appear longer on shorter people than 5 foot 9.
4.0,What is nice and warm.
4.0,"This skirt was a good value but I found it a little bit too long. I am a little shorter, but I had to pull it up to just under my chest to get a good fit. However, once I did that the skirt fit great. It is casual and cute and flows and very versatile."
4.0,Runs small I sized up from a 18 month to a 2t and after washing the shrank a lot and we’re too tight. Great quality for the money but size up two sizes.
4.0,"I love costume jewelry and earrings especially.<br /><br />I love these 2 sets.  Not only are they the perfect size but the stones in them are my childrens birthstones so I got double lucky.  They are small so they do not overpower, but yet big enough that they sparkle and are a nice accent to any outfit.  I like wearing them daily with just jeans and a Tshirt but I can totally see these being worn on a special night out.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of the closure, I have had issues with it coming undone a couple times.  I have been able to move it a few times and get it to snap but for some reason it seems to come off frequently.  My daughter has worn and has no issues, so it is more than likely me as I have read the other reviews and am not seeing them talk about problems.<br /><br />This set is priced well.  These would make a nice gift.  I think these are a good present or can be for wedding, prom or special occasion also.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.  I am not a paid reviewer, I am a mom that does this as a hobby and likes helping others."
4.0,"So cute. I am 5&#34;9 and 145 pounds and ordered a large. I was hesitant to buy because its hard to find things with enough length, but it is plenty long enough.  The only complaint is that it is slightly see through. I will definitely have to wear something underneath but can't beat it for the price."
4.0,Quality is a little lower than other headbands but they hold a lot of sweat and look pretty cool. Great for DDPYoga!
4.0,"This is fine as a casual dress.  The neck  line is very low as are the arm holes so I took 2” out of the straps so it fits better.  As it is a swing shape , that made no difference to the size.  It was exceptionally long also, but with it now 2” less in the straps the hem is 2” shorter and manageable.  This is not a dress I would recommend for people under 5’7”."
4.0,Adorable. Great buy. My daughter loves it. True to size.
4.0,"Se me complico el uso por que me quedaba un poco grande, ademas el detalle de la blusa en la parte de adelante hace prununciar mas el busto."
4.0,Beautiful Dress!  I can’t wait to wear it.
4.0,I got this as a gift for my father.  He loves it.
4.0,"The outfit is absolutely beautiful but I bought it a size bigger than my son wears, as many reviewers suggested, and it was still tight.  The white shirt was too small, the neckline was too tight.  We managed to use it long enough to take pictures one time and then I passed it on to a family member with an infant that can grow into it."
4.0,4 star product
4.0,I purchased this head scarf for my sister who lost all of her hair this year after going through chemo for ovarian cancer. I knew she did not want to do a wig but also refused to go in public bald. I looked around online and found this and purchased it.<br /><br />The head scarf is extremely soft and that was perfect since her scalp was sensitive. We love the colors because you can match it with so many outfits. The one downfall on the headscarf was when we got it there were no directions on different ways to use it. We stood there confused on what to do. So not ever having used these before I think there should be a list of directions on how you can style with them. We were at a loss.<br /><br />I recommend the hair scarf and even though my sister is growing her hair back she is still using it and so do I! We now trade on and off. We love them and have purchased more colors. We are very happy.<br /><br />This product was a personal purchase for myself at normal retail price.
4.0,Arrive in great condition
4.0,Nice necklace.  A little complicated to put on with all the layers twisting I had to have help putting it on. Con: the big coin is blank in the picture but mine has writing on it. .stupid advertising for the company.If I wasn't wearing it for a costume I would return it just for that writing.
4.0,The prettiest little bracelet. Broke when I got it but I managed to reclasp it back together. Quality could be improved but still love it.
4.0,One of the jewels are missing.
4.0,"It is 100% exactly as described you will get what you pay for and what you're paying for is pretty darn awesome I have bought so many different representations of the Auryn necklace over the years and this one is by far the highest quality one that I have been able to find it's got a good heft to it it is not cheap it looks good and it represents to Auryn from the movie extremely well the only issue I had with it is that I am a sweaty Beast of a person and my perspiration dissolved some of the silver paint it is not two different types of metal it is solid bronze which is a good thing the bad thing is that the paint was not of the greatest quality in the universe however this is still absolutely awesome and I would buy it again and recommend it to anybody who was looking for an Auryn necklace, in fact I even recommend not even considering wasting your time getting one of the other options available they will turn different colors they will crack, actually be a two dimensional picture printed on cheap metal and having only having had a clever photograph taken of them for the store image, etc etc... but this one is the real deal. if the paint continues to dissolve, and I do believe it may have ceased doing so at this time, I will just do a little bit of research and probably get some kind of silver shiny nail polish that's not soluble in water at all and be just as happy as if I had the original movie prop in my hand."
4.0,This shirt is so cute!! I ordered a size up and it fits only slightly smaller than what I would prefer but as its from China it's to be expected. I like it enough to order again though!
4.0,"[I ordered mine from Ali Express (not knowing it was sold on Amazon!) so it is possible I got a knockoff, but the one I ordered shows the same photo of the same model so I'm assuming it is the same..]<br /><br />Pros: I love the style, love the colors, it is a very cute suit. It is just the amount of modest that I was looking for (loose-fitting top, covers butt, loose-fitting pants -- I dislike the burkinis with skintight leggings; this one has loose pants)<br /><br />Cons: Too large. I usually wear XS or petite S; since the smallest this came in is Regular Small I took a chance -- the pants fit fine (actually they are shorter than in the photo; fall to just below knee) but the shirt was HUGE. It literally looked like a dress. I hemmed off about 8 inches and then it looked like the photo, though it is still very roomy.<br /><br />Other con: it only lasted one season. Granted, I spent a great deal of time in a chlorinated pool & hung the suit in the sun to dry, so it did get plenty of wear that one season, but in comparison, the Lands End swimsuit I wore underneath (as &#34;underwear&#34;) is totally fine after the same amount of use, whereas this one has to be replaced.  The pants lost all elasticity in the waistband and the fabric has stretched thin all over; it just didn't hold up to the chlorine I guess (I did rinse it in tap water after each swim).<br /><br />In conclusion: This suit could work well for someone who is not very petite and intends it for only light use. It is one of the most attractive modest suits I have found. Enjoy."
4.0,"These are very pretty and fit quite nicely.  I'm 5'6' and 210 lbs.  I doubt, however, that they'll stay up without support for long.."
4.0,Working terrific.  Nice color and large readable face.
4.0,"This was my first experience with a pull-on jean; and I'm impressed.  They fit surprisingly well, stay up when you bend over, and are amazingly comfortable!  However, I ordered the light wash and will never do that again, as they are literally almost 'threadbare' in a couple of areas.  Since these are my new go-to jeans, I want them to last longer than they probably will.  I haven't seen any in tall sizes!?!?  That would be nice since these are just barely long enough (I am 5'6&#34; and purchase a size 6)."
4.0,This was a great graduation bracelet product description was completely accurate and perfect for what I was looking for for the very cheap price I couldn't expect much more so I am satisfied
4.0,Runs very small. Good value otherwise.
4.0,"The hats are super cute and great to have adult and child size. However, the ribbons do not stay on."
4.0,nice gloves...size runs small
4.0,"Nice patterns...could be a little bigger in the cap part, but overall decent hats."
4.0,"Lovely, dainty, and sparkly!  I tried them on and kept them in my ear for a week. One slight drawback is that the crawler slides down at times, but still look good!  Very pleased with this purchase for the price."
4.0,"Appears to be very well made; nice and 'thick', without looking it. That said, my goodness, I am glad I looked at the 'Fit' pop-out feature Amazon utilizes, because I am 5'11, 215, and yes, have a bit of 'pudgy' stomach, but this sweater is extremely form-fitting, and had I not purchased an XXL, there is no way this would have fit...anywhere: Shoulders, Chest, Sleeves, and yes, Abdomen. If you are taller than 6', or weigh more than 220, do not bother with this garment, as sadly, it just will not fit. But since I purchased a size or two larger than I would normally wear, I think it's great."
4.0,"It is comfortable for exercise sessions, and looks good enough to run errands if I don’t have a chance to swap my band. It’s not the smooth installation you get with apple bands but can’t ask for much at this price point. I am happy with my purchase!"
4.0,Had to return and order a full size down for my daughter than what she typically wears. Other than that - good product.
4.0,Longer than I thought but they work great
4.0,I love this brand so much! These are great but a tad thinner then some of the other ones I buy from them. I will still order in another color though bc I love the fit so much.
4.0,I loved the colors of this shirt:)
4.0,"Let's start with what is wrong here. That being that this is not a dress. It is a shirt. It also isn't really a cover up top. It is a shirt. There is a little string that comes with it and I assume it is supposed to wrap around you but there are no loops or anything to run it through. Plus the ends of the string aren't sewn shut and there is a random seem in a weird spot on it like my string was the end of a reel and the just added a bit more. Really do not see myself using it. It's little bat wings don't do much either. You don't even notice them.<br /><br />Now the good. I was nervous about getting this since it was one size. I am not a huge girl...but I am no twig either. I am 5 foot 7 inches, 190 pounds, and my chest is 44DD. I wear a large or extra large depending on the shirt. Surprisingly though this DID fit. It fits nice too. I also love the colors and the patterns. Even with my husband saying it looks like I have an eye on my boobs. And the FEEL. It is 100% polyester and has a nice smooth slick feel. Very very comfortable. So though it was not what it says. Though I suppose on a girl of smaller size and boobs that this could be a dress. I do recommend it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. If for any reason my opinion of the product should change, I will edit my review to reflect that change."
4.0,"The grey one is OK but not ask cool looking as I had hoped. In the pictures it looks like grey stone beads, kind of antique. But it looks pretty plain in person. I'll keep it though because it stays on and is comfortable. I have others by the same company that are very nice."
4.0,But large but better than tight
4.0,"very thick and cute, they have a few loose threads and aren't the best quality, but they are nice warm adorable socks"
4.0,"Something very simple, but also good to have one in the closet. The design of the hook buckle is cute. This Elastic Waistband will do well with loose tops."
4.0,This is a good work shirt.
4.0,"This is really soft and seems to be very well made.  I still have to find the right belt for it but I think this is absolutely wonderful.  It is made from a very lightweight and breathable material so even if it it really hot outside I still stayed really comfortable.  I am always worried about shorts being too short but when I tried this on I was happy to see that they are perfect everything is covered and nothing is left hanging out like with some shorts I feel like my butt is showing in them, not with this.  I also love the fact that I can dress this up for a nice night out or even for work or I can dress it down for a day at the park with my kids.  I will for sure be buying this is the other colors so i can have more of them.  I will also be recommending this to my girls friends for their summer wardrobes.<br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Size down for sure!
4.0,"These are cute, fun socks, BUT when you have toddlers running around the house in socks, you need them to be NON SLIP on the soles. Was disappointed and they definitely need to be more clear bc I only bought these believing they were NON SLIP"
4.0,Opens well but a little harder to close
4.0,"The clarity of the stone is beautiful.. the 4mm was a perfect size, but the 6mm and 8mm was too large.  Also the gap between the stone and the metal was way to obvious.  I would of bought a pack of the 4mm alone if it was available."
4.0,Small but lovely colors.
4.0,Run a little small. My heel hits on the back edge.
4.0,They are hot
4.0,The clasp was a little hard to get on and off at first but it is fine now.  The lettering is a little small.  I like it well enough.
4.0,"I like this nightgown a lot.  However, my arms are on the longer side and the sleeves are short for my liking."
4.0,This is a really cute dress but I had to return it. I bought a small and it fit in the waist perfectly but the bust was too small and the buttons gapped. I also got a medium and it fit in the bust and was a bit big in the waist but I am keeping it because it is such a cute dress. So size up if you have a bigger bust.
4.0,Exactly as described and very nice quality!
4.0,Nice material- cut with a very defined waist if that style works for you body shape.
4.0,My daughter wore this dress for her birthday. It fit well and was comfortable.
4.0,Some of them didn't work wihich was expected from previous reviews I had read but the kids really enjoyed them
4.0,This dress is comfy and pretty. It is see through like the other reviewers stated.  I haven’t decided whether to wear it or not. Still debating on returning due to it being see through.
4.0,"Cute shirt, not sure if its an original Girlie Girl shirt or not. Printed on a Gilden tee so its good quality. Most of my girlie girl shirts from the website say girlie girl on the tag but i do have one that is gilden. The graphic on the back makes it a little stiff but i think after a few washes it will be better. Color is very pretty bright red and the print on the front and back is glittery which i didnt notice in the pictures. I am 5'4'' and 125 lbs and the small fit well. I stretched it out a little because I like my tees loose. Stretched easily but didnt loose shape. If you like your tees very loose i would order up a size?"
4.0,Graphics were impeccable BUT material was super light slippery not warm
4.0,I love it even though the gem is quite small.  My only concern is the ball that goes inside the nose is super tiny. I'm worried that it will pull out too easily.
4.0,Great belt shipped promptly.  a
4.0,Wear socks or you will have a smell disgusting mess
4.0,Not bad. Really cozy but still thin and wearable with shoes.
4.0,Very similar to the Dior split aviator sunglasses
4.0,"I love the color, size and style of this bag.  It's very easy to carry over the shoulder.  Wish you could open it just a little farther, and holy bad smell!!!!!  Overall I would purchase again."
4.0,What I received was just what I expected.
4.0,This worked very well on my wife’s new purse. It cleans and conditions. Very good product at a good price.
4.0,I love mine but unfortunately the screws get lose.. now sure of mine is defective..
4.0,This shirt feels much softer than anticipated. It washes well and the color hasn't faded (even after having it washed a couple dozen times) with other non-white clothes.
4.0,These are cute and fit... I've received several compliments on them.  I took away one star since they came with a minor scratch in the black of the frame in the front.  It's minor and only noticeable up close... but I'd have preferred scratch free of course.
4.0,Was hoping a little thicker but still great bibs.
4.0,"I loved the pattern on the Retro Africa Print High Waist skirt!  It fit as expected, true to size. It's a fun summer skirt that I can wear casual (think picnic) or out with the girls (think HH) or for date night (think movie with BF)."
4.0,"I like these, but I didn’t realize they would be quite so large.  Quality and price good just a little big"
4.0,"Exactly what I expected.  Not an expensive dress in cost, nor quality.  But I loved it."
4.0,Exactly what I ordered.  Came in fast. Looks great. Love it.
4.0,"The term big girl was misleading to me.  The skirt arrived and it was sized for a child.  However,  the quality looked nice and I wish it had been woman size."
4.0,"Cute dress, well made, only thing I didn’t like was the v neck cut. Just a little too high for my taste."
4.0,"Beautiful dress made out of nice material. Love the pattern. Only thing was it was super long, it goes down literally almost to my feet (I'm 5'3&#34; and bought a small)."
4.0,It is so very small .
4.0,"When I tried on the shirt it was shorter than I expected. I cannot put my arms up, otherwise, my bra would be showing. The material is good and not itchy. The one other concern is the stitching, there was some stitching on the outside of the right sleeve.  But other than that, the product is pretty good."
4.0,"It's so soft and comfortable without being too big and fluffy. It has a nice rubber bottom for traction. Without socks, my feet get a little sweaty, though. Also, I would suggest getting a size larger. I wear a size 8/8.5 and got a size 8 or L(9/10), but my toes push up against the front of the shoe and is a bit uncomfortable if I wear it too long. However, they are cute and warm."
4.0,"Very nice, although the chain seems small. I like it."
4.0,"These slippers fit as expected and keep my feet warm, which is the reason I bought them. They are a little snug, I wear a 10.5 shoe. I would not recommend them for anything other than wearing them around the house or getting the mail at the end of the driveway. I would not do any long distance walking in them. The sole is soft for walking around the house, but I think think it would flatten out for any long distance walk.<br />Overall. they are a good slipper for the price which is what I would imagine they were meant to be."
4.0,Very light & comfortable pants for sleep or lounge around.
4.0,"I was surprised by this item and how nice it actually is. The lining has a watermark on it which isn't super classy, but the exterior is plush and soft, and the color is nearly true to the picture (it is more vibrant but still a cool red/burgundy). This is like a long fur blanket basically.<br /><br />I overestimated my confidence with this purchase and it ultimately felt too flashy for me to be comfortable in, but if you're sure you can rock it, this is a good buy."
4.0,"Fit well and made well. Also, Arrived very quickly."
4.0,"Great conversation item. Works great. Fortunately I researched how it works before buying,  because it had no instructions with it."
4.0,This dress fits really well. Perfect!!
4.0,"I own many different types of pendants and all of them need to make a statement.  This Bio-hazard symbol is nothing like I've ever seen and I like it very much.  I swapped the leather band and I'm using a metal popcorn sterling silver chain instead to complete the look. One warning: The points are extremely sharp so be careful if its going to be a gift to a child.<br />You can't beat the quality for the fair price you pay.  Dan Jewlers is an Amazon Prime affiliate so I received it in only 2 days.<br /><br />I recommend!!<br /><br />Thank You,<br /><br />MJTuc..."
4.0,Good Nursing Work Bag
4.0,Love! Arms are a little smaller/snug.
4.0,"These sandals are fantastic for the price. My son can even wear them to school and run around in them at recess playing kickball.  I would definitely recommend these for a nicer pair of sandals, but still comfortable."
4.0,"Five of the four pair fit perfectly. One pair was tight in the heel and uncomfortable. Also, it had loose threads that caught on my toenails. I love the other five, however, and wear them pretty much every day."
4.0,"Very nice shirt. Stretchy, thick material. A loose and boxy fit. I only took off a star because it’s a little tricky to tell which way is the front and which is the back."
4.0,I absolutely love the material. So sofr and comfortable. I just love lounging around in them
4.0,They were very nice however useless because they didn't fit
4.0,Bought for my daughter was a lil smaller than I expected but cute non the less.<br />remove backing and it looks like addressed envelope.
4.0,"I ordered a size up in case of shrinkage.  I dyed one a lovely teal colour and the other a beautiful fall harvest orange color.  The fabric is pure cotton which is why I bought them, but they wrinkle like crazy.  I'll be nice and cool around the farm this summer where white just doesn't work."
4.0,Requires some break in time. Turning knob has quite sharp edges.
4.0,Like the item very much.  No problems
4.0,"It is good for the price, but had a small white spot on one side."
4.0,Great purchased for the price. Glasses were a little more old man style than I expected but great for driving
4.0,"It was very nice, but it was too small . Took too long to get it ."
4.0,Great product but I need the next size up
4.0,"Very comfortable!!!<br />I gave it a 4 stars because for $25 the quality is not what I expected. I wanted to feel a little bit more the  REAL jeans texture versus skinny spandex type of fabric, if it make sense. I spend so much time looking for a jean short!"
4.0,I have just received this bag today and I absolutely love it! The color is exactly as it appears on the website! It was the exact color I was looking for and it is beautiful!
4.0,"I love this! The only complaint I have is that the boob area is wayyyyyyy to low, by that i mean like nipple and all out. I sewed the straps so it would come up higher and now its perfect. I think this wouldn't be an issue for people with bigger boobs or who are taller than me. I am 5'2 and I wear a  34B."
4.0,"I read a ton of reviews before purchasing this because I was very nervous about ordering a bathing suit online.  I do feel as though the sizing runs just slightly small.  I usually wear a size 4-6 and I took the advice of several reviews and ordered a size larger (6-8).  It fits pretty good.  The top is a little big because I am NOT at all busty, but it's able to be managed by adjusting the straps a little tighter.  The cups that are in it are horrible in my opinion.  They have a lot of shape to them, and make your chest look as though it's pointing outward toward your arm pits.  I took them out and put in flatter ones from an old suit and it's much better.  I feel like a got a good value with this purchase."
4.0,"Pretty good quality for the price you pay. Runs big. I'm 5'3&#34;, 150 lbs, DD cup and the large was a LITTLE too big on me. It fits but I could probably wear a medium for more support in the bust area. Black petticoat underneath is not included. The skirt is not solid in the back, it splits up the middle over the behind. It's a fairly good product overall. I'd buy it again."
4.0,it is nice item
4.0,"I purchased this costume for a Halloween party. The leggings/tights are very small. I will need to recreate them on an existing pair of leggings. The costume however fits really well. I am a 2x top and a 1x bottom. I have room on both sides. It's more of a drop waist than it appears but on my 5'4"" frame, it looks really cute. The gloves fit perfectly. I just hope no one else at the party is wearing it. LOL - I purchased a cosplay wig in Black/Blue to go with it."
4.0,"If you like trains, this thing is for you. Easy to pull up."
4.0,Great watch Easy to read Nice metal arm band
4.0,"Lightweight, Pretty"
4.0,"The skirt arrived today. I like it. I ordered a size small and it looks great! The length is just above my knees so it wears nicely with heels, high leg boots or low heels. The fabric is thin but perfect for faux material and certainly for the price.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because the color is off. I ordered a red but it’s more like a Russ...but it’s still very nice. I was just hoping for red."
4.0,"I love how this shirt is fitted in the bust but flares out just enough around the belly area to hide my after baby pouch without looking like a maternity shirt. I would have given 5 stars but, as I find with a lot of shirts, its fits great everywhere except under the armpit area its a little loose. Luckily its not bad enough that it extremely noticable and uncomfortable."
4.0,"nice item, good quality!"
4.0,"Cute shirt, a little bit short."
4.0,The first time I connected it to the watch it was very hard to get to clasp into place. Since then I havent had a lot of trouble when switching bands. It is really nice that it comes with a tool that helps to remove links and makes it super easy.
4.0,"It's a bit boxey, but it has very nice stretchy, yet structured fabric, nice seams and finishes. The color is true to the picture, the cut is flattering, although, it runs a bit large, I bought the XL. I usually buy EU 44/ US12, but I'm a 32E, so normally a large is too tight on top. I would describe the fit as (EU 46/ US 14-16). If you are busty, this adds to the boxiness with the broad-shoulder cut of the design. The length was perfect for me (5'6/170cm). Nb! Be careful when you iron it, use the lowest possible setting, there are no labels explaining the textile makeup."
4.0,"My trusted Key Ring of almost 40 years broker recently, and I couldn't find a duplicate ... enter the search and this is what I landed on. It's EASY to add or remove Keys, and that's what it's all about! I did add the Apor Leather Key ring and replaced the 'nail braking' Rings with this - total about $15 bucks and I'm ready for another 40 Years! Highly Recommended!!"
4.0,Received my earrings yesterday. I love the look at them! Only reason why I gave a 4 star review was becuase when I received them they were all bunched up in the package ( maybe from shipping ) but also they gave me 2 or the same color for the backing part when it was supposed to be 3 separate colors. As in the picture. Other than that I love the way they look. Will reccomend
4.0,I am extremely happy that this came with the inseam '32 option.  I purchased the large and they fit as I expected. The shipping time was perfect and the material is good quality.  I would purchase again.
4.0,"Love them but the pink ones broke within the first week. For the price, still a good buy, I think."
4.0,"great colors nice quality  would recommend these sock to other people. they are worth the, money, and are a good value"
4.0,"Wish the band was a bit bigger I have a large wrist no option for a longer band length, it stops half way around my wrist. I like the style a lot it matches most of my outfits but the clasp in the back loosens as I wear it and I constantly have to re tighten it. Over all good for 20 bucks"
4.0,Little small for me pinches the nose but works well. I know its not for welding but welded in my truck cab for an hour and didnt get that sick feeling.
4.0,Smaller than expected but still cute. Gave as a gift and she loved them!
4.0,"Super cute, a little small but I would order them again."
4.0,Very nice quality bag for the price- bought the small one for a purse.  May purchase larger one for a tote bag.  Only change I might make would be to make the handles just a tad bit wider.
4.0,This dress was everything I order white but more silver giltter.. it fitted perfect will be wearing it again.
4.0,"It wasn't as clingy as I was afraid it would be, but it was longer than I expected, ( but I am only 5'2"") If I keep it I will need to hem it. I was also hoping the lacy cover was longer than it is, it doesn't cover as much as I was hoping."
4.0,I love it but its way to tight for me I gave it to a friend.<br />It felt like my head had rubber band on it.<br />I have a pretty small head too. Super soft and cute though.
4.0,Sizing is accurate however if you want more of a compression feel I would suggest getting one size smaller.
4.0,Hard to get through a piercing and hard to close/open. But great quality and so cute looking...good quality
4.0,Nice looking watch winder. Keeps my automatic watch running right on time. Expensive looking at a reasonable price.
4.0,So easy to wrinkle and thinner than expected.  Good for a night out but looks frumpy by end of a work day.
4.0,"My husband wears a size 8, so they were a little long for him. They look great and he loves them. They went perfect with his marathon Crenshaw shirt."
4.0,I really like this shirt but I wish I would have known the chiffon material lined the whole front of the shirt. I assumed it was just a piece along the bottom portion of the shirt. The lining constricts the bust area.
4.0,Very nice piece at an unbelievable price .
4.0,"Very pretty, soft, and lightweight."
4.0,"I loved this butterfly nose stud, it kept coming off unfortunately and down my drain it went☹"
4.0,"My shoe size is an American women's 8 to 8.5 and I ordered a size medium. These shoes are comically large on me, which makes them difficult to walk in. They are great for sitting down though, as they are very soft and plush. The penguin design is fun and festive for the winter season. If you have bigger feet and are in need of some slippers, this is a good choice."
4.0,"Nice belt for the money, it has a square metal base near the flat of the d ring, kinda annoying. But it does look good and work good. It's nice that they had xl sizes as this becomes harder to find. Ok product."
4.0,Pretty but not flattering for a petite woman.
4.0,A little longer length than I like but I am a short girl so that is typical for me. Overall I like it. It has an vintage feel which flatters me.  Pairs nicely with colored beaded necklace and heels. I’ve mostly worn this to work. Very comfortable. Love the pockets!
4.0,"It’s cute the only thing is the fabric doesn’t breath. It is very warm good is it winter. But at work,  teaching I’m moving a lot and I feel claustrophobic in it."
4.0,"Giving 4 stars only because the shipping cost almost as much as the beanie, and shipping was slow. However, product is great, well made and we love it!"
4.0,It is cute but rather small for an XL
4.0,"I have had my fair share of waist trimmer belts. Since being diagnosed with MS it has been much harder to loose weight. This particular one is not as good but works. When I work out I can sweat much more then I would. I am able to to use this belt a long with my husband. Its portable and lightweight, I barely feel it on. I would be careful and not to keep it on too long because you can end up getting a rash.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Great Gift.<br />Affordable.<br />Easy to use.<br />Easy to clean.<br />Adjustable Waist.<br />For men or women.<br />Sturdy and durable.<br />Efficient and reliable.<br />Neoprene Waist belt.<br />Portable and lightweight.<br />Comfortable and convenient.<br />Helps Melt Away Unwanted Flab.<br /><br />CONS:<br />No complaints as of now.<br /><br />Over ALL, I recommend getting this &#34;Adjustable Waist Trimmer Belt by Ztretch Pro Gear - Melt Away Unwanted Flab - Strengthen Your Core!&#34; if your looking for more ways to help loose weight."
4.0,Exellent price but you would NOT like this shoes if you normally wear width size shoewear . It feels a bit too narrow.
4.0,"The dress is very light and comfortable. Im size 12. My height is 5'3 and i got size L. I wore 3inch high heels on this dress so it wont touch the ground. Its just odd the way it fits thru chest area, seems like this is perfect for the girls that have a size C or more. Im size 36- 38 B."
4.0,"I think I will love these pants, but they are too large. I am returning them for a size smaller.  If they fit, I think I will love them!"
4.0,It was a little too small so I ended up returning it for a bigger size.  I love it. Really nice material and its just georgeous
4.0,"Normally, as a petite woman, I wouldn't wear horizontal stripes, but, for some reason, this really looks great on.  I think it's because it fits perfectly around the bust but has a pretty flare from there, making the proportions work beautifully with cropped black leggings and high-heeled sandals."
4.0,Loved my boots.
4.0,"The older versions of these had more gel in them, and puffed up like have a cool sausage 'round my neck. The newer batch is remiss in that way."
4.0,"I purchased this watch last summer and was pleasently surprised when I opened the box. It is heavy, nice band, with a big face, looks awesome, especially in the summer months. Always get compliments when I rock this watch. This was my third white ceramic watch. One I returned if you check my previous reviews you will see why.<br /><br />The other was Roberto Bianci Men's B264_wht Persida Watch which is equally as nice as the Oniss. For me these are not everyday watches, something to rock on the weekends, but anyone looking for a white watch will have different requirements.<br /><br />I wanted as much white as possible, no silver, or black etc...If I had to choose I probably prefer the Persida. But I also wanted to check out a white ceramic watch by Sottomarino & Mens Chisel White Ceramic watch, which I have seen from $300 to $800 go figure..."
4.0,"These 2 sets of earrings are really beautiful in design, but I had a hard time inserting them because of the shape and the wire post bends a bit. I love the look and they don’t weigh down or stretch my lobe, but when the French hooks dangle, they turn a little ...so that could be difficult to see the earring. I was unable to insert the rounded on at all. I love the French hook, but not a fan of the spiral earrings. Nice looking earrings and I prefer the French hooks."
4.0,"Minus the head piece. Tightest thing ever, I suffered it through photos but had to remove quick. Definitely expect to buy one separately."
4.0,"These are slightly smaller than the typical ball cap but still fit. With this large variety of colers and number of hats I may never need to buy another one.<br /><br />Please press ""helpful"" if you learned or laughed to anything in this review! Thanks!"
4.0,They look nice and feel good.
4.0,"Perfect lightweight robe for summer! High quality, covers my bum, and pretty colors."
4.0,"While this is the best Spider Gwen costume we have found, getting it on and off a 5 year old is a little difficult. Maybe make the gloves and feet removable with velcro. The eye holes are also a little high on the head and hard to see through, but easily taken off and worn without. It won't stop us from wearing it but it will make me think twice about this type of design."
4.0,"Would have been a five star review, but the heel is a bit too high."
4.0,Not for my  inverted triangle body type.
4.0,"I bought these as a gift for my mother, she loves them."
4.0,"it was good, it was for my son, he liked it."
4.0,Looks beautiful but the bow pin broke on first wear
4.0,"Good quality, not quite as comfortable as I expected."
4.0,"I am a 38D and this was a bit snug.<br />It did fit, and I took the padding out.<br />I loved this under a deep vneck dress."
4.0,"They are very nice and just the right size for what I needed them for. I use these charms to decorate a graduation photo album, cards and key chain. The remaining charms will be used on cards birthday thank you gifts.<br />Maxsmoothandgroovy"
4.0,It came with hidden damage. Lack of quality control. Sent back.<br />Update 7/16/20: Received replacement. It is good now. Upgrading  only to 4 stars from 1 star because of first shipment (had to drive to UPS to send defective item).
4.0,"A really cute dress. I would have liked the poka. dots smaller  ,quite a bit smaller. They are a bit alarming. Maybe too alarming for me, I haven't decided. I guess that's why you didn't show them up on the picture. My daughter really liked it so it might just be me. But all in all its a great dress and I'll be so thankful when the weather gets hot. Thanks"
4.0,"I like this as a Patriotic Headwrap. It doesn't stay up as a ""Mask"" for this Mandatory face covering. I'll still attempt to wear to anger my Un-American Neighbor HOOD. Because it OFFENDS them! It's the USA!"
4.0,It’s so cute and looks great on!
4.0,"I received this as a gift for Christmas this past year from my mother-in-law...I know...great stuff! Coach bags are close to the top of my list on my favorite designer handbags. What is unique about this purse is that it has what I call a racing stripe down the middle. At first I was really not that fond of the stripe down the middle and to be honest it is still growing on me...hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />Some of the features that I love are:<br />-An open outer pocket that can fit my keys and cell phone. It is very handy and helps you avoid the whole digging through the bottom of your purse thing!<br />-It is really roomy inside without being or looking bulky. I am a wife and mom and my purses need to carry some heavy duty things around with it. I was able to fit my large wallet, large water bottle, 2 glasses cases, hand sanitize, cosmetics, snacks, etc. with complete ease.<br />-Versatile compartments. It has 2 inner pockets and both are great sizes to fit toiletry items and more.<br /><br />The feel and sturdiness of this purse is amazing. I guarantee that almost anyone will be happy with this purse."
4.0,"The camo is gorgeous and the shirt pattern adorable and trendy. Unfortunately is runs very small, so I had to return it."
4.0,"This is a cute tank overall.  The only issue is the graphic is very stiff and sticky.  Hopefully,  it will soften up after washing some. The tank itself is nice and soft."
4.0,Comfortable and gets the job done. No complaints so far
4.0,Received as ordered and fit well. Overall a nice replacement. for my Oakley Juliets.
4.0,"Bought this for a wedding I’m going to next month. It’s good for the price, the material is a little stretchy, it feels nice on. I have a hard time finding more fitted dresses and tops because I wear a DDDD bra, I figured this was the case with this as well, so I ordered a size up. It still doesn’t fit right, the lace comes forward over my shoulder a bit, it doesn’t look bad though since there isn’t really a seam for the shoulder like a shirt has. It will be perfect for my needs, and at $20 it’s a steal. I removed one star because it smelled very strong of perfume, not sure if it was worn and returned or if the manufacturer does this. I was going to wash it anyway, so not a big deal."
4.0,"Product quality is ok but the fit is very small. Order a size or two up. Otherwise, it will fit very tight."
4.0,Really cute but I would say it runs big! Washed and put it in the dryer to try and shrink it down before using. Still a bit big but comfy and cute nonetheless!
4.0,"This top is really cute, I love the way it looks on me. I wanna buy another one."
4.0,"I hate to give these ratings because they are not indicative of the actual product. I had to base my rating on MY specific situation. I have varicose veins and unfortunately extra weight, and this makes them tight and uncomfortable against my veins that are especially tender. They are fine on my right leg."
4.0,"With so many waist trainers on the market, it’s really difficult to choose one. My first order was a bit small, but that was my mistake by not ordering true to size. In any event, im absolutely thrilled with the product, the quality of the material seems durable to withstand time.<br /><br />The boning is comfortable & the double compression is adjustable and comfortable as well. I wore it in the gym and while it didn’t make me sweat as much as a typical ‘sweat belt’, it kept my posture & form intact which I loved. This will definitely be my go to for gym workouts for THIS reason!"
4.0,"Tag info: Made in China 100% Polyester. Machine wash cold, hang to dry.<br /><br />Ugh you are not suppose to put it in the dryer, although I'd probably still put it in on low. If I could have found a way to make this shirt work it would have been an issue. I read the reviews and noticed some had issues with the crop being too short, since I'm only 5'2"" I hoped Id be able to avoid that issue. And technically I did, it actually comes just to my navel, so on me its not even really that cropped. Problem is that its a very boxy cut soooo it looks awful. Seriously I look 15lbs heavier. I tried putting it over a white form fitting dress instead, nope same issue. I'm the same width from my shoulders to my hips in this and it's not a good look. Oh well.<br /><br />Material is great and pretty opaque, cut is just not workable. Colors are bright and don't bleed into one another. If you  can get this to work (maybe taller than me or slimmer through the bust) it really would be a nice shirt."
4.0,"Runs small, but this is a speedo style suit, should it be different?"
4.0,"The hat has a funny shape, not sure how much is the fault of the hat or my husband's head. Overall the hat is good. The stitching is really nice, not so sure about the &#34;carbon fiber&#34; insert but it does give it some originality."
4.0,"I bought this for $8.47 + tax (on prime, free 2 day shipping) as a BACK UP for a more expensive and beautiful french maid outfit and accessories because this outfit was too cheap to pass up. I was skeptical of how good the quality was going to be - and rightfully so. The white criss cross lace on the front of the outfit was so ridiculously delicate that they started pulling apart a little before I tried on the outfit (so handle with care). I'm a M and when I put the dress on a few tore off, particularly on the chest area (the larger your overall size or your chest area is, the likelier you'll stretch out the outfit and rip the white lace, but even if you aren't that big you might tear the white lace so maybe re-enforce the lace by sowing on that area BEFORE trying it on). The thing is, that white lace string is not something you can take OFF the dress or adjust, it is SOWN on the dress so although the dress itself stretches and is one size fits all, the white lace does NOT adjust (it can't be pulled out either) and it is not sown in all that well to begin with. But for $8.47 I didn't mind sowing the white lace I tore out. The dress itself is not easy to rip (trust me). Anyway, yes the quality is kind of poor (especially of the accessories) but with that being said when you throw everything together it LOOKS cute, so I think it's worth the price (currently as I am writing this review it is being sold for 13.99 free shipping... still worth it). I did NOT use it as my Halloween outfit because my pricier one was prettier but I don't regret buying this one and I would recommend it to someone (my only warning is that it's short, and keep in mind that the bigger you are the higher it will go).<br /><br />P.S. The apron is NOT detachable."
4.0,My customer was very pleased as it fit her daughter very well
4.0,I like the high waisted bikini and the top is especially cute. It feels supportive and stayed put during a water aerobics class. My only complaint is that it runs small. I normally wear a large and ordered a large. I weigh 150 pounds. This fits more like a medium. You may want to upsize if you get this suit.
4.0,"These are about half the size of what the models are wearing in the picture.<br />Other than that, these are super cute, light weight and feel like sturdy, good quality.<br />I like them a lot."
4.0,I wish it had the quick release pin. Other than that I'm happy with it.<br />23mm navy blue on my Casio Pro Trek PRW-50 .
4.0,"The sweater is super cute and soft. It looks like the picture. I was hoping it would be a little bit longer as I have a longer torso, but it still looks and fits fine."
4.0,Needed something more fancy
4.0,"Great for little kids, cute, and good for the price. Chain is longer than i thought it would be since it seems like it's for little girls (quality wise) and the big sis little sis charms are much bigger than I thought they would be. Overall. Cute gift for my daughter to give her big sister."
4.0,A nice slipper for the price! Very comfortable.
4.0,Runs large but over good quality
4.0,Good quality of the material and very polite seller.<br />I bought an XXL trying to use as a short dress but this is not as long as it appears on the pic.
4.0,Pequeño para mi gusto
4.0,it's nice & it adds to my neck..
4.0,"This is really pretty. I've only worn it a few times but I get compliments when I do. It seems well made and not flimsy. A warning though, if you have long hair it will get tangled up in the petals of the flowers so it's better to wear your hair up if you're wearing this necklace."
4.0,"These are adorable & my daughters favorite shoe! however, the inside liner did start to wear & pull out after only a month or 2 so she couldn't wear them anymore. Great for beginner walkers but probably not for everyday heavy wear"
4.0,Not a bad piece of jewelry. Feels a little cheap but it also wasn't $100 so...
4.0,As others posted this shirt fits very small.  I am typically a small and went with a medium.  Once the medium arrived I realized it wasn’t going to work and returned it for an XL.  The XL was perfect.
4.0,"This is a pretty easy and simple band replacement. Works great and is easily adjustable to fit your size with multiple removable links. The tools included to remove them are very handy as well. It does wear quickly on the surface though which is not a great selling point. Overall though for the price, they are solid replacement bands."
4.0,Nice shirt but fit a bit small.
4.0,"Its like cotton, not too soft but not scratchy or anything"
4.0,Very stretchy and has a nice adjustable strap. My only issue is it loosens up after wearing it for awhile even after adjusting it. It’s comfortable and super cute. I would definitely think about ordering another.
4.0,"I like this wallet. I dont LOVE it, but its gets the job done.<br /><br />The leather is softer than I would expect so it does stretch a bit. Sometimes the snap on the front comes undone, but it only seems to do so if the outside flap is PACKED with cards (I just moved some of them to the side against the wallet and its fine).<br /><br />I havent had any problems with the zipper as others mentioned BUT the little fabric piece on the zipper pull did break about a month into daily usage. ALSO the clip holding the wrist strap broke and would never close completely so the wallet fell off the strap once or twice. I just replaced it with my own and its fine.<br /><br />OH! But, inside the pouch part, theres another 3-4 card slots. Long story short - they dont work. The piece of fabric inside the slots to separate each card is cheaply glued in so they all basically broke once I used them. ALSO these slots seemed WAY smaller than the other card slots (and they're horizontal and not verticle).<br /><br />Even with all that said, I still use it and dont plan on getting a new one yet.  Its definitely convenient to be able to just fit my Note3 in the pouch when going to bars and what not. I have the zipper pull on a lanyard now so I can slip it over my shoulder."
4.0,"This is a very cute and dainty ring to wear on an everyday basis. The tone of the rose gold matches perfectly with my 14k rose gold wedding ring. I have not noticed any discoloration yet; I wear it everyday and even wash my hands, take showers/baths with it. The only reason I knocked off one star is that the stones aren't the best quality (doesn't have very good sparkle quality as I would have liked) but for the price you pay that is not a big deal. Nonetheless, I love wearing this ring and have received many compliments on it."
4.0,Bought to be a swimsuit cover. Fits well and like how it's a little longer in back so I feel like I really could wear anywhere. Do wonder if it will pill.
4.0,I am very impressed with this necklace! Looks better in real life than the picture. Real nice piece of jewelry for the money. Will not disappoint you!
4.0,"Only thing I didn't like is that when I did stairs with it, it grabs /rubs the thigh little. It's not elastic /stretchy on the end of the shorts.  Probably won't matter if just walking or jogging.  Only when having to lift knees higher like when doing a step machine squatting"
4.0,"Perfect for taking to a sporting event. Enough room for my wallet, sunglasses, and small umbrella but small enough to not be cumbersome."
4.0,"I love it but the band seems fragile because it's a little thin... Hmmm... I just make sure I'm careful to avoid breaking it. It's true to size, btw."
4.0,Great dress for the price. Quality materials. Lots of compliments at a wedding. It was comfortable to wear and dance in. My only complaint is that the sleeves were a little loosely fitting on my arms.
4.0,"Super adorable and a bit hit at work.<br /><br />Note: For people with darker than fair skin, the &#34;translucent&#34; parts really aren't. They're really just pale and will show up against darker skin tones.<br /><br />Also, made my feet super-sweaty at the end of the day :p"
4.0,"It is beautiful, but it doesn.t match my earrings, ring and necklace. It is too light in color.  Do you have a darker color blue available?"
4.0,They work as well as any other. About all I can say about them.
4.0,Good overall for the price
4.0,"Very cute, I wouldn't expect it to be in my normal wardrobe but cute for the fall holidays."
4.0,"It came on time, good cuality, my daughter likes it."
4.0,"really comfortable, wii purchase more"
4.0,"Cute top, though the material is a little rough."
4.0,I love this hat so much but I don't like how the d looks like a p -_- other than that I love it
4.0,"Solo tener cuidado al elegir los size, son tallas grandes"
4.0,They are good quality like the other uggs but do run very small. I got these for my wife another Christmas gift she is a size 7 in all shoes I read the reviews and decided I would get an 8. Darn it if they still are not tight! But she likes them so all good
4.0,I got this the other day and really like it! I feel the lining could be higher quality but for the price it's not too big a deal.
4.0,"A little small, but does the job well!"
4.0,"This is a lovely purse - the size is great.  The color on the monitor was pink, which I wanted.  The descriptide wa accurate - mauve."
4.0,Pretty earrings but just a little too shiny for my taste.
4.0,It looks cute
4.0,"I'm 5'5, about 150 and I ordered this in a medium. The romper is of good quality material and fit pretty much true to size. I had two issues with this product. The first is that the shorts were shorter than expected which caused a slight camel toe issue in the front. It was nothing that pulling on the fabric to stretch it out couldn't fix. With the shorts being so short, I thought I would at least be okay with the skirt covering the back, but from certain angles and lighting it was see through. It looked as though I had on super short boy shorts from the back. I have some thighs on me, but not much booty, so I didn't expect the shorts to rise so much in the back. I ended up putting a skirt on over the shorts which caused some bunching in the back, but it was the only way to make it appropriate for my cousin's wedding."
4.0,"These were a gift for my sister who admired a pair I owned (not purchased via Amazon).  They are just the right size, not too flashy but simple enough for T shirts and dressy enough for work."
4.0,"Nice light weight, comfortable pants. Only complaint would be that it only had one back pocket.  Four pockets in the front, but only one back pocket?"
4.0,Cute shoe but too small
4.0,Comfy insoles at a good price.
4.0,Perfect gloves for winter! Works good for work and for putting out hay!!
4.0,"Quality is better than expected, but I have to return because it's too tight on top.  Really cute dress though."
4.0,"I love this Hi lo shirt!!! Very comfortable. It took a while to get shipped and is a little long, but I'm 5&#34;1. Awesome look!!!"
4.0,It was delivered on time. It looks very nice. The sizes run a bit short. It’s better to order next size.
4.0,"Love theses shorts! Fit nicely and ate well constructed .  I already had a pair , so ordered these to have an extra . Didn't give 5 stars because there We a tad smaller that the ones I have which are the same size ."
4.0,"I am typically a size 10 (5'10"") 34D bust, so based on reviews I ordered an XL. It was very (uniformly) baggy, so I will need to return. I would probably re-order a MED as the fabric is very stretchy. It is a nice looking dress. Something you could wear to the office or a wedding. It is however a LOT darker green than the photo. I would describe it more as evergreen, though not as dark as a pine tree. It is definitely not a kelly or christmas green like the photo shows."
4.0,"It's very well made and looks very nice. I think people will really like it. I was looking for a shorter, wider purse where I could look inside and find things quickly. This purse is taller than I would like but that's just my preference. I miss the outside pockets of my old purse for storing my cell phone and other things I need quickly, but it is over all a well made purse:)"
4.0,Nice but its stick to my face when i dance :)
4.0,Good quality dress for the price.
4.0,"I would call this red, not wine red. Other than that, it’s great. Very soft & comfy. I would recommend."
4.0,"Big enough. Fits snugly, not too tight or too loose. A little darker shade than I expected. Could be brighter."
4.0,Timely shipment - product as described -
4.0,"I really liked this dress...it comes with a sirwal (pants) that might make you look a little buffy, but you need to wear it because your ankles would show through the shorter skirt material. I have to say though that the picture might have looked a little fancier than the actual dress. I still liked it though and going to wear it for a wedding :)"
4.0,Perfect to wear with anything..
4.0,"Great idea, and overall, happy with the purchase. We ordered a newborn size after our baby was drowning in the three month size. My only criticism is that, while the rest of it is easy to maneuver, the legs are challenging to get feet into."
4.0,My daughter love this.<br />I gave 4 stars because yellow stain comes out in the first wash.
4.0,Very small but cute for a toddler
4.0,Love it just a little to thin you can see through it.
4.0,"The bra is way smaller than it says. The pads are circles not tear drops and are rather small in a large pocket....but I never wear the pads. The material is comfortable and if I was less endowed, I’m sure that this bra would do the trick."
4.0,This is super cute and fits as expected. The fabric is a little itchy inside but not too bad with layers.
4.0,"I'm 5'8, 165lb, and have broad shoulders from all my years of competitive swimming. Was a little nervous that this dress was not going to fit very well but I am glad I rolled the dice. The length hits right at my ankles and wish it was an inch longer; I will be wearing flats with this one. Overall, the dress is super cute and light weight. Looking forward to wearing this dress to wine tasting."
4.0,"The fabric is of good quality.  The length is about an inch or two shorter than I expected.  It's at my knees.  I'm 5&#34;6 and 114 lbs.  The extra small just barely fits.  If I eat a big meal, it'll be a bit too tight."
4.0,"It's a watch band.  It looks and feels like the original band.  My watch hasn't fallen off my wrist, so it's working."
4.0,Really nice looking necklace at quite an affordable price.  Necklace is just as pictured.  Speedy transaction.
4.0,These hand bands do the trick and are very comfortable. Great value for the price.
4.0,"Pretty but a snug fit, more like a junior size."
4.0,"They work, but the material can rip"
4.0,"Nice material, nice design n fit but only thing is its a little bit short than its suppose to be. Other than that its perfect<br />P.s. Stitching needs a bit of work. Threads are coming off."
4.0,My son bought these for him and his girlfriend. They are cute but they don't like to loosen and tighten. The knots around the thread are tight and it's almost impossible to get them to move
4.0,"I ordered this jacket to replace a similar plum colored athletic jacket I have.  I love the jacket, except the color is more like an off-black.  I wanted to where the jacket with black pants, but it is almost too dark."
4.0,Bought these for yoga but they still slide off and slip into my shoes.
4.0,Material is cheap but you get what you pay for. It fits nice though and at least it is not see through. I loved how easy it is to put on when wrapping the top around your neck. Loved it for the price 👌
4.0,"I have tried the yoga socks.  I was not use to it in first place, but now they seems okay.  You won't get slippery on your feet and it helps protect your toes and not putting too much pressure on them while you are doing yoga on your yoga mat"
4.0,The best shoes for a 5 year old girl! This is our 3rd pair! ❤️❤️❤️
4.0,I like these bags except that the shoulder straps are not long enough. If you do not have to walk far when carrying the bags they’d be great. They fold very easily and are very roomy.
4.0,Love these. It's definately good value for a good price.
4.0,"Crossover is gorgeous and while magnetic closure is strong, I wish this bag had a zipper to give me slightly more security and peace of mind. I find myself periodically checking to ensure it's closed."
4.0,"Looks good on. Works well when you want something feminine, but not dressy."
4.0,"I got these for my 3 and 7 yr old. I love to match them and I love this style of dress! It's very cute but beware, there will be ironing to do and I hate ironing! The material is thin and lightweight but not see through. My girls like the dresses and they look so cute in them, I just hate how wrinkled it gets even after wearing them!"
4.0,"Okay, first let me say this is super cute and i will probably order more in the future. However I ordered size 0-3 months and the leggings and hat are huge!! The shirt looks about right, but the other two are big for the size I ordered. The look more like a 6-9 months size. I hope I have a bigger baby that will be able to wear the whole outfit together since that is the point to it. Overall, it's cute just a bit big."
4.0,My sister liked it.
4.0,I think the post should be longer
4.0,"I got lots of compliments on this suit.  I have a very long torso and I am not sure if that was part of the problem or not, but I would not buy this if you have a larger chest.  There just doesn't seem to be much room up top.  Fits very comfortably though."
4.0,Just know this is see thru and runs small. Its cute on but don't know how practical it is for every day wear as it's see thru.
4.0,Really cute set.  Not too heavy but good for cool fall mornings .  Plenty of room to fit over heavy or bulky pajamas.<br />The matching robe for her doll is an added bonus.
4.0,I'm almost 3wks with them on and no irritation. I like them💎
4.0,"Since these are over-sized they are very noticeable and cute, also fit nicely."
4.0,Fits good and look more than the price.
4.0,Good product quality. I’m 5’8” and weigh about 150 lbs. The size small goes down to my knees. Not so bad just wish it was about an inch shorter.
4.0,Slips on my foot but couldn’t use smaller size
4.0,gift don't know
4.0,Well made. Fit as expected.  Haven't washed it yet but hopefully it will hold up.
4.0,"Soooooo beautiful. What the pictures do not show you though, is that the elephant is only 1 sided. The back is full of ugly holes. Other than that i love it."
4.0,I bought these for my 2 year old and the fingers are about an inch too long but easily sewed and fixed!
4.0,Husband loved it. I don't think I got the size that I ordered but I think I can make it work.
4.0,The whole set with 10 pairs of earrings  is affordable and fashion.
4.0,"Charts are not accurate. I am 42"" bust. Ordered xxl.  I should have ordered a xl or maybe L. It is difficult if I don't have an accurate chart."
4.0,Kinda small but worked to make it look like a phantom of the opera type mask!!
4.0,Fit is fairly tight. A little baggy on the foot part like other reviews stated but not uncomfortable when I have shoes on. Like them.
4.0,I didn't give it the full 5 star rating because the shirt pictured at the time of purchase had what looked like gold colored stiching down the front of the shirt. The shirt I received did not.
4.0,"a little hard to tell where the little bumps are in the band for adjusting, the adjustment door and latching rod on mine are bent upward slightly which prevents the clasp from latching flush, it latches and locks just fine, but this is a minor issue that i haven't had with other mesh watch bands in the past. Sometimes the hook part of the clasp sticks to the clasp itself and its hard to put on to the latching rod and requires that you start all over again when trying to put on the watch"
4.0,"This is made from a soft, smooth and silk-like fabric.  The ear loops help it stay in place.  It felt a little tight on my ears at first, but with some adjustments (pulling it up higher around my head), I got it to fit better.  It's a comfortable fabric and fit and seems like it should do the job."
4.0,This dress is very comfortable and very flowy. It’s a bit on the bigger side but I liked that it was loose fitting. The white portion of the dress was a little see through.
4.0,THE COAT IS BEAUTIFUL.  AND IT LOOK BEAUTIFUL OWN ME.
4.0,Loving this strap on my Orient Ray 2! The rubber is supple yet sturdy. It adds heft to my watch and makes it feel more tooly. It has an unpleasant rubbery odor but I'm guessing that will go away with time.
4.0,Glass worked very well for the price.  They helped driving to produce a clear and bight view.  Used at dusk to help reduce glare.
4.0,very comfortable and no fogging!
4.0,"Kids have warn these a few times and I'm really happy with what I see so far. Keeps them warm and it's soft, stretchy...which is what my daughter likes.  Very happy about the fit, when I buy overseas clothes they tend to be too tight and too small for American kids but these guys have done a good job putting that into consideration. I ordered a size 6-7 but when I received the pants, they were labeled XXL. So again they adjusted the sizes too fit western kids. They fit as expected!!  Some strings were still hanging loose on the back but not a big deal at all. Hence 4 versus 5 stars."
4.0,Bought as a Christmas present for my wife. She liked them.
4.0,I like all except the clasp is a little awkward to attach to try glasses.
4.0,"the color is great and so is the fabric. The sizing is not too accurate. some of the top strings are loose, but the actual fabric is a tad small, there is some sideboob. the support is not too good. the elastic is not very strong. the bottoms are definitely cheeky, but sturdy and cute. All around, i am happy with the purchase and plan to wear it this summer, maybe with some improvements. :) I am about 5'6, 135 lbs, c cup, and i ordered a medium. not at all bad for pricing."
4.0,it was great price and nicer than I expected for it!
4.0,Color is darker than what was expected. The function of the band is nice. Good thickness to the band as well. It is hard to put on with one hand.
4.0,a nice halloween costume
4.0,"I got a medic alert bracelet, it was a horrid color, these bands are the same size and now I can be color-coordinated and safe everyday."
4.0,Nice looking vest.  Fits well and looks good on.
4.0,"These are great quality and perfect for working out, I knew the sizing would be a little small but it’s a little restrictive for bigger boobs."
4.0,Very nice. Stretchy and comfortable.
4.0,"Looks very cute on. Vibrant color and cute style--very 40's glamorous. I like the fabric as its easy to wash and hides flaws. I had the same knot problem as everyone else but wasn't a deal breaker. Quality isn't tip-top, but wasn't a surprise. Good for the few times a year I have a date or night out."
4.0,I’m just an avg size guy. And it fits me ok. But anyone just a bit lagger will never get it on
4.0,"This was a beautiful blouse, and especially for the price, it is recommended."
4.0,"Had a rubber smell initially but it went away. Love these bands.  They fit great, keep the heart rate lights from glowing at night and very comfortable. Only had them a week but love them so far. Easy to get Fitbit in and out. The only thing I wish it had was a real frame in there because I can’t charge it using the frame charger I bought. Still worth the price for these bands!"
4.0,"Fit as expected, my daughter likes them.  Comfortable and cute, it's still summer so she hasn't worn them except for around the house so I'm not sure how durable they are yet."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift, and my friend loves it.  The wallet is fun and stylish, but it also fits credit cards and dollars well.  Nothing falls out when the wallet is open.<br /><br />The wallet is thin, so it does not take up too much room in one's back pocket.  That is nice too.<br /><br />The wallet is not leather but instead a leatherette.  I think might be advertised incorrectly."
4.0,I like these the can be use for multiple things I use it to burp baby clean baby even as a small blanket!
4.0,Cute but was a little big for my 2 year old
4.0,Very sturdy belt !!!  Would recommend it for a dress belt
4.0,A little heavy for me. Pulls your earlobe down
4.0,So it's for my son's costume and we have already painted it. But for 8 bucks it's a great buy. It's not a hard mask but rubber and fits over your head.  You can see ok out of the mask and again the price it's a great deal. Looks just like the photos. Very detailed. Very happy buy.
4.0,"I followed the guide to choose a size for me, turned out it's too small!<br />Can I exchange it?"
4.0,"The cotton part of these boxers are really soft.  The elastic is a bit scratchier in comparison to other brands.  I would say these hold up against the competition, but I would not consider them a favorite.  They would not be my go-to pair."
4.0,Head piece is very nice but the tops of the horns were bent when I opened the package. I’ve tried to Google how to make them stiffer but no luck.
4.0,"I normally wear a 7.5 in rings and this would only fit my pinkie so I know it's a bit small. Other than that, it's beautiful and simple in its design, and had not left any ""green"" on my finger, even after me sweating andnforgrtting to take it off in the shower. So I'd say this ring holds up really well to everyday pressures. The design was a little smaller than anticipated but I feel that's what makes this ring so pretty. Would highly recommend as a gift or just for yourself. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,"For the price being what it is, you can't go wrong with these glasses. I received pretty much what I expected except that on the red model the lenses were barely tinted gold, not actually gold like described. Nevertheless I was satisfied with them."
4.0,Wish I have went up one size
4.0,The person was surprised for there birthday
4.0,"i wanted a button down, loose fitting shirt that could be worn with different jeans/casual pants, so decided to give this a try.  this is much roomier than i expected, but fits as pictured.  if you like this shirt, but prefer more fitted, i'd suggest going down one size.  it is subtly colorful & very comfortable."
4.0,"This dress would likely be flattering on so many body shapes. I thought it was cute when I tried it on, but I was totally sold on it when I had two people within 30 minutes ask if I’d lost weight!"
4.0,I love the shoes. Really good quality. They were too big on her feet so she didn't wear them long.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,Super cute! Perfect for Thanksgiving. True to size. The tag however says dry clean only. Not very practical.
4.0,"Fit well and are comfortable... wish they had white versions; alas, went to the Hanes for that, as it simplifies doing the laundry to have them all white."
4.0,I like it. It’s really soft inside and fits pretty true to size. I usually wear a medium to large in women’s. It’s a slimmer fit but not to tight for me and I ordered a large. I am 5’6 and 170lbs. It is a little snug in the arms but I can still push up the sleeves.
4.0,"Normally a size 12 or a 14 I ordered the 18 as others suggested to compensate for the gaping buttons. The skirt is a beautiful shade,  perfect for fall with nice metal buttons and actual pockets. Eventhough the skirt is technically a size too large, it would gap open if I had bought a 16.  The extra large size has allowed me to put in a quick invisible stitch the length of the skirt, leaving out just the top button section so I can just slip the skirt on. Since the skirt has belt loops, I'll just wear a belt to hide , and tightened the waist. The stretch the skirt has is key to its fit. Overall, im happy with the skirt,, but would not feel comfortable wearing it without having put in the stitch. Its something I often do to my buttoned up tops too to prevent gaps at the bust."
4.0,As described and most importantly does not itch like the knit Dickeys Sport Set of 4  which I purchased previously and found be unwearable
4.0,"I really do love this bracelet, it is comfortable and pretty. My only real complaint is that the stripes that you can see on the bands as decoration are just painted on and I thought maybe they would be another strand but that was not the case. It fits comfortable and has hoops to make it smaller or bigger as needed. The blue leather material is strong and appears in good condition. It arrived in a packaged envelope inside a smaller plastic bag, which I did like because I feel it doesn't allow the bracelet to get scratched up."
4.0,"Adorable and sexy, comfortable shoes... for my friend!!  I had to give them to her since they arrived and felt a whole size too small. The size 9 I ordered fit her size 8 great."
4.0,"My daughter was very Happy to wear these . Easy to put on, I specifically wanted the screw back, so my daughter wouldn't loose them . I recommend these ."
4.0,"Beautiful make up bag , very comfortable for make up and to be put it your everyday bag, the only problem is the zipper goes off track sometimes."
4.0,"Amazing band for people who don't have certain size wrists, but the edge will get stuck on every. Single. Piece. Of fabric. Don't use while sleeping and try not to touch your wrist to clothing, towels, blankets or literally any type of fabric. It will pull out strings and ruin a lot of stuff. Not to mention you will be stuck on things and spend time to untangle it from the band. Still a great band, but the QA testing probably never came through."
4.0,I wish there was an option for opaque or translucent. I would love to have all solid colors and all see through colors instead of black and white being the only solid colored ones. A translucent black would be gray and a translucent white would just be clear and I would love that so much.
4.0,Very pretty and flattering.  A classic look. It was just too short for me.  I'm 5'8&#34; and it was well above my ankles.
4.0,"Really liked this costume, well made for what it cost.  The necklace was broken, read a few reviews that this happened to them. It's pretty long, I just tied the pieced together.  The headband was a bit small, but I had ordered another one to use."
4.0,Very good product for the price. Got this for my daughter for Halloween and the only complaint she had was that it was a bit itchy (but she is picky with clothes so may not bother anyone else the way it did her). She still wears it even after Halloween and gets lots of compliments on it when she does.
4.0,They only thing I disliked about this product is when I washed it the rose feel off. So it was not affixed properly on the jacket. The adhesive didn't work.
4.0,Super cute larger however than i expected
4.0,This is the perfect length to wear with my leggings.  The material is indeed thin so keep that in mind.
4.0,It’s shorter than I thought but I overall like it! The material is kind of rough but honestly it’s worth for the price.
4.0,"Very nice tote bag. Looks more expensive than it is. Fake leather is very soft. Wish the straps were a little wider/thicker. Hopefully they hold up. For the price, you can't beat it!"
4.0,This dress fit as expected and was not see through like some of the posts said. It is a little tight in the bust area on me but overall I'm happy with the purchase.
4.0,Loved the suit but definitely runs small!
4.0,"I liked the filigree design, not overly big either. They are not solid however, they are hollowed out but would make a good gift for any age person. They come in a nice little bag with a wiping cloth to keep them shiny. Thumbs up!"
4.0,slightly snug across the bust but not too tight to keep it.
4.0,It was nice but thicker than I thought the material was a little different but I like it.
4.0,I totes recommend sizing DOWN! Im normally an XL and this cardigan ended up fitting my friend who is 2x-3x. She said she felt skinny for fitting in an XL 🤣<br />Anyways this cardigan is BEAUTIFUL and very well made! Definitely one of the highest quality sweaters I’ve ever gotten on amazon! Well sewn and everything! Its even all around no crooked stitchings anywhere!<br />Im sad to give it away but i couldn’t exchange since i received a free item— amazon doesn’t offer exchanges only returns 🥲🥲🥲.<br />Its exactly as pictured! Definitely buy it! The yellow one is beautiful! The thin color stripe is a light blue almost grey color ( honestly it can pass as a grey).<br />Thank you to the seller. Unfortunately they couldnt fix my issue with the exchange because this is thru amazons warehouse only.
4.0,"These is a pretty shining pair of shorts but in my opinion, too sexy to be worn out in the public. I got the small size and for those who are not too gifted at the backside like me, this short will reach a little below, just enough to cover your backside.The shorts is a little big on me but that is to be expected because my size. I only use this indoors especially during bedtime. If you are confident and comfortable enough to wear this out clubbing, in a costume party or together with your loved one then go ahead. This will keep your partner’s eyes on you the whole time you are together. You need to use a barely there underwear though so it wont be visible. The shorts are tight enough without making you feel uncomfortable and suffocating. They don’t ride up so there’s no need of tugging it back down and really hugs your curve perfectly. I am not sure if this can be machine wash so it is better to hand wash and lay out to dry this for the safety of the material. Thankfully, I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and fair review. My opinions are based on my experience and observations and with no influence from the outside source."
4.0,Nice socks. Sizing was accurate. A little pricey.
4.0,My daughter thinks they are comfortable. Does the job. I wish the elastic straps were more durable. They are already stretching out after 8 uses.
4.0,Nice looks expensive nice and thin not too hot love the color
4.0,Arrived quickly and as shown and described. Bought them for my daughter and she’s happy with them.
4.0,"I bought this for my 3 year old great niece. It is adorable. The material is thin, making it good for hot weather. Tends to wrinkle if you don't remove it from the dryer immediately but that's o.k. The cuteness factor is a 10+"
4.0,I love the color and the feel. The actual thong is a smidge far back but tolerable
4.0,The wraps came on time and they are super soft! I love the colors and the price.!
4.0,"Great band. Used to replace the stock band on my gear fit 2 when it broke. Doesn't quite work for smaller wrists (I'm 5'10&#34; / 150lbs) right out of the box, but a couple seconds of work made a fixation point that fits just fine. Double clips for the band retention are very nice as well, but could use some more ability to shift for those that do have to shorten the band so you don't have a huge tag end hanging off your wrist. Again, great band, would definitely buy again, just don't expect to have it fit perfectly out of the box if you're a smaller individual."
4.0,i thought the zia symbol was embroided it isn't
4.0,"Love this dress, but the top was a little on the large side. I’m a Size 8 bottom and 32DD on top. The material is light sand would work nicely for a summer dress. Worked great for my Lorraine McFly costume with a sweater over the top."
4.0,"I am on my feet all day in a hospital.  The compression rating is 20-30mmHg and this was supportive throughout the day.  After wearing them about 9hrs, the top of the back of my calf, almost behind my knee, was a little sore from the sock 'cutting in'.  I do not have large calves; I wear a size 6 shoe and ordered the XS/S size sock.  They did give a 'cooling' sensation and other than the soreness behind my knee, I would most likely wear these more than the other compression socks I have tried.  I love that they are offered in pink!<br />update: i have washed and dried these in the dryer.  they fit comfortably and the back of the knee/calf pain isn't very noticable at all...it's actually worse on the red lion brand sport compression socks."
4.0,Fit good but I thought they had a built in bra
4.0,Very cool and fits great
4.0,"It was a hit as a gag gift for a snake lover.  However, the price is too high for the quality.  It looks like it was made by a child.  I was between 3-4 stars because it was funny and served our purpose but if you are at all crafty, you could make it much cheaper.  Would most likely not buy again but I am sure it would be fun for a child which is what it’s actually designed for."
4.0,I truly wish the fabric had a little give. Otherwise it really nice. My advice - order up a size and go for it.
4.0,This top is a little tighter than I wanted. I got it in an XL because that’s usually what I wear but it’s just tighter than I want. But it is motivating me to lose more weight to fit into it because I love this tank! Huge The Office fan!
4.0,Quite elegant. Haven't worn it yet.
4.0,"Nice dress, good material. A bit too stretchy, I was about 6 months pregnant and it was still loose around my belly."
4.0,It's thinner and bigger than I expected
4.0,"I wanted to use one for a cell phone strap. The cell strings are great. Nice that they can quick release. Trouble is the hook cannot come off the straps ring so it ticks against the phone as I walk along. Such an annoying noise.<br />However, these are extremely comfortable straps. No scratching, but holds well without too much slip.<br />Overall, I would recommend."
4.0,I'm overall satisfied with these (keep in my mind I'm not at all a cyclist). I wear a 10.5 in running shoes so I tried figuring out a comparable size in European men's and came up with a size 42. I'd say it's about half size too small but it doesn't me too much to Cycle the short distances I need for triathlons
4.0,The earings are a bit clunky - the setting seems to be a little bit bigger than need be and sticks out. But the earing is well made.
4.0,"La pijama muy bonita, solo vi unos pequeños detalles en la costura que no fueron bien terminados pero en general es un buen producto"
4.0,I love how the color is so pretty and vibrate. I also love the number of pockets it has although the material is a bit easy to wear-out it still does the job of keeping all your stuff in place.
4.0,"Shorts are a tad longer than I would have liked but overall cute set. Medium fit great, 5’7” 125lbs"
4.0,A lot of different colors. Easy to remove and place. Great price!
4.0,Really like the print and fit but only gripe is I need to keep helmet looking down and eyes all the way up to see and use the sun shades.... wish it had a larger shade and more travel because if I have head at normal level I’m looking straight out under the shade.
4.0,I like this better than I thought I would. I was just looking for something to lounge around the house in.
4.0,"Very nice Purse and roomy, Would like a snap or tie to keep closed."
4.0,"Nice, however the cup size is small as compared to other brands of the same size<br />The C is equal to a B"
4.0,I gave it 4 stars for the ingenuity. However it is a bit bulky for my gas cap and I forgot it everytime when it was in my door pocket
4.0,"It's perfect dress for the winter, fits snugly with room to move in. Heavy material makes it perfect to wear during the cold days."
4.0,good protection works well.<br /><br />scratches ez
4.0,This is a beautiful dress. A little thin but would be perfect in hot summer days or nights. fits as described. It is a true mini. I am 6 ft and had to be careful if it is windy! But beautiful dress.
4.0,"cute, good price"
4.0,"This is fun seasonal sweat shirt. I am a size 10 and the large fit well. It’s a thinner fabric, so you will need to layer it if you want to stay warm."
4.0,Takes some muscle to get them on but well worth the effort.  They are comfortable and stay up!
4.0,"Lovely hat!  Would like to order more once they are back in stock!  My only issue was one loop for the chin strap was not stitched correctly and wouldn't hold the hook on one side.  We have a farm in TX and this hat is perfect for farm and yard work, but stylish enough to wear out."
4.0,My 7 year old loves it & it fits him well.
4.0,The piece is exactly what I wanted but your can see through it when holding it up to light. When your wearing it ? Its really not see through just don't wear black under black wear nude color undergarments. Its also very low cut. I wore a bandeau under it
4.0,My 3 year old neice loved these. She had the most fun  putting them all over her face and arms.
4.0,"These leggings are no doubt soft, comfortable, high waisted and have great pockets.  However, they are not for hardcore cardio days/workouts for me.  They don't seem to compress as much as claimed.  I'm a true size medium and think I would have been better off ordering a small, maybe that's why the compression for me is a bit lacking.  I will continue to use these for yoga and on strength/lifting days, as they are not see through and I can squat without flashing my undies!  The 3 pairs I purchased were black, grey and navy.  They also seem to be holding up well with multiple washes."
4.0,Super comfortable!  True to size!  However if you have a somewhat wider foot; these would be a littler tight on for your first wear.  You will definitely need to break them in to get comfortable with the width.  Not completely disappointed.  They are somewhat stiff so I'm hoping they'll stretch out with continued wear.
4.0,the chain has a quality feel to it and the appearance is as advertised. made a great teacher gift.
4.0,Is to big for my daughter
4.0,Great summer layering option! The photos do not do it justice. Super cute and can be used in a ton of different styling ways.
4.0,The gloves fit well and are pliable for use as a driving glove. My only issue is the finger length. each finger is a quarter to half inch to long. I couldn't do a smaller size as they would be to tight. the gloves stitching seems well done and should last.
4.0,I love this dress.  I will buy more for this company
4.0,My girlfriend love them!!!!
4.0,The earrings themselves are good for the money. The packaging is not impressive. It doesn’t say 14kt gold anywhere or diamond ct. disappointing.
4.0,I love this necklace. It was a little smaller than i expected but still very nice.
4.0,"Bought this for my fiancée as a surprise. She had been looking for dresses and this popped up in my some article on fb that said it was the best reviewed dress on Amazon. It was pretty cheap so I thought why not, worth a shot. She loves it!  She says it fits great and is very comfy. It is a light material and it has pockets. It looks great on her too."
4.0,"pretty dress, has a fish tail on the back. just too big. with 4 inch heels dress was still dragging in the back. great for a wedding reception if you are part of the wedding. can dress up nicely with jewellry"
4.0,Purchase next size up they run small but otherwise I like them.
4.0,It looks just like the image but was a little bit larger than I expected. Packaged very well.
4.0,Comfortable and flattering leotard. I am a 5'6 women at 138 lbs and this leotard fits very nicely.  It is lined in the front.  It covers my bottom.  I have a well-developed back side and another leotard brand I tried showed too much cheek.  I feel like this brand gets a women's body.  The lace is pretty and the cut of the fabric is flattering to my shoulders.  I gave this leotard 4 stars because the clasp can sometimes be a pain in the derriere to close.
4.0,It fits my pandora bracelet perfectly !thanks for the memory!
4.0,"Cute style, really cheaply made and sized for a non anerican body but what do you expect for $5.00?  I bought the size L in 3 different colors and they came up to the middle of my waist.  After contacting the seller, they actually just refunded by money with no questions asked. Did even ask me to return it."
4.0,"I was going to buy the green dial version at first but changed my mind to the white face dial at the last minute. Seems very well made and the perpetual calendar setting was very quick and easy to set. Nice automatic for the price! Only 21.6k VPH vs. 28.8k so not as smooth of a second hand movement as could be but great value compared to a swiss made automatic running at 28.8k VOH.  Easy to adjust, good casing, comfortable to wear and movement is working great so far. Nothing to complain about at all."
4.0,The pajamas are good warm quality and my child loves them. I liked how they came with matching socks too. Only negative was they were a little over priced. I still purchased because I knew he would love them.
4.0,Fit really large
4.0,Very cute dress!!  The slip is a little bit too long underneath but not so off as to reject it.  Daughter loves it!
4.0,Good idea for Halloween
4.0,They are so comfortable! I wear them to work on Fridays.  Just like wearing pajamas!
4.0,Fits off the shoulder more than the picture shows!
4.0,The skirt was a good value for the price.
4.0,They were purchased for a college student residing in a dorm.  She only needs them for shower
4.0,"I got this for my 4 year old as a gift upon the arrival of our new baby. It is too large for her and doesn't adjust, but it's a sweet bracelet she can grow into."
4.0,This is a very casual dress. It’s quite comfortable
4.0,"The clips  for ears don’t want to stay closed when attached to the ears. Also I would’ve preferred the tail to be a pin on, but all in all I like the product."
4.0,Chest and waist ok
4.0,Cardinals have special meaning to me and my cancer battle. Love the necklaces for some of my friends and family. I have yet to see one glow in the dark
4.0,Super cute glasses but mine came lopsided/uneven when I tried them on.
4.0,"Pro:<br />Exact fit.<br /><br />Con:<br />A bit pricey for what it is, and quantity included."
4.0,Perfect. Was a hit.
4.0,For my height it was to long but I love it.
4.0,"Pants are adorable. They fit a bit larger than expected, but they’re super cute."
4.0,It's beautiful!! As for the size..I followed your chart and since I'm a size large 14..I went up two extra and this fit perfect!
4.0,"It's a good!  Sleeves are a little long, but the price is right."
4.0,Kinda small for a mans watch
4.0,"Fits my i phone 8 really well and I like what its made of, it makes it easy to hold."
4.0,"These glasses look exactly as advertised, but what really surprised me was the difference between their look and the way they feel.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The glasses came in a small drawstring bag for added protection and they were in good shape when I received them. I simply cleaned them with a mild cleanser and they were good to wear.<br /><br />LOOK:<br />They looked really good on me: Not too big, not too small. They also kind of look like the glasses a friend of mine once bought from H & M. To see if they were in fact unisex glasses, I let my brother try them on and they did not look feminine on him.<br /><br />FEEL:<br />They did feel kind of cheap, but as advertised, the frame and lens are indeed made of plastic. This only affected my opinion of the glasses slightly as most glasses are made like this.<br /><br />Overall, these glasses are very cool looking and would be perfect to wear at festivals, concerts, or even occasional summer wear.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discounted price or free for evaluation purposes in return for my unbiased review, which I have provided here. I do not have a relationship with the seller or company, and have not been compensated for my review. The opinions stated here are my own and based on my personal use/opinion of the product."
4.0,I like this item for Halloween I would recommend this to my sister family and to my young persons out there
4.0,I love them but they're a little tight but that's only because I have wide feet.
4.0,I’m 5’3” and the dress was long BUT I bought this dress to take engagement photos in the desert so it actually worked out. The lace adds a nice romantic touch and it’s flowy. One drawback is the tassels fell off the “belt” literally after my first wear of the dress.
4.0,"Good dress for the price. Nice fit, good material. However not true to color as some reviews say. I ordered jade expecting it to be somewhat more on the green side but it was like a neon turquoise blue... tried to get a pic true to color but i cant really get an accurate one. Take my word for it its neon turqoise blue. i will be returning this dress and getting it in black. Btw i am 5'6'' 133 lbs 32d 28 waist 39.5 hips. I got a size small"
4.0,I love it .. but my employer didn't...
4.0,It was smaller than I thought but was cute
4.0,Very ornate and pretty ring.  Unfortunately I ordered wrong size.  It was too loose.  I will reorder in my proper size.
4.0,Looks just like the picture very cute the pants were just a little off in sizing almost short and a little big but made the outfit work still looked cute
4.0,"A face mask. At 1st it wassup good, but the Velcro straps gave headache"
4.0,"It is a bit tight in the band, but it works.  I wish the hat breathed a bit more, as it gives me absolutely terrible hat-head, but I didn't expect anything different given it was 100% Polyester. I appreciate being able to keep this rolled up in my purse for those times I need a hat, but did not plan appropriately."
4.0,Nice for and material. We see how long it will last. The only concern I have is that the legs getting a little loose
4.0,Old school cute!
4.0,"Pensé que eran más cómodas, pero son un poco duras de la plantilla el material no se siente de calidad.."
4.0,GREAT BAG
4.0,"The shirt was exactly what I was looking for. Thin, breathable, with large arm holes. But the white color is see-through. A bra is completely visible. I am returning and getting a different color."
4.0,I really like this shirt as the feel is soft and comfortable. What I didn't like was that it shed a little from the inside and took several washes before I didn't see any more of what I believe were cotton balls on my bra. :)
4.0,Way too long and dumpy looking on me. I am 5 foot three and weigh 160 pounds and bought the large. The top part does have a snap but it still gapes open too much. Returning.
4.0,"They stay on my daughter's feeet for the most part, and are nice and soft.  Cute, too."
4.0,"It was perfect for its purpose, Diner en Blanc."
4.0,It is large and sturdy.  You can fit many bags inside of it.
4.0,It's a little confusing to use and doesn't work perfectly but it stays in place so that I'm able to wear my 30 band bra as a 28 bra.
4.0,"I originally bought this dress to wear to a funeral. It arrived minutes before I was supposed to leave for the ceremony. I'm so happy that it did. I got lots of complements on it. I really like this dress. But I expected the attached yellow part to at least look like a jacket with flaps on it. But no, it was like someone added the blue (not black like I thought) material with the flowers to the edge of a jacket to create a dress. The belt was much too small. For the price, and the need it did the job. But tall ladies...be warned, it was a few inches above the knee."
4.0,Wash this before you wear it in cool hand wash cycle and line dry. Steam with a cool iron. This can be a dress fancy<br /> print blouse worn with a sleek fashionable pair of slacks. An alternative to a dress blouse is simply wearing the interesting color blocked satin like feeling blouse with a pair of denim  shorts. The colors are bright yet the silky feel of the blouse makes it fun to wear as a casual or dressy look. The pattern is colorful and bright with a zip of flair in the print of lined color blocked silky satin feel. A camisole makes the blouse flow and avoid static cling that will draw attention away from the unusual look of this awesome fitting fashionable blouse. What a surprise when I opened the package and found the bright colors and fashionable color block print was a bit different that what is was expecting. A great fit for all figures for certain. Adding a camisole under the blouse does the trick in making it a dressy colorful blouse. Fun to wear because it has a new and different colorful creative pattern and the fabric is light and sleek. QUALITY FABRIC  convinced me to wear this as a dressy blouse on a very cold dull wintery day. The colors popped and brightened my day.
4.0,Like this beanie a lot so far. Will review again after washing.
4.0,"I have just worn them once so far. They fit perfect and they are very warm, however l am not sure that the material they are made of may be strong enough to withstand heavy snow and rain"
4.0,"This bracelet is pretty cool.  I bought it for myself as I love the passage from scripture written inside it.  Overall it is of good quality.  The only issue is that the strings tend to loosen throughout the day and require constant adjustments, but it looks great on my wrist."
4.0,"Such a fun tank top!  The arm holes gap out a little oddly, but it wasn’t a deal breaker.  This is a fun summer tank.  Runs a little big. Great for swim cover up too."
4.0,my son wears these and they fit him well and keep everything compressed for workouts
4.0,Fits just right. Thinner fabric than expected. I don’t expect it to last for long.  But overall a cute dress.
4.0,Amazing material. Very soft and fresh. But the grey color almost matches the beige one.
4.0,I use these with my Trollbeads bracelet. They work really well and don't tarnish. They are a little chunky for my taste but i still use them.
4.0,"Really like the watch for my Husband,who has failing eyesight. Ink problem ---- band was too tight. Had to buy another band. Received on time, well packaged."
4.0,Comfortable and nice summer wear. Large is slightly loose for me which is just what I wanted. Love a dress with pockets.<br />4 stars because it’s not pure cotton jersey material.
4.0,I always collect things on my trips and I needed something to be the final touch on the outside of a glass container filled with things from my European trip so I tied this around the bottles neck and its the perfect finishing touch
4.0,Thin and moisture wicking.
4.0,"Impressive upon arrival.  Haven’t worn outdoors yet but I really like these already. Rustic-soft leather feel & appearance upper, outside material.  Bottom rubber sole & plush inside lining seem slightly thicker than in pic which is good.  They fit perfect with half-calf sport sox though I may have purchased a half size up.  Bottom sole feels like a real rubber/non-slip texture for outdoor conditions.  Sole is far better quality & texture than I had expected.  I bought a different product before this that was described as a snow shoe but the sole is slick/smooth & I couldn’t trust that pair in snow/ice or hiking-type conditions.  This pair is not for extreme snow conditions but a perfect casual looking shoe that should get you through rain, thin snow or icy and really cold temps.  The plush lining is really nice!  These are for my son traveling to the Midwest in January.  I’m hopeful they have quality stitching and will hold up over a reasonable amount of time.  I was really impressed when they arrived & very acceptable by my very selective son."
4.0,Goof value.
4.0,The dress is adorable but tight in the bust. Other than that loved it. Nice material.
4.0,Was shipped fast and arrived like it said! Logos are clean amd look good. Size when ordering needs to be a little more clear....i ordered large but it came as a xl and fits a little loose but it works.
4.0,After getting the wrong charm when I ordered from another company. I was very happy when this one arrived! It's a bit larger than I anticipated. Overall I was satisfied and it's a great addition to my bracelet!
4.0,Fabric was a little bit thin.  But it's a nice addition to the wardrobe.
4.0,"This dress is cute but it is too short for the office.  I ordered size M, I'm 5.7, 140 lb.  It fits alright but the dress comes up few inches above the knee not like the picture.  I guess the model on the picture is not very tall."
4.0,What I wanted. Fits well. Warm. 4 stars cuz the pjs aren't the cutest....
4.0,"The watch band was difficult to install on my watch, and got stuck midway. I had to return it."
4.0,Very cute just enough bling
4.0,Very comfortable boots but not for wet areas.
4.0,Sharp jacket; so far so good.  Read reviews about zipper issues; I have been careful with mine and haven’t had any issues.  The zipper does work rather stiffly so I have been gentle with it.
4.0,"The t shirt and these pants go sooo good together, i also had to wear the latex undies also, let me tell you boy! I felt as if those sexy boys were lookin at my package, 😉.😗"
4.0,GOOD WATCH BUT IS MORE ADULT SIZE
4.0,"These are an Asian product with the expected smaller Asian sizing, so adjust accordingly.  I'm 5'3, 170, 36DD with about a 34 waist, 41 hip and the X-Large fits the way I like (a little loose). For reference, I usually purchase a Large in other brands, and can wear some Mediums. The top fits me well, but it would be too short for a tall person.  However, the pants are about 4"" too long!  The top is constructed for a short, boxy, busty woman, while the pants are made for a tall, skinny person! haha.  The waistband is really small on the pants, but it is elastic, so it stretches and isn't too uncomfortable.  The top could also use another button at the top, as it does gap open/low cut. Nice color (I got the green), and the material is soft/feels nice.  For the price, these jammies will do just fine."
4.0,runs kind of small
4.0,"Its a great bag. The detail and design is just as depicted. I would give 5 stars if not for the smell. I get it was sealed and wrapped in packing which would help the smell linger initially, but I left it outside for 2 days and the smell is still more than noticeable. Otherwise, terrific spring bag."
4.0,"Good.,,"
4.0,They were really cute and I wore them a lot but they were a little big for my wrist but still really cute
4.0,It fit on top but was too small around the waistr & hip area.
4.0,"Good bag overall. Nice color, the straps are a bit longer, and the half-circle cut out make it comfortable to wear on your shoulder. The insides are a bit cheap and some of the lining is threading. I wish the bag was a bit deeper. I use it for school sometimes and I cannot zip it close with folders or papers in it."
4.0,Love how many you get cuz let's be honest about how many you'll lose! Only downfall is they are a little small my 3yr old doesn't have fat fingers but your basic baby squish and they are super tight. Can only fit pinky and ring finger barely.
4.0,"This shirt was shorter than I like.  It barely covered the top of my jeans.  It fit everywhere else,  just off on length."
4.0,Very comfy. Run  slight bigger then size. No elastic in waist and thick  cord to tie so have to re tie them every so often.  Everyone loves the look though.
4.0,"What a good looking watch! Very pleased with the shipping box and presentation. Wood is a beautiful dark brown and the face is simple and clean. I was expecting it to be a little heavier, but all in all very pleased with the purchase. Thank you So Flow"
4.0,Convenient for travel
4.0,"The dress is slinky, long and elegant. It fits as expected for me, but I found the placement of the slit a little odd. With some nice jewelry and high heel shoes, its a perfect match for an evening out, to dinner or an upscale party. I found it comfortable to wear; no annoying things sticking out. Overall I like the dress, but will have select times of wearing it."
4.0,somewhat small but still a good look
4.0,I absolutely love this necklace.  A Good purchase!!!!! Didn't last long.
4.0,Fit perfectly and good thickness
4.0,Cuff links are very cool and add style. These look good on.
4.0,It was delivered to the wrong house but I do have to say it looks great on my neighbor.
4.0,"Hooks very flimsy made of thin metal, sort of unusual straps  in back not as attractive as front but the front is cute and different so complements plenty,"
4.0,Pretty dress however it does not flare out at the bottom as pictured.
4.0,I like it because it was handmade
4.0,"Really nice for the price, but the cup size is smaller, probably best for a C cup or under."
4.0,"Love this dress! It’s super comfy, but the top is more like a swim suit material and it was a little too big. The bottom is very soft!"
4.0,"The product is a shoe shine buffing cloth, yet the questions are about the fit of shoes, etc."
4.0,"They are so cute, but I wear a size 10W shoe and they sent me a S/M.  Sorry but they are coming back."
4.0,"WOW, amazing stretchy thick fabric. But only gave 4 stars since the zipper is really hard to pull up and had some extra fabric that got stuck in zipper before I trimmed it. This dress is form fitting but has lots of stretch to it, so comfortable to wear. I am 5'3&#34; and about 145lbs with a little left over baby belly so had to get spanx to suck in belly since that part of the dress shows all!  I bought a size large which was perfect and came just below my knees. Neckline was great, showed enough cleavage to be sexy , but not falling out. I am a size 36C and maybe larger busted women might have trouble squeezing the girls in a large, but again dress is very thick and stretchy fabric. Love this dress.... but better if I could get rid of baby belly!"
4.0,"Quality real leather hard case fits larger sunglasses just great (I use it to store prescription Maui Jim Voyager, with 60mm lenses) with nice lense friendly scratch free lining. A bit ackward storing and removing glasses from the case, as the leather strap threaded through a metal escutcheon latch makes it near impossible to remove or store glasses with one hand, so not practical for everyday stop and go driving. Great for general protection in a briefcase, purse or suitcase. Nicest leather case for eye or sunglasses I've found (and I've searched), despite the somewhat inconvenient (yet very secure) latching mechanism."
4.0,Arrived in great condition! I like the bright colors. The band itself is very comfortable and helps prevent sweat from getting into my eyes.
4.0,Very pretty dress but it is a little large. I ordered a small and it fits a little more like a medium but no problem since I wear it to work anyways!
4.0,Love this dress. Wore it for my rehearsal dinner. Only complaint is that it is very short!!
4.0,"The fit for me is good,. but there seems to be a slight haze when in direct sun."
4.0,"The button holes are a little tight and take some time to work with but the buttons will go through. I am a size 0-2 normally so I got the small and it does ride up a tad bit but not terribly. overall, for the price it is a great product."
4.0,a little cheaper material then what I was picturing. Is still cute
4.0,This is a well made necklace and bracelet set! It is stamped 925 silver - so! We shall see how it holds up! I hope 🤞🏼 bc I happen to really like this set!!
4.0,It looks great on my son.  He likes to workout and shows off his muscles.
4.0,Great product and it looked wonderful. It was a little hard to see out of and I was hoping the air pump was a little more powerful. But otherwise a pretty cool costume.
4.0,Great product. Bought for my boyfriend on Christmas and he wears them everyday! Great buy.
4.0,very cute wish it was longer
4.0,fits well and once broken in will be more comfortable
4.0,This robe is very comfortable and light weight for warmer weather.  It is so slippery that the belt slides undone and therefore isn't always dependable coverage.  I just ended up sewing part of the front together and slip it on over my head.  Now I love it!  Very pretty fabric and definitely worth the price.
4.0,length is perfect
4.0,For price this is really good deal. Ivery washed it numerous times and it didn't change color.  I am 125p 5'2 and I ordered size 5 (25) it fits fine.
4.0,Love this product and it is a gymshark dupe but it does run small but this is a perfect shirt for anyone xs-m just size up.
4.0,Belt came quickly and fits. Not like the other one I ordered from  different vendor.  Worn twice. So far so good. We will see how it holds up.
4.0,"I must say before I begin this review: I was extremely ambivalent as to whether this watch is a 3 or 4 star product.<br /><br />  As soon as I received this watch, I immediately thought it was too small, which may or may not be a good thing depending on you. I've been using my brother's G-Shock for quite a while now, and it's uncomfortable (despite all of the hype) and way too bulky! So, because of how this picture depicted the size (where the batteries go), I bought this watch. Also, the G-Shock and many other expensive watches have many designs at the sides of the back as opposed to this watch's straight round design, which makes it ergonomic. In addition, this watch is REALLY light, which again, can be good or bad. But here comes my major gripe. This watch's lighting aspect is so bad that I wouldn't even wear it if I got paid $15 to (which funnily is what happened because when I tried to refund it, Amazon politely accepted my refund AND surprised me by saying I can keep the watch too)!<br /><br />The light:<br />  First of all, the button for the light on this watch is so tiny which may make it hard to find for some people and also to push. But if you do manage to push the button, the light only stays on as long as you push it, and to completely kill the entire glory of the watch, the light is horrendous! I was so disappointed. Seriously, this light is so bad and only barely covers the left side of the watch. What was Casio thinking?!<br /><br />I would also like to add that the design of this watch is so simple and kind of boring, but once again...it's so comfortable as opposed to other bulky watches! And because of the thinness, it's much easier to slide on tight men (or women's) clothing such as dress shirts, etc. I would recommend this watch if you are willing to ignore the poorly-designed lighting portion and the ordinary look.<br /><br />*Unrelated*<br />After analyzing carefully a few other inexpensive watches, I came across Casio Men's W735H-1AVCF Super Illuminator Black Watch. This watch seems really good but also uncomfortable due to the similar strap design of the G-Shock. But what makes elevated it is the huge ""Light"" button, which I find very important and the extremely useful vibrating alarm since I am a very forgetful person, and sometimes I may be listening to something and won't hear my watch's alarm.<br /><br />Also, Casio Men's WV58A-1AVCR Waveceptor Atomic Digital Watch:<br />Has a similar designed strap (comfortable), which, as mentioned before, is what makes the Casio F91W-1 Classic Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch good! It also has EL lighting, which is far superior to LED lighting I think. Furthermore, the button for the light is medium-sized and is at the right side of the watch, which is so-so (i.e. workable).<br /><br />With a picky and frugal personality like mine, it's extremely difficult to find a perfect, inexpensive watch ($15-$25)."
4.0,"I found the hat to fit a little small, but with a bit of stretching, we were in business. The speakers are a little bulky and press against your ears loosely, but that also allows for you to hear your music and some of your surroundings. there is a little bit adjusting that you do to the speakers. Connecting your hat to your Bluetooth device may take a little time, but it will pair. Overall, it is a great item to conceal the fact that you are listening to music, but also know that people will still attempt to talk to you because they do not realize that you are listening to music."
4.0,I got this super cheap and for the price it's a nice scarf.  I wish it was longer so I can do all the fancy scarf knots.  It's a thin lightweight fabric.  Matches a lot.
4.0,"Very nice earrings, inexpensive looks really."
4.0,I like it but it is a tad small and certainly short. I would size up for sure.
4.0,"I thought the shirt was well made, attractive, and comfortable to wear.  I did find it ran a bit small compared to others of similar size.  Definitely Juniors, not ladies sizing.  Just a bit tight under the arms.  Other than that, I really like it."
4.0,Love the pattern and it was big enough just find it a bit stiff
4.0,"Okay, so this was a gag gift for my toddler son.  He hasn't gotten much use out of it yet.  It's Disney though, and we certainly love the Big D.  It's your basic hat with standard quality and construction.  Should last.  Price was right."
4.0,Hardly notice its in my pocket.
4.0,It is nice for the price but I only got 4 pieces. No ring was received
4.0,They look exactly how the picture shows. They won't go as high as they do on the manican. But they will go over my knees. I am 5'4. And curveyish. :)
4.0,The rose gold ones are really cute.  I think they're the perfect size.  Side note: The edges are SO sharp they could double as a self defense weapon. Just use these bad boys to slash an attacker!!  Even the end of the part that goes through your ear is sharp!!!  If you need your ears pierced just poke these through your lobe! Voila!! If your man needs to shave his face... Turn one of these on its side and shave away!! Multi-use product.  One star removed for potential death by sliced jugular.
4.0,"Enough capacity without being overly large. Stylish, but not overly so for a man. The only suggestion would be a mid- flap for additional identification card holder."
4.0,My grand daughter loved them cuz they were fitting.
4.0,Loves the sweatshirt itself but sizing was way small! Sized up and still too short
4.0,"This dress is beautiful, but it is way too long for me. I am 5’2” and there is about 4 inches of material laying on the ground. And that is with sandals that have a small 1 inch platform. The material is not too thick, but also not thin or see through. I am a size 10, 36G, and a large fit me perfectly. It could easily be cut and hemmed, but I’m just going to return the item."
4.0,"Nice set, a little heavy for me so definitelynot for everyday use."
4.0,I get lots of compliments on this dress. But the blue isn’t as dark as advertised
4.0,Fabric part lasted a long time. I've had it for the better part of a year. The clip at the end is cheap though and has chipped significantly. The clip has also been weakened over time.
4.0,"I got this hat for my son, mostly for hiking and mushroom foraging. He likes it, and it seems pretty well-made. It's maybe not the most breathable, from what he says- hiking in low to mid 80's temperatures, he sometimes complains about it being too hot. It took a while to get here, also, but that was in line with the expectation they set."
4.0,Bonito reloj de buena calidad; trae buenos recuerdos este diseño.
4.0,"These Ukoly Ski Goggles,Snow Snowboard Goggles for Men Women Adult Youth Snowmobile are nice looking goggles. The band has a rubber zigzag on the inside that holds it in place. They are extremely small though. I have a small head and these just fit, so I wouldn't recommend them to someone who has a medium or larger size head. The box states it has a medium fit whatever that means. They would be good for teens or youths.  They come with a silky fabric bag for storage and a lens cloth. I'm not confident the foam will stay adhered to the goggles in the long term, but for the price they are worth it if they last one season."
4.0,My nephew wears it constantly but it could be alil bigger.
4.0,Bought my for my daughter. Fits her good
4.0,"One of the few dresses, I buy on Amazon that actually fit. The last dress I brought can fit someone who is a size 8, not a 24. I will review that dress next. This dress fits great and received plenty of compliments. Will buy more in different prints."
4.0,Shirt fit great except for the arms but this has always been an issue for me whether I was heavier or lighter. For reference I bought a L and my underbust is 34” while around my bust is 38 1/2”. Waist size is 33”.
4.0,"It looks like my dog in thw 60's. I miss him. He was a toy Fox Terrier. The runt of the batch that became a throwback. 1 out of 5,000. He was twice as large as his mom.D.M. Too bad there is no t shirt. Do not wear sweat shirts around here too warm. D.M."
4.0,My daughter wore this anklet during her wedding. It was the perfect touch. She was happy with the quality for the price.
4.0,It’s super cute. A little itchy but other than that no complaints. It pairs well with many things. Even someone with very little fashion sense could rock this and be cute.
4.0,"I ordered these in black and dark green.(the green is NOT dark green as specified,much to my disappointment). However, the fabric is soft, breathable and stretchy which is a plus!"
4.0,Ciclismo de ruta
4.0,Nice bag but the inner zippered pocket tore immediately so I had to sew it up but its a nice size and has alot of room.
4.0,"I don't wear ties, but my boyfriend does!! He doesn't wear formal clothes often, but he does go to Church with his family, and he has his fancy clothes that I will most likely never see him wear in person. So I thought something as simple as a tie could be a nice little gift. I wasn't too sure about it being skinny, but it turned out to be a decent size - he's a pretty tall guy, so I was worried it would look TOO skinny on him.<br /><br />We both thought that the cotton texture was soft and the length of it is superb. I think the design is fashionable and it brings out a new side of him - he only has black ties and a bright blue tie. He told me he likes it so far, but because he hasn't taken the opportunity to wear it a lot, we'll still have to discover how well it holds up!"
4.0,"Shirt runs large, I went by the size chart shown.<br />I normally wear a Large but went with an XL and the under part was super loose. Will need to return for smaller size. -Dont go by size chart-"
4.0,Gorgeous.. Only thing is that the bust may be slightly bigger than expected.
4.0,Watch looks good and keeps good time. Only draw back I have with the watch is that it is very thick and bumps into stuff when you wear it. I own another Benyar watch and the case is much thinner than this one.
4.0,"I enjoy the watch. Very affordable. I’m a medical assistant and use the watch because I don’t like to touch my phone while on the clock. Deducting one star because the light is barely visible. Other than that perfect, simple watch!"
4.0,"wasn't expecting much, but turned out to be really cool and i was surprised at the first glance in fact"
4.0,"This is a very warm and comfortable fleece. I would have given it 5 stars if I could get the collar to stay down, but I guess it only stays up. Also the wrists are tight elastic but not too tight."
4.0,"Would’ve given 5 stars, but the cuffs feel cheaply made and will probably break soon. Very comfortable!"
4.0,Good value. Now I can accessorize.<br />I knew there were three belts and one buckle. It only takes seconds to change them. If the little end clip comes off I can still wear the belt. It wouldn't hurt my feelings that bad.
4.0,"Pretty cute necklace, very blingy! Quality is ok for the price, I don't see any quality issues at all."
4.0,"Wish it were just a little bigger. The picture shows a lot of items, but everything is flat...it will not hold a lipstick tube and your cell phone together."
4.0,"I love this dress it is perfect for the hot Florida weather here. Very flowy and comfortable. I normally wear a 10, so I ordered the large at first. It was really boxy looking, so I returned it for the medium and it fits perfectly. Can be worn alone as a dress, and would probably be cute with leggings too."
4.0,Looks like shown
4.0,"Overall it is a great product, but has a few issues. First the elastic band keeps twisting up inside the material, so I have to manipulate it to straighten it out. Second they were much too big. Third they definitely don't keep you cool. After a T25 workout my legs were hot and uncomfortable. Other than that they are a nice buy"
4.0,"Very pretty, is a little lighter than I expected, but does the job with most of my pendants"
4.0,"So I really like these earrings, however I am deducting a star because it doesnt specifically say what the colors are (which by the pics should be fairly obvious, but its not) I assumed one of the 3 pair I received would have black tassels, but the only black in the set is on the multicolored pair. The other 2 are a dark blue (which I could kind of tell from the photo) and a dark green, which I assumed was actually black. A little bummed, but I will find something to wear them with."
4.0,Seems to be controlling my swelling-thx
4.0,These were cute. They fit me a little too big but served the purpose. I liked the variety in colors.
4.0,"I love the fit, material, and style! I would buy it in every color possible!! My only problem was the color was not the same blue as I expected.  It was more of a royal blue than baby blue."
4.0,"Well made and comfortable. Should please any man who wears this style of underwear.<br /><br />They did seem to shrink just a little after washing, so getting the next larger size might be a good idea."
4.0,"Well made, good finish inside and out, just fits a bit smaller than expected. Ordered a large, which is usually roomy but fits more like a T-shirt. She loves it though!"
4.0,I have several Henschel hats and they all fit perfect as a medium size. For some reason this one is almost to tight. The hat is great and is cooler than any hat I own for working in the garden and yard. Hopefully it will stretch just a little bit for more comfort. I know a large would be to big so I will live with it.
4.0,My husband really liked the hoodie on the shirt.
4.0,"Bought a size small for my 9 year old niece. She probably is a sz 12 in girls, normally. It was a good fit, because it does run small."
4.0,Was as excited
4.0,Costume fit Okay!
4.0,"I can be a size 8 or 10, depending on the clothes, but I am always a L or XL in swimsuits. 36C cup and a booty/hips. I got the XL in this floral swimsuit and while I thought it looked really cute from the back, I just didn't like the print as much in person. The colors are much brighter and more &#34;Hawaiian-shirt&#34;ish in person. Also cut into the love handles a little too much. Had to return."
4.0,Really baggie lose fit.  Material is thin not really good for cold weather.
4.0,She liked the feeling of this scarf
4.0,Smelled very much like chemicals when I first received it.
4.0,I love them. Just the right amount of comprssion.
4.0,I think they are children size. Beautiful colors.
4.0,"This blouse is really pretty, but sadly it did not fit me.  I read the reviews and ordered up a size and got a large.  I could not even get it over my shoulders!  I wear a size 8 US, so I am pretty surprised the large didn't fit and it's not like I am built like a swimmer!"
4.0,"The dress was pretty decent quality, but could have been better. The sizes run way too big."
4.0,Comfy and nice material.
4.0,"For 5 buck's I guess I can't complain too much, Lenses are good color  (as described) the plastic is a serious plastic. and the len's part is a little bit too big for my liking. But like I said for 5 buck's Not much to complain about. They do the job."
4.0,"Love the shirt, although the material is a little thinner than I would have liked. Kind of funny because people who know the movie smile and sometimes comment when they see it - everyone else just assumes it's an advertisement for a real auto parts store."
4.0,"Not the best quality, but it looks just like the pictures and photographed beautifully."
4.0,"Was a little tighter than expected, but had a decent amount of stretch. Overall it wasn’t a good style for me. But the material and stretch were nice."
4.0,"They range in size, some fit just right and some are way too small."
4.0,"Very cute, but huge! I typically wear a size S or M, and I think this would be perfect if it were just a bit smaller. Definitely recommend though!"
4.0,"These slipper socks are just what I was looking for, and the 4-color set comes packaged as separate pairs, so you can share them with your cold-footed friend.  The colors are vivid and seem color-fast in washing.  The material is very soft, but with a good no-slip tread added on the bottom, which is slightly perceptible when wearing on bare floors.<br /><br />I have two minor complaints, echoed in other reviews:<br />- The elastic is sewn a bit high on the foot, so I feel it too much at the top-front of my ankle.  It is not chafing, but I am definitely aware of it in a way that I wouldn't be if it went across only the top of my foot instead of the front of my ankle.<br />- As it is a chenille-type fabric, it does tend to drop puffy little balls of colored lint all over the place, especially when new.  I would advise caution if washing by machine with other lint-attracting items like towels.<br /><br />However, the material is soft and thick, so they keep my feet warm (and I also sometimes wear them inside boots), the colors are deep and pretty, and the price is good for the quality of the product."
4.0,Received item promptly and love the dress!
4.0,"This pair of boots fits nice, good price for this boots, also they're comfortable and the color is perfect. I love it"
4.0,wife says it's ok
4.0,nice but small than shown
4.0,It is a little yellower gold that my ring but it is hardly noticable. I just picked it up today so we will see how it goes with wear. Was going to arrive January 3rd estimate but it came today.
4.0,"Very thin for sure, but does look nice."
4.0,"I took a gamble on this and for less than $7 it's pretty cute!  The zipper is quite stiff and the sleeves are a tiny bit too short, but if you slouch the sleeves as shown in the product pic, that doesn't matter.  I usually wear a size small and for this purchase I got a medium."
4.0,"It puts on a light show every time you press the button to show the time.  It can be set to display the time automatically at 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes.  Works great.  My only problem is after having the band adjusted as small as I could it's still a little more loose than I like."
4.0,"Patty Boutik clothing always meets my expectations. Cute clothes. My only compliant is I wish it came in XS. I got a small, a little baggy in the midsection. Love that it's long. I'm 5'1 and 103lbs for reference."
4.0,This choker is substantial and sexy!
4.0,"My son wore this bonnet for six month photos and he looked so sweet. The photos turned out great, but I wish I had gotten it sooner to try to break it in. The bonnet came quite stiff so I washed it, but then it was super wrinkly and it was difficult to get the wrinkles out. My steamer didn't really work and my iron made it look kind of stiff again ha!"
4.0,"Is this thing cute? Hell to the yes!<br /><br />Does it fit true to size? Um... I'm not sure?<br /><br />I've literally worn this a few times and I still can't tell if it fits properly. It genuinely looks cute on me but I'm really confused on how I'm supposed to wear it.<br /><br />Why? The skirt is quite long and the top is quite short.<br /><br />So basically, I'm not sure if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted. It doesn't LOOK high-waisted but that's the only way you can get the affect seen in the photo. However it feels really awkward to wear it that way- like maybe it's supposed to be worn long.<br /><br />Then the shirt, while cute, is oddly short. Again, if you wear the skirt around your waist you'll end up showing your midriff, which is not really the look I'm going for.<br /><br />So- if you're fashion forward you might be able to make this work. If you're not great about style, you might have an issue."
4.0,Loved the fit and comfortable fit.
4.0,i only take off 1 star because it seemed itchy. I put a shirt under it so my daughters skin wouldn't get irritated.
4.0,Light and comfy... wish it had some stretch to it though
4.0,"Ordered XL and it's way to big for US size 14!<br />See true but very nice, comfortable and stretchy. My next step will be ordering size L."
4.0,I like the purse but the straps are a little short.
4.0,It is made with a very thin material.It is a summer garment.Love it! Received many compliments.
4.0,"I really loved it !! I’m debating on getting another because it broke but I’m not sure if it was because of me , I was watching a play at a theater and felt it come off and it was broken :( , wish I had a picture with it because it looked stunning 🔥"
4.0,"returned, not what i wanted"
4.0,It fit perfectly and keeps my daughter warm and comfortable.
4.0,Love this out fit
4.0,Good length but rolls down a bit when I play golf or softball.
4.0,Very comfortable.  Arrived fast.  Exactly as shown.  Might be five stars but I don't know yet.  I have to wear them in a bit to see if the strap lossens up a bit like my last pair.  It it does it is definitely a five star product.  By the way l love the arch support.
4.0,"This is really a nice dress. I am 5'4&#34; with a  29&#34; waist and a  34DD bust. I ordered the size M. The material is a nice weight, and the pattern is adorable. The straps on the dress are short, and if you are long waisted, this dress is not for you. I am very happy though with the look and the fit on my body type. I have worn it with an underskirt, and it was really cute!"
4.0,"My son loves these pants and really likes how soft the fabric is.  I’d say they’re average in quality, so I’m not counting on them lasting for too long.  But, the price is right and I’m not too worried about quality since my son is growing so fast!"
4.0,Espere fuera un poco más grande
4.0,"perfect for summer, But the size must be a size smaller than your size"
4.0,"It's so big. I'm a medium and I brought it one size up , because I was nervous that it would be too tight. I plan to get it fitted to my size, because it's absolutely beautiful. I want it to work before spring/summer hits."
4.0,"These are great. I have a wide face, so wanted a wide pair of glasses. These work fine."
4.0,The pendant is not too large or too small and has a good weight to it.  I'm wearing it as a necklace so the chain is a slight disappointment.  I put the pendant on a nicer chain that I already had.
4.0,It's a nice bracelet.  I like the stainless steel for everyday wear.
4.0,"Waaaay more comfy than expected. I can wear them all day. I love that each of the buckles are adjustable to give a great fit. They are also much lighter than they look which helps in them being easy to walk in.<br /><br />However, the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don’t think these will last more than a few seasons. I can see these falling apart after maybe next summer so I’m glad I got these on Amazon Prime day as I don’t think they are worth the full price. I don’t know what I stepped on but there are two gouges in the bottom already. Granted I’ve worn them no less than 10 times but still. I’ve never seen that happen to any of my 100+ shoe collection.<br /><br />Buy them if they go on sale."
4.0,Review for: NCCB Girls Sandals Cute Cherry Adjustable Velcro Sandals Open Toe Anti-skid Strappy Flat Sandals for Little Girls<br /><br />These are adorable sandals for little girls. They have a sole with traction to prevent slipping and a bit of foam in the foot bed but not much else for support. That makes them a cute shoe for an event but not to wear all day.<br /><br />I love that the they have a Velcro closure on the ankle rather than a buckle that is tedious to fasten. The cherry design on top is a nice pop of color and a pretty design.
4.0,Looks nice but the sleeves are shorter than expected. You may want to go with the next size up if you get one
4.0,"My husband actually picked out this dress. the price for the dress is GREAT!! I like the dress. look forward to steaming it to get the wrinkles out so i can wear it. the color looks great. drapes nicely on the body...I may take it to the tailor to get it taken in just a little, so it will have more definition for my body type. the sleeves i am not so sure about they just hang and its not really the type of sleeves to roll up (bc they fall right back down) or it takes away from the dress. the dress arrived exactly when they said it would, I was pleased with how fast it was delivered. I am conservative but like to look classy with a little flare and this dress meets my criteria. you can wear it spring, summer and falI, it flows nicely and is breezy. i have no issue with the fabric,except that right under the breast area you can see where the beige under-layer is sewn to be attached to the orange top layer. it may not be so pronounced after I steam it, we'll see. I may go back and purchase the olive colored dress. Its a great addition to the wardrobe."
4.0,"Not sure if I would order these again but they are reasonable quality for the price. Nose bridge is somewhat adjustable, but too stiff to wear comfortably. I planned on wearing them pushed up so that doesn’t matter. The strap is okay and is adjustable as well. Pretty solid 7/10 overall."
4.0,Very nice dress and the material is not too thin.
4.0,"Fantastic for the price.  However, wish it was a slightly darker shade of grey."
4.0,"It does protect the ears from sun and presumably from e snow  When the ear protectors are puled down, it gets a little frazzled along the seam.  Not a bad looking cap."
4.0,"This dress was nice, but a little smaller than expected, and even being a petite person the dress was too short. It came right above my ankles, but it's a nice dress overall"
4.0,The bracelets are nice I’ve recieved compliments and I absolutely don’t regret buying them. However i wish the gold leopard on my bracelets lasted a little longer. After about a weeks worth of wear it started to fade. (Did not turn my wrist green). Other than that they’re great accessories.
4.0,"Nicely made beanie, although the shape is a little more slouchy than I expected"
4.0,"love this, keeps head warm, great quality, excellent price"
4.0,Very soft and cute! Runs a bit big but not not huge. It snags easily though and is pretty thin.
4.0,"I was so nervous to order a suit online, but I tried it. I tried it on and loved it! It fits perfectly and was so comfortable! I can’t wait to wear it this summer!!!"
4.0,"Well made, very pretty.  Is a bit heavy so it's going to require some back up to keep it in place. Otherwise, very pleased"
4.0,Wonderful stylish earrings for a great price. All of them are wearable and pretty. I had trouble with one of the earring backs but I just replaced it. Will buy again from same seller
4.0,"When I received my package, there were no pins in the box, only the hat. I contacted the seller about this and the seller worked with me and was very kind.<br /><br />The hat itself is pretty good. Although it is a little soft and doesn't hold its shape very well, but since its not a super big hat to begin with, that may not be much of an issue."
4.0,It is cute and will get the job done.
4.0,"I only have a portable washer/spin-dryer, I thought it will stretch out after washing, but it did not. If you heat-dry it, I'm sure it will shrink a bit. I'm a Large, 42-44, the Large that I got is more like a Medium. Too late to return as I've already washed them. It's a tight fit but usable still."
4.0,Very cute two piece suit
4.0,Overall for the price I was not disappointed the pants are a little bit tight on me in the waist only (woman’s XL) but everything was good and everyone else didn’t seem to have an issue very cute and light weight!
4.0,Very cute and comfortable.  Quite a bit bigger than I was expecting and I'm a big girl.  😄. It will be my nightgown for when I gain those extra pounds.
4.0,Wish the magnet was stronger.  It seems weaker than my other ones.  I have several.
4.0,thinner material than expected.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e36e3d776a9d32a7dafe6347db0c0838]] The dress is absolutely stunning... even prettier in person BUT is very poorly made (on the inside) and the zíper almost didn't want to open/close.<br />I spent about 10+ minutes trying to zip it up and if you have a toddler you know how long those 10 minutes probable felt like.<br />Overall for me it was an awesome buy because it was something she was only gonna wear it once so for the price I paid it was a win situation.
4.0,"Very happy with the  swim suit , fit is great and comfort to wear<br />The boy type shorts just the right length . The top is slimming . THINK I WILL buy another"
4.0,The material is like dry fit. I had to return it because the medium was too big for my daughter. The jacket is baggy and the pants are like leggings...we will order a small. The colors are consistent with the pictures. Super cute...
4.0,Very inexpensive and great looking!!  I have sensitive ears they didn’t bother me at all. Love them!!
4.0,"Very comfortable and durable,  no breakdown when washed.  I have a small face and it fit ok, not too big as other masks have been."
4.0,It's good to use.
4.0,"fit is fine, but the back material is a little to thin"
4.0,"These were an inexpensive replacement for a pair of white sunglasses I broke.  Based on the price, my expectations weren't that high, but I really like these.for driving and wearing around town.  I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,Pretty as advertised
4.0,"Great bag. A little smaller than I had hoped, but perfect for a long weekend. Quality is better than I expected after reading reviews."
4.0,"The shirt was not expected but I am tall, so it was shorter than on the model. The shirt by my chest was a little tight and it flared out at the bottom but not like the picture"
4.0,The scarf is comfortable.
4.0,"Plus’s are that it came very quick and is cute and very comfortable and not the type that hair gets stuck to which is really nice but the two cons are that the white side is see through you have to wear nude color under garments under neath which is why my hand is over my hip and it also runs large which I was aware of but didn’t know how large , I’m 4’10” so that’s why it ran larger on me so the pictures I have it tied up and normal. Overall very satisfied! Would recommend!"
4.0,Perfect for working in the yard during Florida summers.  Hat not too tight and I'm able to put all my hair up into it comfortably if I want to.  Perfect protection with the wide brim.
4.0,"this is a beautiful top, however it took a month to receive it...will check closer as to where stuff comes from...."
4.0,"Very quiet winder. However, the watch being wound didn't always stay wound. Found that it appeared to work better when the winder was running clockwise."
4.0,Beautiful! but...  the pendent could be on a different chain. It keeps getting stuck on the little circles.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a2efe59baf1762106b635eaee361430f]] These are theost breathable masks that I've found. Slightly see through.  Slightly big on the face area. The velcro straps allow you to tighten or loosen the mask. They do not change the size of the actual mask. So if you have a smaller face, it will be a bit gig for you. For everyone else it's perfect for working out of just walking around. Especially if you wear glasses. The fog leave through the breathing holes in the front so your glasses won't get all fogged up."
4.0,What can you possibly say about a buff.  Its versatile and does the job.  Good quality material.  I would buy another.
4.0,"I got the sterling silver (surgical steel) 6 pack. I read the reviews extensively, a lot of people said that they were small. Regardless I ordered the 8mm and not the 10mm. The plain full circle ones and the circular half shoe were super tiny but the open horse shoe (no ball) and the decorative jem one were absolutely perfect so it made it worth the money for me. I've had my piercing just over 8 weeks now so I ordered these as my first change out after healing and 2 out of six variety... worth it.<br />Also note, the ""tiny"" ones did actually fit the actual whole just fine I just didn't like that I couldn't see the ring hanging out very much."
4.0,"This dress is cute, but it does run small.  I am 5'1 and 115 pounds and ordered a medium.  I can still wear it though.  One size up may be more comfortable for some."
4.0,Great boot she says but she wears an 8 solid and these are 1/2 size to small . Product is nice and she said comfortable .
4.0,I did have to alter it by cutting the leather band. It took me awhile but once I got it to the size I needed I loved it. So instead of it wrapping 3 times around my wrist it only wraps around twice. Many compliments on it. Very pretty.
4.0,Ringgg
4.0,Very cute. I read the other reviews and some say theirs came tarnished but my pair were fine. Would purchase again if I lost these.
4.0,"I had to resist the ""purrrfect"" pun, but these shoes are absolutely that.  They look great and have a sturdy fit around the foot for good support.  They banged up my pinky on each foot, though, but I wonder if that's because I got and 8 and not 7.5.  I tried going to a store to try them on, but they were sold out, so I had to guess.  Unfortunately, I didn't want to wait to resend for another pair without knowing for sure if they'd work better, so I'm hoping I can just pad them somehow.  I was much too antsy to wear them as soon as I got them.  Which was true to the two-day shipping."
4.0,"Highly recommend these!<br />Very clean and came on time!<br />Only thing that could be worked on is the box that it came in was kinda broken and falling apart, but very much could be the delivery drivers fault! Will order when I need new ones again!"
4.0,Will be looking forward to buying more. Color designs are very cool
4.0,"I like this cap for a lot of reasons, the least of which is style. It is not your standard baseball cap, but has a shorter bill than most and has a little lower profile. It's light and fits well, which is always a problem for me with hats that don't have adjustment straps. I can't tell for sure yet (have not had it very long) but it seems to be a little &#34;cooler&#34; than my other caps too. May have something to do with the light material used in its construction."
4.0,Ne encanto me quedo perfecto
4.0,"I liked the product but I bought it for my wife.  She states that if the leather was softer, she could get more into purse.  Is there a bigger fanny pack as I would order a bigger fanny pack for her and take the one I received for myself."
4.0,"This is my second pair of this brand.  The first pair lasted 13 months of constant use in the house or a quick run to the shop.  The straps pulled out from the shoe base and the bottom tread came unglued as others have mentioned. I felt they lasted long enough for the lower price to purchase again.  I have had this type of sandal for 30 years. The Adidas brand did last longer, though many of the nubs broke off or bent over, reducing the effectiveness of the massage."
4.0,Very Comfortable and Stylish! Also durable because I wear it during snow..
4.0,"I ordered a medium in this.. and it's just a tad bigger .. but, then again, the small probably would be too small. It seems to me that sizing has changed over the years to become a bit larger."
4.0,I received my necklace within a few days and no issues. Luv the heel!
4.0,my daughter loves it! but disappointed there was a small hole i needed to sew
4.0,"Its a nice dress but I've only worn it twice and it already has a hole in the sleeve. The pocket is also in a very odd place, almost in the center instead of towards the side. Works under a vest though."
4.0,items were as expected
4.0,"The fit is great also the length, mid length a bit see through."
4.0,"I got these for my 2 year old grandson. He was very excited when I gave them to him, but his hands are too small for them to fit well. My daughter (his mom) has small hands and they actually fit her.<br /><br />They look just as shown in the pictures and are nice and soft.<br /><br />We are happy with them even though they didn't fit the intended recipient."
4.0,Arrived and they are about 1” y’all as it says. They look a little cheap but could be worse. Good for a child that loves this anime
4.0,It appears to do the job but it smells bad. Also it would be better if the change compartment was on the outside.
4.0,The elastic is to high up could be closer to waist  not under breast
4.0,I bought this for my Les Mis fanatic friend for her sweet 16 and she absolutely loved it! It is a durable charm bracelet with vivid colors and engravings. Hopefully it lasts long. It was a perfect gift!
4.0,"Muy fresca , ligera"
4.0,just what I needed for a charm bracelet that I am making hard to find charms with names on them
4.0,"I love the look and feel but I wear a Large. Originally sent a Medium, got a replacement XL that is still pretty tight. Need to order 2 sizes larger than usual."
4.0,"Nice shirt, rather have embroidered patch."
4.0,"Nice big rim, the headband is kinda snug but I do have a large head."
4.0,I’m 5’10 140lbs. The medium fits perfectly. This is a quality item. Nice fabric and  gel chamois. They are a little shorter than most of my other shorts but still fine. They come with a drawstring that I cut out.  Use these on the trainer only but in a pinch I would use them on the road. For $33 these are hard to beat.
4.0,Good buy if your not in a hurry
4.0,"These glasses are very light when on and have an excellent field of vision. The lenses interchange easily. For the most part I forget I am wearing them. However, when climbing with my head down, they slide forward just a bit. Don't seem to fog up. A good value compared with the price of better know cycling eyewear brands."
4.0,"I love these, i was nervous cause the reviews said they ran small? But i found a blogger i liked wearing them and she was a little thicker then me & was in a medium so i went with small & they fit perfect. Material soft & stretchy. The only thing is the words on the butt that say ""give me cake"" the ""me"" is totally messed up the E in me is crooked & not lined up with the M at all! I actually sent back the first pair & got another sent out & the ""me"" STILL wasn't right with letters. But its cute enough i just dealt with it! Must be a thing with whatever machine is printing them, that's the only reason i gave 4 stars! I'm 5'7"" and 143 lbs & the small fit me perfectly & they're not skin tight either."
4.0,Not as tight if compression as would have preffered. Cute pattern and durable.
4.0,It's a little snug but the fun factor is what's really important. Quality material at a good price.
4.0,"Love the compression and ability to keep cool when golfing, especially here in Hawaii.  The UV protection is very good and easy care.  Seems to be good quality and will last more than other compression sleeves I have purchased before.  The fit is snug which is what I like. Good buy."
4.0,I love them and they are so adorable but the little rings are super hard to bend (especially when you have acrylics) so they end up falling out a lot!
4.0,"Gift for my son who wanted one. Looks nice, is very light in weight."
4.0,"Don’t get me wrong, it’s a beautiful band! I wanted something more glamorous without an outrageous price... if that’s something you’re looking for, then this is the band for you! Only complaint which I knew would probably happen and doesn’t bother me too much is that the adjuster rubs against my skin a bit and can be uncomfortable at times. Not a huge deal for me, but may be for those who have high skin sensitivity. Other than that, it’s wonderful! :)"
4.0,"Shipping was as estimated, and i love the little outfit! I will say it is cut a little offset, and the head band had a seam that wasnt sew in correctly but its a simple fix. The outfit does seem a bit larger that what I ordered but through other reviews i expected that and I'm sure they will grow into it at some point. But a great price for a good absolutely adorable garment!"
4.0,nice variety
4.0,very cute but the chain detail that you use to close the bracelet sometimes comes unhooked and if you didn't notice you could loose your bracelet
4.0,"These are stylish  face mask but they fit a little small over full area especially around bottom it didn’t fit snug. Upper part fine around the nose, has extra layer for each if the 2 mask. Not as hard to breathe through. I’ve not sure if filter can be washed, I need to go back and read product’s description as there is no instructions in bag."
4.0,I have had many other socks with grippers on the bottom and they wouldn’t stay on my feet. These do.<br />That is important. They are also warm.
4.0,These shorts fit my husbands waist as expected but he wouldn’t wear them to the gym because the flare of the leg is way too much.<br />The quality of the material is good and they are comfortable. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the flare that is in the leg is just too much to wear out of the house.
4.0,"These are actually really cute. I’m 5’1 and weigh 137 and I have a big butt , big thighs and a small waist. These are perfect around my waist but a little tight around my thighs. I’m glad I went with a seize medium because a large prob would’ve been too big. So if you’re curvy like me be mindful that it might be a little tight around the thighs. Other than that! These are perf to spice up your 9-5 work outfit."
4.0,Very nice pocket watch for the price.  I bought it for a costume and was pleasantly surprised that it keeps time accurately.
4.0,"the bag is much smaller then what they said, and the strap seems a little flimsy, but its a nice bag overall if your not going to put much into it. I like the fabric and design though."
4.0,"It’s perfect.. Just as I expected. The only flip side is, it’s too expensive."
4.0,"Although I wish these tapers were longer, they are made well and feel good."
4.0,"Love this.  A little tight in the bust, but it stretches.  I'm a 44D."
4.0,I will order again.
4.0,It more of a swim suit material than a work out material. But overall we like it!
4.0,"Perfect fit, and loose enough for workouts!"
4.0,Very pretty. No problems to report. Just not for my body type. I have some extra in the middle lol
4.0,"A little small for my 8 year old and his friends, but they did have fun posing with them. Well made, but just a tad too small."
4.0,"The shirt arrived in great condition..no complaints there..however the small seems to fit more like a medium..I'm hoping it shrinks a little in the wash as it's a little baggy on me. I don't like my clothes to be skin tight..and being only 5'1 and 90lbs finding fitting shirts is always a struggle for me anyway. But the quality of the shirt feels nice. I only gave it 4 stars over the sizing issue...but other than that, I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase. Thank you!"
4.0,"Ok dress, don't care for how it fits across my stomach, makes me look pregnant (which I'm not). Other wise it's cute and comfy."
4.0,"Awesome customer service! Although the product itself was a bit off (missing a piece of costume and another item (hat) wasn’t sewn properly making it unwearable), the vendor got back to me quickly and remedied the situation. After a painless refund, I can repurchase and hopefully everything will be good to wear for Halloween with the reorder. So props to the seller! As for the actual costume, it’s intricate and unique enough- a good price point for the $40, if all the components are accounted for and in working order. :) I would say it runs just a tiny hair on the smaller side, but I think that’s better than having it hang too loose, as it is made from that thin, Halloween-costumey material. So it looks better more fitted. I like the design as it’s not “slutty pirate” but more of a kid-friendly sassy pirate! I was surprised that it comes with an under shirt, over-shirt with attached lace up vest, a mock corset thingy tied around that, a sash to tie around THAT, then a belt, pants, arm cuffs, in theory a head scarf, and lastly a hat. Got to say, California Costumes has some neat designs that include cute details vs. other costumers, although they come together with the cheapest materials as possible. But that’s pretty typical."
4.0,"The &#34;happy camper&#34; is a little more stiff than I'd like it. The screen printing is thick, like old iron on shirts."
4.0,The shoe looks good and feels great. Great ankle support. All other shoes and 11.5 fits perfectly but these I had to send it back and get a 12. Still a great show for reffing high school football.
4.0,One less star because of zipper and button feel cheaply made. But they fit great and are hot 🔥 af
4.0,"I found it a little hard to get on and off, size up to make it easier. It’s very comfortable and warm!"
4.0,Nice and free returns
4.0,It is super cute. Material seems ok. It is see through but that doesn’t bother me. Love the sleeves. Overall good product!
4.0,"These feel great everywhere except my lower back.  I don't know if they are too small or not, but they feel great everywhere else."
4.0,Like the length and loved the color.
4.0,"Love the variety in colors. You can tell they’re not Apple bands, however they’re still very good."
4.0,It's a great present.  My 6yo who hates putting on hats will wear this.
4.0,"this wallet is hefty, in a good way.  it adequately holds all my important cards, and a decently sized wad of cash.  I you're looking for an RF blocking wallet, you won't go wrong withe the Sharkk."
4.0,These are great gloves. The thumb hole was a bit tight. I had to cut a tiny notch in the top of each thumb hole. But otherwise perfect.
4.0,Title.
4.0,Cute print but fabric does not seem that durable.
4.0,"Pretty earrings, but wanted to use only 1 for my helix piercing. The only thing is that the bar is really long for a helix piercing. It sticks out way too much making it very easy to spin. Also the bar is thick. It says 20g, but it's too thick for my helix. Perfect for normal pair of earrings in the lower lobe of your ears. But not for the upper part of your ear."
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter and they are larger than anticipated based on the previous reviews from others who purchased them. They are however, very soft and I will just keep them for myself. Win/win."
4.0,My daughter loves em only thing im scared to bend em bcuz they seem like they will break n i dont want my daughter mad at me so im letting them be other than that she loves em n the colors are really cute so yes will buy more colors
4.0,Pretty and made well.  love the bright red colors and looks a lot more expensive that it is.
4.0,"I am not a hat wearer, so the hat was bit awkward for me. That being said, it was easy to wear due to it's light weight and style and it did a great job keeping the sun off me.  The size fit as expected, was easy to pack and kept it's shape.  Came in great condition, and is still in great condition, no loose stitching.  I am definitely glad I got it to wear while down in Mexico.  Would recommend to friends and family."
4.0,"Good size (like the size of a spiral notebook). Straps hold various-sized electronic/office things well. Seems firm not flimsy. Only problem for me is how I store it, things keep getting bumped around and pushed off the straps in my backpack. I think holding things in a briefcase or satchel where other items don't shift against it as much might be better than how I store it. Worth the price and of good quality."
4.0,I love it! Love the texture I was expecting to be disappointed and get it silky instead it thick. & fits alil tight.  Around my breast area. Maybe it may help to wear it braless... I'm 5ft & about 160 lbs.  Fits alil above my knee.
4.0,"This shirt fits perfectly, even has some stretch, which I don't need, because it fits. The buttons are great and the sleeves cover my tattoos. I like that it's a feminine cut. I don't ever have to iron it. Only drawback is that it's not going to last forever. I got black, so its gradually fading. Still not bad."
4.0,"The fabric in the back that hangs down, ripped off to easily!"
4.0,Love the color and the colorful letters. After a few washes they did fade a bit. Very soft and comfortable.
4.0,Watch band fits nicely and gives a person another wear option however I had a problem getting the band through the loops for good closure.
4.0,"My 10 year old likes it, S fits her nicely."
4.0,The shiny finish makes it look cheap and not leathery. I thought it would break quickly but I’ve been using it for three weeks now and I am actually impressed with it.
4.0,"I bought the light grey in a medium.  I am 5’5 and a 140 lbs.  it fits perfectly. The fabric has some stretch to it. I would say it’s a little on the long side, but will look perfect with leggings."
4.0,"Overall I love this watch. I use it for work and wear it every day. It was easy to adjust and very comfortable to wear. My only real issue was the battery. I received the watch and the battery was dead. This was frustrating because I couldn’t wear it right away. So I had to get the special sized battery. The back is hard to get off to change battery. Other than that, this watch has been great!"
4.0,"These earrings are cute, the color is beautiful but the dangles are a little stiff and the ear wires are fragile"
4.0,Works great for project!!
4.0,"My grandson wanted this. Fit perfect, and warm!"
4.0,"Had a mix up,  but they solved the problem and I'm happy with the product."
4.0,"For price, I thought they would be more durable. Snagged easily and wore through toe second time I wore them. Disappointing."
4.0,"runs a teeny bit large . not as much of a fitted, ladies cut, more of a straight mans cut. But still a god nice shirt for the colder seasons"
4.0,"I Like the length of the post (shorter, less noticeable).  Disliked the length and sizes of the stones, as I thought they would not be that noticeable, but they came out too far from my nose for my preference"
4.0,This was the first ear cuff I've ever purchased or worn.  It's super cute and very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this!
4.0,"Product itself is great, packaging is super sketchy"
4.0,Not the best quality mask. I had a hard time keeping it on my face.
4.0,These are cute but the tops are a stiff crinkle plastic it can be a little irritating and uncomfortable. But for short times they are ok kids love them they think they are funny. It really is like a fish in a baggie like you get at a fair or fish store
4.0,It is what I need for my child.
4.0,i bought this item for my girlfriend and it fits her body nicely easy on easy off for her
4.0,I like the bag over all.  It is narrow.  My laptop fits well (15in) but it's not too great if you want to throw a water bottle in your bag too.
4.0,"This gown is really pretty as far as design and trim, but it is not really that comfortable because the material it is made of is not that soft.  Even after being washed several times and rinsed in Downy it is still a fairly stiff fabric with no signs of softening.  Other than that, it is well made and as I said, very pretty."
4.0,"More boxy than I expected, but still a good shirt that I will keep."
4.0,"It's a nice looking watch for the price. With that being said, the tiny seconds dial on the bottom is 1 second off from the regular dial."
4.0,Somewhat stiff material but otherwise nice cut.
4.0,Really comfortable…. And cute. Can’t beat that
4.0,"The scales are more on the purple/pink side instead of the greenish color in the picture, but it's still cute. I like it."
4.0,This is definitely not sweatshirt material. It is a nice shirt with soft fabric that is not as heavy as a sweatshirt.
4.0,"Super cute and I do like it.  It has an odd cut though, so it may not be for everyone."
4.0,"I bought this for my wife, the material is soft, it looks great, and fit pretty well. The only complaint was excess fabric on the breasts. I was able to pleat and sew the extra down pretty easily and it looks fantastic now."
4.0,"It was very sexy, but if you don’t adjust it to your neck properly, it’ll try to roll down on itself.  You have to wear it just a little tight, which is hard to do when putting it on by yourself."
4.0,Look very cute. But the bow is not attached to the head band. It makes it so easy to slide off the headband which is pretty inconvenient. I will have to try to sew them down.
4.0,"Fit as expected in length and around my body, but the sleeves are a little more snug than I prefer and are very long.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and light weight. Very comfortable. The color was as shown.<br /><br />I'm very happy my purchase and am ordering more in different colors."
4.0,"Nice, stylish and roomy yet perfect for over the shoulder.  Looks expensive but isn't."
4.0,"I got the purple one and I love it, it is exactly the color in the picture. I am happy with the bag, the only complaint I have is It is a little smaller than what is shown. Overall I am pleased."
4.0,This is adorbs!  It fits perfectly and looks so cute.
4.0,This shirt is cute but it's not very loose or stretchy. I'm hoping with more wear that it will loosen up.
4.0,Very nice product for the cost.  Would buy again if needed.
4.0,"A bit of a pain to remove links and put on the watch - fortunately I had a little watch kit for such work, as the included tool is pretty flimsy. Looks great on my Moto 360."
4.0,Nice fit...and looked good on me
4.0,Coolio
4.0,The different colored fabric on this dress make it so fun and unique! My daughter loves how it flows and twirls. The fabric is pretty lightweight and nice for summer.
4.0,It was a good Christmas stocking stuffer
4.0,My husband who wears it said it's a little too big. I can see that it is a little too big also but he is okay with it and  wants to keep it.
4.0,"I love these shades. I don’t have to choose between my prescription or protecting my eyes from the sun. I’m very much pleased. Everything is clear, there’s no glare and my peripheral is protected as well. I will recommend and buy again"
4.0,The hat is comfortable. Just a little tight around ear area.
4.0,"This jewelry is stunning and beautiful. It seems like good quality and good for the price. However, I honestly did not realize this was an ear CUFF only and no post to attach to my earlobe. It seems over the top for everyday wear so I would only wear it if I were to dress up for a formal event like a cocktail party, prom, or wedding. It doesn't seem very secure though and might fall off if going dancing. It is also not practical if you wear your hair down because you hair will cover it up or accidentally get caught in the cuff and make it fall off.<br /><br />Very pretty and good price but I'm going to return it because I wanted something I can wear everyday that I don't have to worry about it getting caught in my hair. The product came in a basic cardboard box.<br /><br />FYI, I bought the left side blue. At the writing of this review, this color/side combination is no longer available."
4.0,"I loved the sweater, it was really cute, it fit really well but it was a bad material that was very thin. But over all it was still comfortable"
4.0,"These are great glasses.  They cut the glare like my Raybans and Oakleys of the past. The fit and finish is right where it belongs and exceeds any expectations that one might have from glasses in this price range.  My only criticism is in the durability.  I have had three pairs now and every one has broken at the point where the left ear piece meets the side of the lens frame.  It is for that reason that I dropped it one star.  I still recommend these glasses.<br />  On a side note.... The seller has been very prompt in fulfilling my order, my glasses arrived well before the expected date."
4.0,The ring is rather thin and it won't fit most fingers but it is accurate to the game. Great for cosplay.
4.0,This was a tad small. I plan of wearing it with leggings anyway. Its slightly tight across my chest but not to the point of not wearing it.  Nice light material.
4.0,"Really good quality product on a very nice package. The reason I don't give 5 stars is because it didn't match perfectly with my apple watch which is a bit more shiny, maybe with the apple watch sport. The lack of this information and the difference from the site pictures (looks more shiny than really is) made all the difference. I'll keep it anyway because others would take too long to arrive and I'm leaving US soon. Took me 5min to take two pins out and adjust, quite easy. The screen protector (42 box) is much smaller than the 42 screen, but as a free gift you wouldn't complain. I'm using both, screen protector and the case which fits perfect and looks like nothing."
4.0,"These are well made. I tend to have wider arms and gloves do not usually reach as far as advertised but, these ones were perfect I wore them to cover up my tattoo for my wedding. Served it's purpose."
4.0,It is a comfortable jacket.  I received several compliments.
4.0,I ordered medium the first time and it was a bit snug. I liked them so I ordered 2 more but this time a size larger. I like how they feel and very comfortable. If you like your package to pop these are for you.
4.0,Nice glasses for the money...feel kind of fragile...but love the color of lens and fit...and I have a fat head...would buy again
4.0,"The shipping took a while, but the hat is pretty accurately portrayed. It was a little bigger than I though it would be, but it fits just fine and the color was spot on."
4.0,I like them but they still get rusty
4.0,"these were perfect , for me and my daughetr, i love the earring wou and i would reccomend them too"
4.0,"It's a cute hat. It's a little bigger than I had expected. It fits kind of like a beret. The circumference fits fine, the hat is just more voluminous than it looks on the model."
4.0,"Nice hat, a few things could be a little better but I really like it."
4.0,"Nice earrings, good value for the price"
4.0,"These will absolutely make you look like you live in the gym. They instantly give me an hourglass figure! I've tested them out really well while working out and they are great. They stay in place fairly well, they did decent during a yoga class. I love the extra coverage too. They kept me very dry feeling and left no embarrassing sweat stains on my pants or on the gym equipment. Honestly, they are fantastic as far as sweat wicking goes. And they are not see through! I'm 5'2 111lbs and they fit like a dream. They are hard to put on, kinda like putting shapewear on. My only complaint is that they don't have pockets and the price. Yet here I am still about to buy a second pair. Really hope they make the full length with pockets eventually!"
4.0,"Good overall. They are decently warm, but definitely not made for extremely cold weather. The main downside is that some of the rubber is flaking off between the fingers. However, the touchscreen capabilities are the best I have used before. They are also a good fit and perfectly grippy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Amazing touchscreen function<br />Great fit<br />Not too bulky<br /><br />Cons:<br />Rubber flaking off between fingers<br />Not for very cold temperatures"
4.0,"I have owned this watch for about a week, and it has kept good time and runs well. I've been impressed with the quality of the leather band, contrasting the stainless steel case. The dial is beautiful with textured and mulit-layered features.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the time is hard to read at a glance in bright light situations. The silver-tone hour, minute, and secon hands are hard to distinquish against the silver textured dial. My only suggestion would be to have the hands a black color for better readability. But, for the price this is a great watch."
4.0,"Cute Bracelets, hard to get on and off sometimes with their latches, and they can BEND easily so be careful!!"
4.0,"fine for the price ig/ basically what you would expect. these rings are doing the bare minimum, but im ok with it."
4.0,They looked like what I was looking for.
4.0,The bracelet is very good but has slowly start to leave the color and turning into copper color.
4.0,"This is now my favorite robe! I love how soft it is. There were a lot of reviews regarding it being too short but I’m 5’3 so the length is perfect for me! Only complaint is that there is no inside tie, but if I get annoyed enough by it, I’ll just sew one on myself."
4.0,Items as described. Arrived on time. Met expectations.
4.0,"Loved the pattern, but the fit was just a little off. The blousey top and bottom made me look bigger, not in a good &#34;boho chic&#34; way. I didn't love it enough to try a different size."
4.0,"a bit pricy, but fit so well. the only drawback was, you can't operate your phone with this glove, and this glove is hard to pull out."
4.0,"Using for poison ivy costume. The sewing isn’t AMAZING or anything, but overall the structure is fine. The top part had more support than anticipated, I don’t feel like I’m going to fall out at all regardless of my position (hands up, down, bent over forward and sideways, all that). Overall I would recommend for a single night/costume event."
4.0,"right now its a little tight on the upper thigh, but I can lose weight"
4.0,Sturdy enough except for the paint job. Poor Elmo’s eyes were all scratched up straight out of the box. My son still loves them though
4.0,"I really like these bands, would have given it more starts but for some reason every time I get one I have an allergic reaction to something they use on the product!  Otherwise the band fits well and its comfortable. The color is great, no too red and not a pink!"
4.0,I like the sweater but I really wish it came in XXL so it would fit like the photo...on me the XL is too confining I may even return it
4.0,I don’t like how the inserts come out. They seem to bunch up when walking or move to the side but otherwise it’s a nice little water shoe that will protect your feet
4.0,Got these for my fiance as she doesn't like big gaudy jewelry. She loves them and they look great on her. The size is perfect to what she likes. Nice gift for any woman.
4.0,"I'm giving only 4 stars because they arrived with the noses melted completely off! It is the late July in Oklahoma, but I would expect to be able to order some shoes still.  They didn't sit outside, I got them directly from my mailman. Must have gotten really hot in transit.  I super glued them back on, no big deal. I don't expect them to last too long if the heat makes them fall apart, but they are cheap and my princess loves them! May have to get the other colors!"
4.0,"i gave this set as a gift and so I am not sure about how much she liked them.  They do have nice ""drape""  unlike the chunky one i ordered for myself.  i think it just depends on the individual's style."
4.0,Good enough for biking and then jumping in the shower. Night light good enough also. I have a big wrist and fits ok but barely.
4.0,"I am pleasantly surprised with these socks. At first I thought they would be too tight, but it's really easy just to pull on the toes a little bit and they fit fine.  Will buy more when and if they were out."
4.0,The fit and look of the dress was very nice. I received many compliments.
4.0,I like it but it is definitely snug.
4.0,The backpack was very cute but it was too small for even a folder to fit inside. We returned it to get a bigger bag.
4.0,Wore the shirt for the first time yesterday.  The shirt fits just a bit small but it is cute.
4.0,"This is a quality tee shirt with fun, trendy, casual features.  It was exactly what I was looking for to pair with jeans and I occasionally wear with leggings.  I'm 5'8"" 185 lbs and evenly proportioned and the XL I ordered is too big.  I kept it and wear it with a cami or tank top under it and try to make the off the shoulder-slouchy-Jennifer Beals-in-Flashdance-casual-trendy-look work for me...LOL!!!  But, it's opaque enough to wear without anything under it.  Gonna try it in a large.  I believe that will be a perfect fit!"
4.0,They look awesome and the price just perfect. Just like picture.
4.0,"I had to learn that one end of the warmers is tight and one end flexible.  Before I learned that, I stretched the tight end of 2 socks and the thread broke.....now unraveling.  They don't have a distinction in shape which end is for the foot like the pic shows.  I think it would be good to be constructed the same on both ends.  A heavier material or wool would be an improvement also."
4.0,Great product. Keeps your keys in order and way to switch.
4.0,Blows off the head too easy and plastic things hurt.
4.0,"I purchased a large.  I am 5'7"", 155. This is a nice dress/coverup. The large fit as expected, but not any too big.  Fabric is soft and a very deep, black color. I love the length. The pockets are a little high for me. Overall, a cute sundress."
4.0,"Bought this for my granddaughter. It is very cute. We haven't washed it yet so she hasn't worn it. Hopefully it will wash well.  If not, I'll be writing an update to this review!"
4.0,GREAT THANKS
4.0,I loved everything about these underwears to text you the way they fit. But there was one pair out of the four that had the same size as the other three I didn't fit like the other three other than that they are great love them
4.0,"On the one hand, if you have no pets, it would be virtually impossible to misplace your keys on this keychain.  Its huge (for a key chain)  I have wallets that are smaller!  No way can I see myself walking around with this thing on my arm.  But, my daughter saw it and immediately said ""Can I have it?  I want to put it on my backpack!""  As a backpack decoration, I guess it is pretty awesome.<br /><br />If you have a cat, watch out!  It also makes a great cat toy.  So great, your cat may steal your keys - which would defeat the point of having a huge, easy to find key chain."
4.0,"Needed an upgrade to my current sling-bag that I use for urbexing and just loitering around the city. Canvas is thick and durable, and seems like it will hold up a long time. Zippers have big metal teeth that don't pop out easily (that was the downfall of my last bag). Very comfortable, has a small problem with bouncing on my back when running, but all sling-bags have that issue. Small manufacturing imperfections, but other than that, well made.Has a pretty cool area where you can fit a pretty big ass water bottle. Cheap, well made, durable, and most importantly, cheap."
4.0,"These earrings are pretty, lightweight and definitely get noticed. Leopard pattern is the new thing and  is made out of small beads but beads completely took over this pattern and I honestly don’t see leopard patter when looking at these earrings. I immediately think native. They are still pretty just not leopardy."
4.0,"I love them, they are more comfortable then the realy gymshark!! 😁 BUT i did order some black ones thinking they where going to be the same fabric as the othere ones i order and they were not the same 😭 thays why im giving 4 stars"
4.0,Hubby happy with it
4.0,"The toebox is not as wide as I would like for a zero-drop shoe, but I appreciate the flat sole and minimal arch interior."
4.0,"These are good to get when your child is first starting to walk. I liked these a lot for my oldest daughter, and they are easy to slip on and off"
4.0,"I like how comfy the shorts are, but I feel like the pocket opening on the side is a bit inconvenient. That's the only part I don't like and it's overall a good buy"
4.0,"The ring is beautiful, but very small.  I ordered my ring two sizes larger than normal based on reviews, but it is too small.  I will probably order another one as the ring is very affordable."
4.0,"I adore this ring. The setting is beautiful and shiny. The stone is even bigger than the picture would lead you to believe. I am only giving this product four stars, however, because the stone is not a genuine moonstone. You get what you pay for - mine looks like iridescent, colored glass. There are a couple of places in the stone where you can see clear through the glass, but that issues goes away when I wear it (I have very fair skin, and the missing patches blends in). Other than that, this is a beautiful ring for the price."
4.0,It's shiny and hasn't scratched yet. It fits my wrist perfect the way I want it to (like in the picture). Planning on buying more.
4.0,It’s a nice dress and good quality! I didn’t like the extra lining on the skirt and it’s not the most flattering silhouette
4.0,"They look great!!! Feel Great!  The price was very good. I haven't had a chance to use them for travel, but I like what I see so far."
4.0,"Great design, except I wish the front pocket was a bit longer to more comfortably fit my range finder. Would make it easier getting it in and out."
4.0,The shirt was very cute. My nephew loved it. But it shrunk after the first wash. :-(
4.0,Words looked a little cheaper than shown in the pic.
4.0,"These will work for the start of an accident, but they are nowhere near absorbent enough to actually hold a bladder’s worth of urine, so only recommend using these if your child is pretty much potty trained.  The print is cute and my son loves the Paw Patrol characters on them."
4.0,Granddaughter loved her new matching underwear.
4.0,"I normally wear 11.5, but I got a 12 for wool socks, because I work in a freezer and have to move fast all day. They fit well and are well made. But I will need to modify them for freezer work"
4.0,The material is thick and soft. I would've loved to keep it bit it was way too big. I'm 5'2 and it came to my knees and looked like a bag on me unfortunately.
4.0,Looks like photo but material is a little thin. I would say wear a slip underneath if you are planning to wear to work.
4.0,Very good! Good price!
4.0,Large is large.. like a men’s medium
4.0,"I am outdoors a lot for work and I need a cheap watch that meets the following criteria:<br />-: Tells the time accurately (Thank god this is not hard to do for a watch)<br />-: Easy to clean<br />-: Military time option<br />-: Stopwatch<br />-: Day/Date<br /><br />That's it, nothing fancy.  It's like Casio knows this is all I need and developed this watch specifically for me....all for about 10 bucks!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the nightlight is pathetic.  It lights of the far left portion of the LCD screen well and fades quickly to the right side.  At least it works.  Also, if you have somewhat large wrists, this watch may not fit you.  Measure before you buy."
4.0,It was just too small around the bust. Not much of anything to complain about. Beautiful dress.
4.0,"i was concerned it wasn't going to be sturdy.  I read a lot of reviews saying that the shoe bag inside rips easily.  I use it everyday to go to the gym after work and no issues so far.  I'm pretty careful but its not like im wearing gloves to use it.  I am just not lazy when i try to stuff my shoes (size 11) inside the pocket.  I love the look and design.  and its holding up so far.  TBH if it were to rip on me today, which i hope it doesn't (knock on wood), for the price-point, i would be still be satisfied with the purchase.  but you can tell the material isnt the best quality but you get what you pay for and its a good buy for me."
4.0,I love this dress . Very modest.
4.0,Shoes run small didn’t fit her.
4.0,They made my sister's day
4.0,Purchased for my daughter. It's pretty thin so don't expect warmth. It's definitely for looks and layering only but does look good on her.
4.0,I get a big kick out of this hat - I keep it at work for going for walks outside. It's pin-striped so I fancy it's a bit-workish. LOL<br />It provides tremendous shade. Really well made. Feels classy.
4.0,The fabric is very thin but it's a really cute dress. Order a size up.
4.0,"Like the looks of these earrings, but the gold setting is kind of sharp on my ears. Great for small ears and I use for second piercing."
4.0,XL Fit was perfect. Stretchy maters was forgiving. Great summer dress!
4.0,"These are a little smaller than a pair I got from the Seattle library gift shop, but still attractive and feel plenty heavy. The back slips firmly on the post and feels secure. They suit those of us with literary pretense. Plus, it's always great to find attractive post earrings instead of those dangly things.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it took over a month for delivery. Amazon did update the range of ETA a few times, but we Prime folk aren't used to allegedly in-stock items taking over a month."
4.0,Heady bandana for trying to get out on the mountain for some early season shred. These are nice and long so they tuck into your jacket to keep wind/snow out and for some added neck warmth. Very Solid
4.0,Nice but too small for the mens hand. It would help a better picture in a man hand.
4.0,"Fine product (although price seemed high), but prompt shipping."
4.0,"Could be bigger, but overall it is a nice bag."
4.0,Well constructed.  Sassy style.  Used a hairdryer to get the fold creases out.
4.0,"Thought they would cover more of the upper foot, but I still like them."
4.0,"I am 5'-4&#34; and weigh about 120 lbs. I typically wear a US size 2 or a juniors medium in similar styles at retailers like Forever21. I ordered the Womens Lady Long Sleeves Plaids Irregular Hem Casual Shirt Dress by Supplim in a large based off of their provided measurements from the seller and other reviewers feedback. I wear a 36C bra and opted for the large based on the dimensions in the chest. The large fits well. I am able to button the dress fully over my torso and chest or leave some buttons undone to show some cleavage, making it appropriate for work or date night. The body is a little loose, jut it is easily cinched witg a belt. The dress is a high low style, shorter in the front and longer in the back. It is long enough in the front to hit mid-thigh and feel adequately covered. In the back it hits near the knee. The sleeves are just as shown in the photo of the model, hitting at the wrist. The dress would pair well with a cute pair of boots in the fall or leggings or tights on cooler winter days.<br /><br />The material is a flannel cotton blend. It is lightweigh but warm. The dark pattern is exactly as shown in the photos with vibrant red plaid. The hems and seams are all well constructed and smooth against the body. This dress is easy to clean and care for. It washes on cold with like colors and dries on a normal setting. The material does not wrinkle too easily, great for wearing all day long.<br /><br />The Womens Lady Long Sleeves Plaids Irregular Hem Casual Shirt Dress by Supplim is great for fall and winter. The red tones are perfect for autumn time. I can't wait to wear it out for drinks with friends or into work on casual Friday. If you are ordering this for yourself or as a gift, keep in mind that this is not true to US sizes and pay attention to the sellers size chart. I recommend ordering a size larger than usual. Luckily, this item is Prime eligible and offers hassle free returns if your sizing is not correct. At $16, it is competitively priced. Similar styles retail for $30+ dollars at brick and mortar stores.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the &#34;helpful&#34; button!"
4.0,Was looking for a short sleeved Cardigan-I like this one. Sleeve hole a little small but it's fine.
4.0,"These are super cute and I really like them. They are a little smaller than expected. I don't have large calves and these are little snug. Do work with leggings, not sure with skinny jeans. Not a whole lot of stretch."
4.0,"After looking and looking it was so rewarding to see the smile on my daughter's face when this dress fit! She's petite and curvy, not an easy combo to fit. Be aware the skirt, even on the petite is very long and getting it altered is quite pricey as its a lot of material."
4.0,"Beautiful.  Great price and just what I was looking for.  The pendant was larger than I expected, but I am very happy with this purchase."
4.0,The earrings do not fit in my ears as they are not standard size.  They are too wide.  However the rest of the set is so good.  Great quality and really really cute.  I love it and have since bought more from this company.  They came a lot faster than it said they would.
4.0,Initial fitting took a bit and A little hard to adjust after but decent product for the price
4.0,Fits well my daughter has been wearing them since she opened the box for Christmas! She loves them!
4.0,"These are all gorgeous earrings.  I wore the first pair to a nice dinner - loved them, and they looked amazing.  Next day I wore another pair.  One of the tiny balls that holds the hook onto the body of the earring came off while wearing them.  Now there's nothing to keep the earring together.  I'm REALLY sad, because I cannot wear that pair again, until I find some way to rig that one earring.  I'm afraid that the rest might come apart when I wear them.  In a nutshell:  They are really pretty, vibrant colors, light weight, but the quality may not be the highest.  I'm hoping that was an isolated instance with the one pair/one earring."
4.0,"I am giving this 4 stars because I have opened the box and love it, but haven't used it. It is larger than I expected and the sleek design is great. Love the pockets, inside as well as out side. I'm so excited to to put it to use. I will be ordering another one for a friend!<br /><br />After using the bag, The strap broke on the first day, I sewed it back and it worked fine - After the first trip the strap is fraying and I wish I had an industrial sewing machine to repair it - It is a great style bag."
4.0,They are very pretty only a lot smaller than I thought.
4.0,Works for a while but they fit and it was a gift
4.0,"This is a comfortable hoodie that provides light warmth on cool fall mornings and evenings. I am not too keen about the raw edges, but it is well-made. I do like that it is 100% cotton and made in the USA."
4.0,"So I've had this purse for a few days now.<br /><br />My initial reaction was that it was way too big, but in perspective I was going from a very small cross-body to a full size purse(that I have carried for years). So now after having it for a few days I still think it is large on me; but I'm 5'1&#34; and 100lb so everything is large on me, it is exactly what I needed to carry my things around campus. It is large enough to carry one or two note books or a small laptop, which mine is not so mine wont fit. It is a wonderful &#34;movie purse&#34;. It will fit everything you need plus more and not looked over stuffed.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like is the pockets. There is one zipper pocket on the inside and for such a large purse it is very small. There are two pockets on the inside but they are useless because they are only 2-3 inches deep and nothing, not even my chapstick will stay in them. And lastly there is one zipper pocket on the out side, and it two is rather small for such a large purse and it kind of in an awkward spot thats hard to get to unless you set the purse down. I have yet to find a purpose for the zipper pocket on the outside.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a good size tote then this will work for you but if you have to have functional pockets them I recommend looking for a different purse."
4.0,I love them but I hate that Stones are missing from a few of them that’s a waste of money
4.0,I really like this watch. Is is a good quality for the price and no one else has it ! It took a long time to get here but that's ok.
4.0,No arch support but comfortable
4.0,"Very comfy, and will be my new house pants for after work and weekends.  One thing I love about them is they have POCKETS!!"
4.0,Fast accurate delivery. Quality and size is good. Fits my septum piercing great which I recently expanded to 14g. No struggle getting it in. Did have a problem with the gold clicker closing. That was the first one I tried. Thought I was doing something wrong until I switched into the silver and it closed with ease. Maybe I just need to break it in.
4.0,"I was surprised by how comfortable these panties are. Nothing beats cotton. In terms of sizing, I ordered large and normally wear a size 7 in panties. These are very cute and they wash nicely as well."
4.0,👍 as described.
4.0,They fit nice.
4.0,"Comfortable, warm, affordable, soft leather."
4.0,LOVE IT I WOULD GIVE 5 STARS BUT I  IT GETS DETACH  FROM THE WATCH
4.0,Love the pendant and the chain is okay but not top quality. Subtle nod to House Ravenclaw per the movies or Universal's Harry Potter World.
4.0,I read reviews about how it runs a little big so I ordered it a half size smaller and it fits perfect.  I normally wear about a 6.5 or 7 in heels so I figured id try the 6.5.  I think it looks great. It isn't abnormally uncomfortable.  I would buy them in other colors too. :)
4.0,They are adorable  they are a little bigger then I thought but my grand daughter will love them
4.0,These were great to make more bracelets out of. They are fine as they are too. Good price. Decent quality.
4.0,"Toolkit for adjusting the wristband size was a very nice touch.  After a very short time, the external point has started to wear off exposing the metal underneath."
4.0,"Pretty-just like picture, but much bigger (thicker) than I thought it would be"
4.0,Had a musty smell when it arrived.  Dry cleaned it and the smell still lingers a bit but the fit is perfect and the style is great.
4.0,This is simple and straight to the point. I hope it maintains its shine. I like it the way it is for now. I hope it lasts.
4.0,"Really good looking watch, especially for the price.  Only negative is the band.  It is very stiff and difficult to buckle.  Given that, it is still well worth buying."
4.0,They fit as expected and actually more comfy than my ugg slippers. I wear an 7 but I got a 9 and they fit perfect
4.0,it holds everything
4.0,cute and lightweight and nice athletic material although it was a little too long for my liking
4.0,"I attended a fundraiser , the theme was old hollywood.  I like this dress, I enjoyed wearing it.<br />I received many compliments too."
4.0,Very pretty but ran small
4.0,"It is beautiful and very sparkly. The stones are larger than I expected and I wanted somethingore subtle but over all, I am very satisfied."
4.0,"I would order again.  Gave 4, not 5 stars bc one strap was sewn with a twist, but simple and easy to fix.<br />Very glad the slip is long, closer to ankles instead of knees, I have legs for days.  Go down a size if unsure, the cotton is very forgiving and soft.<br />My favorite part is the lace and that being a cheap cotton dress, the fabric panels are cut and sewn evenly with the bias going the correct way.  This is a must with garments!"
4.0,Material is super soft and plush. Just didn’t like the packaging- came in a plastic bag and no tags or labels on it not even for size reference. Bought for a gift and just wish it had some kind of label on it so then person receiving knew it was new.
4.0,Very cute a little larger than I expected but still cute
4.0,"Let’s start with material which is soft and stretchy my son is comfortable in them, prints are cute love the two way zipper a major plus also he end of the sleeves and legs can be wore two ways that’s really cool and convenient, i saw a couple of people talking about the tag being on the outside for me is not a problem actually is better I would have to cut it off anyway i think tags are uncomfortable the only thing is one of them (kiwi print) fade the very first time in the washer which is a bummer the other two still look brand new even after a couple of washes but still I really like them am ordering more for sure"
4.0,"Size was good but way the straps hit is a little tight, but if I went a size up the shirt itself would be too big. Very comfortable!"
4.0,Lightweight and nice glass color.
4.0,"My 12 year old was Slash for Halloween.  We wanted a wig that was decent quality but didn't cost a fortune.  Hat was a little flimsy, but was easily fixed with a little cardboard and mom's creativity.  Looked great as a finished product."
4.0,"Very nice bracelet. I like the way this clasps much better then just a slip over the wrist type bracelet. Nice beads and leather. I like that this is 8 inch wrist, mine is not that big but because this will fit up to that size this lays over my hand when I drop my arms and I love the bracelets that are the larger ones and hang that way. This does not change my skin colors or irritate me in anyway. Ive worn all day/night fell asleep with it on, washed my hands with it on, did dishes all of that type of thing without any problems to the bracelet or my wrist while wearing it. Very nicely designed, stylish bracelet.<br /><br />I received this product, Casual Unisex Leather Black Rope Bracelet Stainless Clasp, at a discount or free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
4.0,These seem ok
4.0,"Nice bag, lots of room but I was expecting it to be a little smaller.  Trying to minimize my bag game, yet carry my essentials.  I usually carry a small card case, glasses, iPhone, keys and inhaler.  Most flat cross body purses didn’t hold my bulky items so I went for a little more room.  This has room to spare.  Wish it was maybe 1/2 the size but still keeping it."
4.0,"My watch didn't come in a box like I guess it was supposed to. And it doesn't have the little Hatsune Miku on it, but I still like it. I just wish I knew how to properly set it!"
4.0,The shipping was quick & they a great for my baseball games.
4.0,"These earrings are stylish and I like that I was able to get them in a lot of different colors to go with different outfits. They are quite large and make a statement. Even thought they are large, they don't feel too heavy. I have only worn a couple of them so time will tell how they hold up. The material is like a thick felt with the beads attached. One of the round pieces wasn't cut properly so it isn't perfectly round but I don't think it will be noticable when worn. Overall, I am satisfied."
4.0,"NICE AND WARM, VERY COMFORTABLE."
4.0,Fits as expected.  4 stars because after the first wash they got the &#34;lived in&#34; look.  Maybe it's the nature of flannel to pill right away.  I love the red dot print and the comfy fit!
4.0,Such a nice top!  Received a lot of compliments!
4.0,"A little wide towards the bottom of the leg, but a comfortable fit. Water repellant, NOT proof. Soaked quickly in light rain."
4.0,"works great as a BCD hanger, but I wouldn't try to hang my wetsuit, bcd, and reg as the ad describes. (it wont go well for you)"
4.0,Shirt came just as pictured. Material wasn’t too thick so it will be easy layer with a onesie.
4.0,I like these but I wear them with socks.  Too hard on my tender feet.  Wearing them with sock is good.
4.0,"Fits perfect. Just too long. I'm 5'3 and with high heels on, it still cover up my whole foot. So I had to go take it and get it hem. Other then that I like it."
4.0,"Shirts run much smaller than normal and pants seem like the standard size, maybe a bit bigger. Kind of bummed as the shirt was a better fit on my 2 year old that wears a 3T than my 4 year old that wears this size. It worked out still. Just would have been nice to actually fit like long johns are supposed to."
4.0,Ran way smaller than expected for an L but otherwise very comfy and fun patterns
4.0,"These are great. Very cute. Easy to get on and off. Stay secure on my feet without being too tight. Semi- waterproof. They're probably average comfort level for a shoe with a 3 in. heel. My feet hurt after wearing than for a few days in a row, but for occasional use, they'll be perfect."
4.0,"The quality on these clogs are great, and so comfy for Cush. However, they are about 2sizes too small."
4.0,like a glove !!!!!!!!!!! lol
4.0,"It's super cute, but the fabric smells bad. I washed it, but still smells..hopefully that will fade??"
4.0,fits my hubby great
4.0,I little short around the legs but love the look
4.0,Thick belt fit great
4.0,"The product is exactly what we ordered; however, it would not fit Newer Minted US Quarters. We were not totally disappointed because they fit older silver quarters perfectly, so it’s still a win!"
4.0,"Ref: I am 5'7 about 190lbs and 38C.<br />This dress is really pretty. There aren't any complains except that it is a little tight in my chest area that it doesn't close. I don't mind sowing it though, it's just minor. Has a sip in the back and it's very stretchy in the lace area which is damn awesome! There should be more colors made because I would buy it again..especially in a jade green *hint hint* :)"
4.0,"Wasn't expecting too much for the price, but this set was exactly as it promised. The tail does leave some fur behind as you go, but I only wore it once (up to you to attach it with safety pins, belt, etc.)  and it was fine."
4.0,Love this pants! It is light and very comfortable! I like it enough that regardless of its cons still deserves 4 stars.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The red zipper on the side is is simply for decoration and it is not a real packet.<br />2. It has a zipper packet on the back which is perfect if you want to scratch up any vinyl or leather equipment that you may sit on.<br />3. I ordered 3 size above my normal wear and it fits perfect.
4.0,"The dress fit almost perfectly, surprisingly! I’m 5’6, 215 lbs and got a size L. I usually wear sizes 12-14 in dresses. Only gave 4 stars because some sequins started falling off and the slip underneath is very short."
4.0,Was a gift  for my friend who loved it.  Maybe a little on the pricy side but still worth it.
4.0,"Runs a little large but a nice top. Good quality, as I have always found to be the case with Patty Boutik."
